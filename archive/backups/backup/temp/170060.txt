You\xe2\x80\x99re one of the sweetest people I met on campus. You helped me to deal with my issue and my insecurities.

At the T-fork, I\'d turn left towards Hall-5, and say \\"chol, kaal dekha hobe\\". You\'d grumble a \\"hmmm\\". I\'ve loved my time at IITK, and that notion was rooted largely in that assurance-- that I\'d have a friend in you, to talk to the next day, or any day thereafter. \\nPaths, of course, diverge: life doesn\'t seem to be too warm to the concept of \\"happily ever after\\"! There have been times I wished we continued hanging out more, that we hadn\'t grown into the comfort of separate lives. But we never really did, did we? Each time I pick up the phone to text you (which, as I\'ve come to accept, will only grow more infrequent over time), I still have that feeling that I\'m writing to someone who fundamentally knows me for who I am. If I can retain one thing from our time together, I\'d want it to be that feeling. \\nFrom the time we first met on a late August afternoon, in the OAT, to the last walk we shared on campus (an early April evening, almost four years later), I\'ll treasure each moment we hung out, talked, laughed, and sympathised with each other. Even if time flies, I truly believe we made quite a lot out of it. :) Thanks for being there to hear about my loves and my heartbreaks, my wins and my losses. I\'ll always be grateful to have known you, and to have been a part of your life. \\nNeedless to say, I fully expect you to do awesome things in life. I hope that you have a great, great time ahead: you\'re a really good person, and you deserve every bit of joy! \\nLet\'s meet up soon? :) ","author":"Bashirul Islam Sheikh","visibility":true,"_id":"60a2b48f819323d199d47df8"},{"text":"Hey Sonty!
