I haven\'t had many discussions with you but from the ones I did and what I heard about you, I am amazed of how much you have achieved in such a short time. Other than that you play amazing TT bro and I think you would go pro soon :P. Congrats on the amazing life ahead!","author":"Aakash  Khandelwal","visibility":true,"_id":"60a42c24819323d199d480c8"},{"text":"Smartest person on campus, hands down (I include the profs too XD)! With that out of the way, thanks for all the memories and support man! I really appreciate it. I can\'t think of any other person to share the coordiship of Pclub with, and if it wasn\'t for times when we had to just grind thorugh it, the club would\'ve failed. You\'ve been the best coordinator the club has seen, atleast in my eyes (and that\'s a big compliment given the history). But you go way beyond that, I\'ve always been in awe whenever I\'ve worked with you, be it competing in Inter IIT, discussing topics people will understand only after 150 years, working through making problems or lectures, designing a Tshirt or even simply playing board games. I\'ve always felt a certain ease when hanging out with you, and maybe that\'s why it was special for me. I\'ll cherish our talks cycling to and fro to RM, movie screening and board games in astro club, our discussions (literally everywhere), our \'trip\' to Bombay, shared lunches and dinners (pizzas have never tasted the same outside Sandy\'s room) and most importantly, everything I\'ve learnt from you. See you soon in Cali mate, we\'ve yet to conquer Disneyland!","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60a4384f819323d199d48102"},{"text":"Y17 ka sabse chaapu with probably the worst sleep schedule :P Anyway really enjoyed working with you and learnt a lot.
