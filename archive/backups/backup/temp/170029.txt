And it didn\'t come together, I was made - by us! Couldn\'t have imagined pulling off an inch of what we did in Robocon, had you not been there. I guess, janta toh me pehle hi tha ki Saini is the most passionate guy when it comes to Robotics, dekh bhi liya un 8-9 mahino me. Starting off from scratch is never easy. Never imagined ki ek team bana denge 10 din me jiske liye 550+ recruitment applications aa jayengi and SnT code me 1 question bhi ban jayega (ab reveal kar sakte hai na? xD). Wo SnT code wali raat bhai, kitne maze kiye the.. and uske baad, the entire Robocon journey. 2.5 saal ki campus life me 1 saal to MR1 MR2 hi banate rahe xD.
