1,"Electrical is a tough branch but people like you made it easy, Thanks for your help on numerous occasions chahe vo DS ka assignment ho, ya DSP ka, jab gangwar ho saath to drne ki kya ho baat!(💪💪💪💪)
Intern drive m tumhaara jaadu dekhne ko mila tha Gangwar n bol dia to intern lg hi jaygi and placements m bhi ofc tumne kaafi saath dia thaa prep m, uss puri journey ko fun banane k liye thanks!!(💓💓💓)

Bhai tum ek dam unique bande ho, apni achievements kitni subtly describe krte ho aisa tareeka kahi nhi dekha.
Gangwar : Yrr tum log kitne lucky ho tum logo ki intern start m lg gyi baad m to companies achi hoti hi nhi, paise hi nhi detii 😔😔
Me : Are baad m bhi chill h lg to gyi naa, thats important (trying to console 😅). Finally, kaha kitne ki lgi?
Gangwar : Yrr bs Sumo Logic hi mili, bas 1.5L/month deti h 😖😖.
Me : 😐😐😐

Last k months tum duusre hall m chale gaye (😓) vrna tumhara Rr sun n mei bada maza aata tha.
I hope tumhe finally kuch aisa mil jaaye jo tumhe satisfy kr sake (I dont think anything like this exists)
All the best for all your future plans (UPSC, HFT kholna, MS krna ), sb kr lena but filhaal k liye all the best for zomato!!

Baaki Bakaiti kaayam rehni chahiye!

2,"H!i top-priority friend, kaali (but dilwaaali), UP waali, bady-girl, (kuch common cheezei),
Chutki, chulbuli, chuhiya, ch*t*y* (kuch sirf tumhaari characteristics)!!
It was a great experience knowing you, ek chotti-si ladki jo har jaga ghus k sb ko apna bana leti h.
Once upon a time jb m bahut shy huaa krta tha, first year khatam hi hua tha and, Summers m you were a person jiski vajah s mai “The Bady group” and “The Dramatics people” k logo k saath chill tarah s hang out kr paata tha.
Tumhaare saath norml-normal moments bhi memories bn jaate h -
Priya ban k call krna
Water park waali trip
Juggling krna
Advises dena (Unse kaafi farq pada h saamen vaale log motivate ho gye h thore-thore) 
OAT m ***** and *** ko taadna.
It was always a pleasure talking to you and tumse baate kr k hamesha acha lagta h.
Tumhaara bholaapan aur humble nature baato m feel hota h and due to which hamesha saamne waale ka mood acha hi ho jaata 
You do it so effortlessly.
I hope tum hamesha aise hi hasti raho, jhumti raho, mast raho aur touch m raho!!

3,"Nare nare daa 😀😀, while writing this memoir I am feeling mixed emotions.
Ek taraf to I remember those 1st - 2nd years jb tum sb starting m u used to tag the wingies on Fb (this surely made everyone feel special) 💥💥, har koi puraani post dekho koi na koi wingie tagged hota tha and 
Dusri ore i can feel many occassions jb maine tumhe gussa dilaaya h 😈 .
To let’s keep this memoir specific to our 😇😇😇 initial years jb ham pura C-top wing was growing har koi kuch-kuch try krne m explore krne m laga hua tha and you, you were just supporting everyone (literally everyone!) 😊. I remember jb pucha jaa rha thaa ki who wants to be the wing repie, to ham sb (chutiya) log baithe huye the and it was you jisne iss responsibility ko smjhaa and volunteer kiya, honestly till this date you have been there for everyone of us and you have fulfilled this responsibility 😃😃😃 and uske liye i’ll always be grateful.

Starting m kisi k paas kuch nhi hota tha time pass k liye (not even laptops) tb tumne bahut atrangi gadgets (VR, Karaoke, etc.) se sirf wing ko hi nhi balki hall m hi sb k saath share kr kr k C-326 ko gaming 💪💪💪 room bana diya tha (vishesh bahut gaaliya deta hoga 😅) and I dont think tumhaare room ki strength kabhi bhi 10 s kam rhti hogi 😁😁😁😁😁.

Those days remind me ki how we always used to share cabs and board the same train 💨💨 and during the journey u used to teach me pyraminx (💪) and made the whole travel safe and fun.

I still feel ki you were not much interested in playing any sports as such but just to give company to us, u used to be present in the volley court, bady court, fatta ground. This reminds me once u sacrificed playing in OAT, mere saath shirts switch kr k 😁😁😁😁 (Well is din k baad maine shirts pehen na kam kr diya tha, kyuuki khelne m dikkat hoti thi). I know tumhe in moments/sacrifices k liye zyada appreciation nhi milta tha but they always meant a lot to me and others! 👏👏👏👏

You still leave me in awe 😲 ki how can someone be so good from heart, in swagy’s words “nareda tera dil bahut bada h……………..” 💓💓💗 (isse complete nhi krunga). You always acted like you have everyone’s responsibility and tried to spread happiness to each one of us. 

I hope now you start shaping your career (UPSC nikaaalo) and work towards your happiness.

It was fun interacting with you and obviously it was great to know ki tum sirf dost nhi rishtedaar (💓💓💓) bhi bn gyi end tak (😛).
Trekking k time company dene k liye thanks, I enjoyed that trek, the most during our trip, however end m jb pair m lachak aayi tumhaari tb gaand fat gyi thi (😅😅).
Last k 2 months ham log fir kabhi naa kabhi mil hi jaate the whether it was R**y* k maze lena (iske liye tumhe beech m bura laga tha aur fir baad m tumhara reaction kyu hi laga tha 😁😁😁😁😁)  ya hall-9 m sis gurad waala kaand (💣💣)  and obviously Captain k saath TT, Bady, volly har cheez try krna (I qualified that navy test 💪💪 ).
I hope tumhara pair thik ho jaaye (kuch zyada hi time ho gya😣).

Well baaki talented to hi tum, you devoted your starting k complete 3 years to drams and still managed to get a good job (honestly y kaafi inspirational thaa😍😍).
I hope tum aage bhi high achievements ki taraf aim kro and apne saare sapne haasil kr lo.

8,"Rochak darling!! (💟),
Your memory of entering the room still remains afresh with me. Ek Ladka Banswara (iss jagah kaa naam phli baar suna tha tumhaare through👅👅) s andar aata h and tum dekhte ho left bhi bhara hua h, right bhi bhara hua aur almirahs bhi dono upr ki occupied (zyada choice mili nhi tumhe 😉😉), chalo pankhe k neeche wala bed le leta huu. 
You were the first person jisse maine apne baare m bataya thaa, we used to discuss ki kaha s aaye h, campus m kya-kya maze hamne kiye (😃😃), seniors n kaise hamare maze liye (😅😅), s*k*r* ke kaise hall n maze liye (😛😛), aur bhi na jaane kya-kya.
Is time tumhaari kuch ajeeb harkatei yaad aa rhi h - 
Saas bahu waale serials dekhna (🙈🙈)
Galat time pe h*l**n**  jb koi trunk lene aaya thaa (🙊🙊)
Tumhaari bina rhyming waali shayari (🙉🙉)
U were one room-mate jiske saath 1st year went so smoothly, never I had any complaints, hamesha helpful, and a good friend to talk to.
2nd-3rd years m we usually bonded over hall ka jihaad (😆😆😆), birthdays ki treat and sometimes volleyball ki heat, these time were a few (obviously not like in 1st year) but they always meant a lot.
Always remain connected (😀😀) ! And apne liver ka dhyaan rkhna...

The man who needs no introduction, aur sbka chahita.
I remember 1st sem m our rooms were close and kaafi time hamara saath m beeta tha (MTH aur PHY discuss krte huye 😅). Hamne decide kia thaa ki hr clubs events explore krnge and fir akele tum reh gye the takneek m domino game banane k liye 😁😁. 
2nd sem m bhi ham log baithe rhte the tumhaare room m singing ajeeb ajeeb songs, Mondal ki mimicry (vo BTW aaj bhi popular h 😂😂).
Summer m hui thi kaafi bakchodiya, seeti bajaana, PUBG khelnaa 💪💪💪  (well y kaafi lamba chala thaa and tum jldi seekh gaye the) and this was the time jb pure campus ko samajh aa gya tha kyu you were truly a gem and we were so proud to be your wingie💓💓. 
Fir to 2nd year s hii tumhi n electrical k courses sambhaale h, I remember ki course kaunsa lena h jo SRD l rha h (kyuki obviously tum nayya paar kara hi doge us course m😁😁😁😁) and wing m kuch bhi time pass krna ho to tumhaare room s hi start hota tha whether it was going to play badminton yaa IPL times or Antaragini m jaana, kisi ki GPL lena, paani daalna sb tumhaare hi room k aas paas ki ghatnaayei h. 
Fir aaya 3rd year and sb log ek dam serious ki intern lagani h and day 1 khatam hua, we were expecting ki somu bhaiya will announce a fancy company name aur treat milegi 😋😋, fir finally independence day aaya and ham log gaye NH91 that was a really good day. 
Forward to 6th sem, Elections aaye, bache bache ki zubaan pr ek hi naam thaa (Are UPSC chodho elections lado tum 😉😉). 
Well fir to Pandemic hi chal rha h tabse but still you take some time for your wingies and ham velle logo k saath time pass krte ho. Thanks for that.
I hope future m tum aas paas hi raho because you are the most dependable friend aur IAS logo ki chaaya sar p rahegi to hamara bhi bhala ho jaayga 😛.
