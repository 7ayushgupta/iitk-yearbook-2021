I have never seen someone with a love for literature  as great as yours! Being one of the best people to share philosophical thoughts with, some of the most interesting conversations I have had on campus  are with you. Baaki cocktails and parties toh chalengi bro, whenever and wherever we meet! This is not goodbye its only until nextime!
