0,"I can't really bring into words my gratitude for you. Library se chote chote breaks lena, hall 2 mein foil se  gravity banana, bahar mazze se daaru peena and OAT ki chat pe wo ajeeb putla. I hope someday I'm able to actualize the amount of respect and love I have for you and hopefully invite you, rather than the other way around, to a rad fuckin party.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a62a68819323d199d48b6c,Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta)
1,"I can already imagine tum ek badi se grin leke ye padh rahe hoge, aur ye sentence padhte hi tum ek baar hass doge. Team mein tumhe jaan paane mein mujhe sabsa zyada khushi hai honestly. Humaari wo conversations waapas hall jaate hue jahan, now in retrospect I do realize I overstepped kaafi, and you handled me with respect and love. Haan tum aate ho khayaalon mein, and haan mujhe text karna chahiye. I will. Thanks for texting me uss din. It wasn't that great a day but tumhara random message reminded me of holding onto the important people. And tum unme se ek ho <3

I have a lot of appreciation for who you are, and the strength you muster up everyday (jitna time maine dekha) and get through with a smile. I hope I get to see that smile and hear that laugh soon enough. Till then, love.",Arun K Nampoothiri,False,60a62611819323d199d48b2e,Ali  Faraz

3,"Arre Arre. What do I even write about you man, without breaking into a ball of tears. Thank you for being who you are. Thanks uss party mein aane :P Thanks har class ke baad chai pakode khaane chalne. Thanks lab mein masti karne. Thanks class mein butterscotch ko company dene and essentially mereko MSE mein bachane. I'm sure apna saga toh abhi aur chalega, but as I look back, I'm grateful ki maine MSE liya, mostly kyunki we got to hangout because of it.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,607d2cc4b38952bbfbc68df6,Ananya  Goswami

Swimming Time.

President ki peeth pe sawaar Gensec. Films Room mein bakchodiyaan. 
To say that you've saved my life once already is an understatement. I'm not joking ki agar tu nahi hota Mumbai mein toh I'm not sure I would have survived that, or atleast be able to look back at those memories and be able to still laugh at some of the shit that went down.

Bhai ye mera promise hai ki Rishi wali bakchodi hum karenge. Aur bohot brownies likhi hai kundli mein abhi. And next time naahi main Tinder date banake de raha aur nahi bigaadke :P

Only the utmost love and respect for you comrade",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a627ab819323d199d48b44,Chandra  Vaibhav
5,"I was waiting kab teri profile up ho and main ye memoir likhun. Ab likhne baith raha hun toh aalas aa raha lmao. Um the song that we played that night cycle full speed bhagate hue was 'Flaws' by Bastille. Hall 1 se kisi tarah nikaalna yaad hai? Hehe.
Atleast apan logon ko campus se decent number of times nikalne toh mila, that I'm grateful for.
Well here's hoping that aage bohot experiences aur memories likhi hon. Love you bro.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,607d2dd7b38952bbfbc68df7,Priyal  Bhandari

7,"Mere kuch likhne ki zarurat hai yahan ? Bullet wullet overrated hai you know you're one of the few I'd instantly turn down a date for :P
Hum mile ekdum randomly, bond kiye bhi dressing style ke upar lmao. But who knew ki we'd end up being so fucking important to each other.
isse zyada mein tumhaare likhne nahi wala kyunki HMYM exists and also kyunki words fall short everytime. Always there for you.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a76970819323d199d4924e,Ayush  Agarwal

10,"Unexpected toh main bilkul nahi kahuna, appreciated to kaafi tha ki tumne likha.
Maybe hum academic scenes mein hi zyada hangout kar paaye ho but they were what they were because of you. Class mein and then class ke baad uss stage pe baithke with chai and pakode side mein, zindagi ki dikkatein thodi der ke liye main bhul jaata tha for just that moment.

And tune hi wo space create kiya hum sabke liye. Thank you. Bohot zyada hope hai ki wahin baithke waapas chai pakode khaayein ek baar aur, 11:50 ki ghanti sune, and dheere dheere Lecture Hall ki taraf badhein.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a628a8819323d199d48b53,Manisha  Meena

12,"The only Modi I enjoy interacting with :P Remember the Open Mics and that day Library ke side mein flickering light ke saamne me disturbing you just to get a video, and tum itne acche bhi ho ki you accepted the torture. I'm thankful ki we crossed paths and that you were always a welcoming face no matter where I saw you. That takes strength. I hope I get to randomly hug you jald hi.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a75b4b819323d199d49225,Modi Arjav Himanshubhai
13,"Kya pitai kari thi bhai uss din ek dum randomly XD Apni conversations toh have been A1. Uss din jab tu bola abee wo hoga tere kamre mein, and I was like the chances of that happening are astronomical and wo wahi se nikla XD
Aur party karni hai tumhaare saath, aur baatein bhi. But haan tum ho toh bade cute launde XD bas truck se bina madad ke neeche utarna seekh jao.
First year se you've been a pillar for me and honestly mere paas enough thankyous nahi hai. I do wish I was closer to y'all and 4th year mein ho bhi jaate but oh well.
Aasha hai jald sirf party karne nahi, saath mein aur zindagi dekhne ko mil paaye. All the love.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a76836819323d199d4924b,Nikunj  Kothari
14,"Sir, jitna bhi kahun kam hi padega.
You weaved your story in such a beautiful manner that I am teary eyed. Apan first year mein jab aaye the aur baithke yaad kar rahe the kholna, I remember finding comfort ki tu bhi wahan tha, kyunki mujhe toh laga main marunga hi kyunki mujhe yaad nahi hoga and tujhe bhi ho nahi raha tha. Hotspots aur same phone kya yaad dila diya XD
But haan bhai hotspot dede please.
Jab apan log ne wo trophy ke saath photo khichi thi kya mast moment tha yaar wo, saare bhai ek ek section mein chaap ke aaye hain.
TA saath me karne se lekar dada pe prank aur kya kuch nahi, sab mein you were there and it was amazing. Thank you for being you are, raat bhar hasste rehne mein jo mazza hai pata nahi ab kab aayega. Love you man. Aasha hai jald mulaqat ho aur party bhi.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,6089412c819323d199d46ec8,Prabhat Kumar Singh
15,"Original abhiruchi likho na XD Aur iske baad jo haal hua tha.
Bhai tu Indiranagar ka gunda hai ekdum. First year ke first day se kitne kaaraamein kiye hain bhai.
Sadly bolun ya khushi se ki I can't legally mention most of them here pata nahi, par ye zarur hai, ki tera bhaichaara hamesha dil ko khush kiya hai.
Aasha hai jald milein. Love you bro <3",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,6070b14ec5325f8b69d166b0,Ritik  Pankaj
16,"HOTAAA YAAAAAR. Vivek Sir ki lab and that entire summer was so good because of you guys :')
Apan teeno lab mein kuch na kuch harkatein karte hue baithe rehte the. Apne wo conversations cycle leke Acad Area to Hall 2 Gate main kabhi bhulunga nahi. I really do appreciate you more than I could ever express. Haan, full aasha hai ki apna actual IITK journey khatam hone se pehle we get to hang out way more. Thank you for being who you are, and for giving me the space to be myself. Infinite Thank Yous wouldn't be enough.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,60a624ef819323d199d48b1b,Subham Kumar Hota
17,"arre arre ekdum rula hi diya tere memoir ne. 
Apan first year mein thoda bohot milte the, dilli ki thodi bohot baatein karte the, ghar ko saath nikal lete the but first year usme hi chala gaya.
Asli magic toh SG ke wo 3 practice days ke samay shuru hua, jab main tu aur bhupu kisi tarah cooler jugaadke bas pade rehte the wahan. Bhai uss cooler mein paani ka jugaad karte karte hi halat kharaab hogayi thi XD
But sacch toh yahi hai ki uss time and pura 2nd year I wasn't in a great place mentally, and tera hi support tha that got me through no lie. Haan 3rd year mein dheere dheere raaste idhar udhar hue, but I know ki hum dono ko pata hai ki agar dusre ko kuch madad chahiye ho toh apan kuch bhi karne ko tayyar hain. Bohot bakchodiyan kaati, parties karin birthdays dekhe. Sach toh yahi hai ki I'm kaafi zyada grateful ki 2Top mein tu, pankaj, prabhat, bhupu, ankit sab log the. Shayad mujhe samay laga ye gratitude paane and uske liye maafi, but thanks for sticking through.
Love you man.",Arun K Nampoothiri,True,607e7f0c819323d199d46bcb,Utsav  Akarshan

I can't recall when did we meet for the VERY FIRST time. I do recall all the things that followed tho :P
You're pretty aight Kothari, you're a good lad and super fun to hang with. Tum nahi hote toh Mumbai mein harrowingly expensive jagah kaun lejaata and CCD mein kaun mujhe bolta ki phook mat baal white ho rahe hain.
Appreciate you. ",Arun K Nampoothiri,False,60a766f2819323d199d49249,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
