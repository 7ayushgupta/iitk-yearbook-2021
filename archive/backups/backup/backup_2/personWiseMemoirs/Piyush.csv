Zip-lining was equally adventurous (feeling sad for those who went to Neel Kanth ;) You seem covid +ve even when you r -ve, I couldn’t sleep properly that whole night xD. Trespassing u into H12 during curfew was no less than a covert mission :p Paisa bachane ke chakkar me kya ‘jhaantu’ pizza khila die the bhai tum zomato se..ugh!

‘Bakait’ - no nickname can suit you more! Be it muggai, research, placements and RR ofc - you nailed it all! The word ‘bakait’ would always remind me of your face when you used to overtake us on mountain scooty rides and give that badass smile!  xD.

I have a very fond memory of internship interview days, we weren’t that close friends back then, but you and Shubham (The batti lords duo) readily agreed to accompany me to TI’s interview and stayed there till 3 am. It really meant a lot to me. Thank you both for that. Your ‘Sangati’ really helped me a lot in academics.

You were my go-to guys for running, gymming and bulla discussions about life in general. We resonate a lot on these fronts - we even made bumble together and there too, you totally stalked the girl I was talking to (Can you believe that!). I am a big fan of your ‘heads down and getting things done’ attitude. I have one complaint though, sometimes you do forget to check back on others but at the end of the day, you are a good guy at heart.

Looking back, I can proudly say that you are a good friend of mine - I am damn sure you would give many more reasons to be proud of in future. Whether it be - IAS or Corporate, you are gonna kill it! All the best!

Uttarakhand-Delhi trip was so perfect - from Shastra Dhara and robbers cave to crazy bike rides, rafting and zip-lining! You were really a great help during intern prep and subsequent late-night exams. You were always fun to be around, whether it be playing mini-militia or badminton/volleyball, prep for exams or pulling pranks and muchmore!

You are really an inspiration man.. have beaten a lot of odds and I sincerely wish you keep on doing so. Labs, classes, bullas, trips in short these 4 years would not be the same without you.

Apart from all the nicknames, I have called you, the occasional gyaan session and the frequent gang bangs…I truly admire your helpfulness, hard work and ‘coolness’ (You finally made it ) to name a few. The best thing about you is - you help others profoundly and you never ever make them feel so.

Just be punctual (You better know why!) and take the leap (wrt Rishikesh trip, those who know, know) - and everything would fall in the right place, If not, I have got your back now and always. Cheers to the past 4 years and a life-long friendship. THANK YOU!

34,"From Shashi’s quiet roommate to a dear friend, Vipin Bhai - nice, soft-spoken, sincere, chauvinistic and a wise counsel, ever ready with witty replies! You have grown a lot - from a vernacular student struggling in 1st year to nailing academics and many more! Can’t imagine passing IME without your help O:). Your hard work has eventually paid off (GATE rank speaks for itself)!

Scooty rides, rafting and zip-lining were crazy! Becoming good friends sooner and visiting few more destinations would have been great (thanks to covid, couldn’t pull off our last college trip) ...hopefully in future! Anyways, got to spend a lot of time with you in the last 1.5 month (enjoyed every bit of it) - playing cards, watching movies, jamming songs and long walks (grabbing roll/shakes along the way), so I guess not getting PG roll has some perks too!   

I admire your simplicity, strive for self-improvement (Writing skills++) and kaatilaana smile! Just believe in yourself and you would do wonders :) Jahan v raho aise hi chaapte rehna aur bhai ko yaad rakhna. All the best!",Piyush,True,609fd1a7819323d199d47b28,Vipin
