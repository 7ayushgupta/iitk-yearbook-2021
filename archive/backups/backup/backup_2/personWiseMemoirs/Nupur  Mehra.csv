0,"Thanks for teaching me Phy103, that was of no help😂. It was going out for movies with you guys and managing Fresher's night with(without) you!
Although our friendship was not a roller coaster ride since I was absent most of the time, but.. I did went on my first roller coaster ride with you!
Also, are you still in touch with Ruby?",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a5096d819323d199d48313,Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta)
1,"Yo, probably the first thing we did together was hanging out with the club(not in FMC room, but in Roorkee). You've helped me a lot in econometrics, sending me the whole answer key at once. In the last few days, I've bumped into you a lot more frequently outside GH or at OAT, all what we did then was just a smile and a hand wave. Other times, we were just waiting for mails from Vedanta. I'm forward to more interactions with you.
I'm glad that I'll have someone with me in the upcoming new chapter whom I already know! Hope to know you better in the future!
See you soon!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a64817819323d199d48d75,Abhishek  Sharma

4,"I have so many memories with you, I think about one and it leads to another and then I get lost thinking about all our moments together. I wish that I could go back to that time again when we first met and I could experience the whole thing again. Lol, this time I'll be brave enough to scare the lizard by myself! Also, this time we'll study PHY103 regularly and not panic the night before the exam. 
I remember how pure you were when you came to IITK and then I started spoiling you right from the first week. Are you still taking the 'khuragh'?
I'll miss those wall paintings, getting ready together, setting up Avisha with guys in our imagination and making her eat soil!
You were like the Mom ( or should say Monica Geller ) of A-602, always doing the right thing, being the cleanest and taking care of two spoiled girls. ",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a22682819323d199d47ce0,Ananya  Goswami
5,"Yo Ganith! Teaching you CHE stuff was fun. I remember how you were panicking before the che352 lab exam and then we went through all the Aspen assignments from the scratch. Man, that was too much work! 
Thanks for waking me up for all the Kaistha's classes and the CHE COM classes. I'm able to complete my degree in time because you woke me up for those classes!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a3afaa819323d199d47f3a,Anshika  Verma

7,"Thanks for introducing me to Peter! 
How were you able to meditate between people making snowman and clicking photographs? Manali trip was fun with you. Also, you're definitely more humorous than Nitik!
Do you remember the ""secret admirer"" note we wrote for Inshu and then we found it on her soft board? I should have met you sooner!

9,"We first met during Fresher's but you were so quiet and we barely talked. I think I probably heard you talking when we all started studying in CC. Most of the times of going out of the campus in the first two years were with you guys. Probably the first one was the Udghosh Marathon we went to cover at Green Park. I still remember that day. It was the begging of our journey in Udghosh.
Also, thanks for helping us with the photoshoots!
All the best for your future and hope to hang out with you guys in the future too!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a3c610819323d199d47f6c,Saransh  Nadda
10,"You are shy???
You're in constant touch with Viktor Frankl, how can you still be shy! 
Even the last time we talked at Rave Moti, I don't remember speaking much. You had so much to say, and I enjoyed listening to you. I wish that I could experience everything that you told me with you. If I were a real Spellman, I'd make this happen.
Remember how we used to talk through the notebook during the class? Thank you for pushing me one step closer to identifying the meaning of my life.
Also, thanks for doing my part of the project too. You didn't have to do that, I was already impressed 😜.
Hope to see you again!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a13e31819323d199d47c4f,Vakul  Bansal

14,"Yo! I should not say it here, but it was fun to watch you dancing out of the bathroom in a towel in your wing. Sorry, I couldn't resist writing it in your yearbook.
I'm glad that I have you as my friend, I feel too good and stress-free after talking to you. Thanks for being in constant touch with me during the difficult times. We'll keep it constant in the future too!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a0e1d8819323d199d47bc2,Aviral  Singh
15,"Avisha, you're the show stopper for the yearbook too! I saw my first earthworm on our first night out together of IITK. You're my best friend since the day we opened up in the hall4 canteen talking about our experiences. I feel so much comfortable with you that I have told you almost every secret.
I want to dance with you guys again on ""unchi hai building"" and make you eat more creative cakes!
Love you forever!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a62a58819323d199d48b6b,Avisha
16,"""Hello Poota, Maken hall me he kya? Usse bol na FMC room aaye, call hi nahi utha raha vo!!""
Roorkee and Banaras wouldn't have been fun without you guys! Also, seeing you always reminds me of your ""Love"" photo with Ankit Meel. Why is that photo not on your yearbook?

19,"Hey Captain! Sorry for leaving the team. For the little time I was in the team, I enjoyed a lot only because of you. You pushed me to come to all the treats with you and socialise with the team members. You introduced me to the people who'll be my friends for life just like you. You are a really good friend, and IMO the best captain. You were the initial motivation for me to get out of my shell and do something notable. I wish that I could be there for you as much as you were there for me. Thank you for everything!

20,"Yo! We finally made the door opener, be it for a garage or a barrage. I had fun distributing all the work to other group members and doing the negligible work with you. Thanks for introducing me to the ""you're a wizard Harry"" video and reviving the ""chithi chithi Robot"" song a night before the scariest exam of my life. Now that I'm looking back at our moments together, I feel like we were together in so many moments at IITK ( TA group, surge, eng123, philosophy, cult meet, and many more courses) and I never realised that we spent a lot of time together. The coincidences of the ""coincidental trio"" never actually stopped. Looking forward to more such coincidences!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a0dc5e819323d199d47bbb,Deeksha  Yadav

Do you remember the motivational note you wrote on a piece of paper that is probably still sticking to the wall of A-601? Everything eventually turned out to be what you wrote there.
Thanks for the 'A' in lif101! Also, I never actually believed the Peter Please thing, I was trying to be safe... Just in case🤷!
Also, thanks for making my room the all-time ghost-calling spot! (Even though we failed Ouija board prank badly)

Thoda kam roya kar yaar.

25,Yo! We finally made the door opener. Although most of the work was done by the TA. I remember how disappointed you were with us for not doing the report work timely.

26,"Hey brother!
Do you remember advising me to do my homework regularly in Reso? I did follow your advice for some time, and then we came to IITK and I never did my homework by myself again.
You were so serious in Reso, me and Disha Bhatia we're too scared of sitting with you. Then we met on the Audi stage and that was a completely different you! You are as cool as you are hard-working.
All the best for your future and I hope to see you with your clothes inside out again!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a3a846819323d199d47f28,Kushagra  Gupta

What kind of magic did you use to become the sweetest person in the world?
There are only a few people who can make me talk about my problems and you are one of them. You should note it down under your big achievements list. Thank you for listening to me, supporting me and decorating my bed with so many rose petals and toffees! No other roommate could have been so artistic with my bed.
I'll always be here to listen to you and support you and make you cook something for me. I hope all of your problems vanish and you have a great life ahead.",Nupur  Mehra,True,607ef07b819323d199d46c70,Manisha  Meena

29,"Naman Roshan, you can never be trusted for taking care of a person in a bad hangover. You can also not be trusted for taking good photographs. But you can be trusted for being a good friend! You always came to hang out with me whenever I called you. You were always there, never too busy for me, and never ghosted me. Also, if I have played TT 100 times, then the 99 times was with you. I love to make fun of you, but you should know that I'll never intentionally hurt you. Also, you should know that you're one of my best friends. Will meet you soon!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a0dfed819323d199d47bc0,Naman  Roshan
30,"Hey Jug,
If I could start over these four years again, the only thing I'll change is to meet you sooner. Right from the first day of orientation, I'll get two seats closer to you. Then, we could have had more trips to jail and a hell lot of Friday nights. You turned me from a beast to a princess without me capturing you into my Castle. You're the most selfless, loving, caring and warmest ( literally warmer than our hot water bag) guy I've met. Still, I had my chilliest kiss with you. It will always come to my mind whenever I'll smell snow. Even your roses never had the thorns but only the sweetest fragrance of blueberries. Thank you for all the beautiful moments you curated for me, for being so selfless and loving, and for being in my life forever.
This is the end of my college but not the end of us. I'm never letting you get away from me.
Yours,
Betty.",Nupur  Mehra,True,60792203c5325f8b69d16a80,Nitik  Jain
31,"I remember we had to make a group for TRC's course. I showed the list of the students enrolled in the course to Nitik and asked him to recommend someone. He recommended you, saying that you're too hardworking (no doubt about it). Hence, I asked you out for the group and I'm so glad that we did it together. Our group meetings were more of a laughter session! 
I had no contribution to the project except finding the book and calling the meetings, my write-up work was done by the ""senior member"" of our group himself. 
I really enjoyed making fun of TRC's habits for the first ""off"" of the course with you guys! I hope that you achieve the highest level of happiness in your life and also gain high spiritual capital!
Also, were you invisible in the orientation? The seat beside me always looked empty to me.",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a7ae83819323d199d4929d,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
32,"Yo, Film Club Coordi! You scared the shit out of me during Galaxy! We used to sleep together in both Photo and Film workshops, when did you become the artist I saw in Galaxy??
I had a lot of fun with you in Nainital and Rendezvous, but much more fun was bitching about <you know who>.
Also, remember how we fought during Galaxy? We planned to do so much when the Galaxy started but managed to just a part of it. But whatever it was, it was beautiful.
I hope that we keep vibing on Rajasthani words and daal baati churma forever!

36,"It feels like I've done all the major courses and projects with you. I think I've called you every week to do some report, assignment, any calculation, or cheating for any course. We've done most of the labs together. For the ESO and UOP labs, we used to just gossip for 3 hours and do nothing. Remember how we started stealing the clay from the ESO lab just to pass those 3 long hours? And how we used to find different shapes on the surface of those metals which we had to draw? That was in a way just like finding shapes in the clouds. I was able to be my childish self again with you.
We have done so many stupid things in the labs together, like playing with the rubber gloves in the UOP lab, drilling in pencils and chalks in the TA lab. 
I wish to do such stupid things with you on a larger scale in the future. Let's level up this cool stuff we do next time we meet!",Nupur  Mehra,True,60a3ad0f819323d199d47f32,Prakhar  Srivastava

You were introduced to me as my sister right in the lift and I was so confused with what it meant and you were then again too calm and composed. Thanks for waking me up for all the morning PE classes. We had a big contribution in slowing down the speed of our PE group.

Even when we talk after a long time, it feels like the relation between us is the same as it always has been. I think we started bonding when we started to study psychology together in CC, and then you introduced me to the NH91 manager! Ohhh that night was awkward! Most of the time we spent together was in B107/H1 ( cooking up 'Manurup') and look what fate brought to me during the initial quarantine.
