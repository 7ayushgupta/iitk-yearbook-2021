Bahut kuch hai likhne ke liye, abhi thoda likhunga, baaki tujhse milke hi bolunga bhai. 
First year se hi bagal ki wing me the apan, tere senator elections ke time ke discussions lekar, mere SNT elections ke discussions tak, we grew up. I always admire you bro jaise tune Arial build kiya. You were my go-to person for Teams related matter. Elections ka to kya hi bolu yaar, wo din to alag hi the. The way you helped and supported me during those times, I would never forget. Elections ke baad bhi tune tenure me itna support kiya bhai, thanks for that. Tere saath kaam karke kaafi kuch seekha, how you maintain your composure anywhere, kabhi hyper nahi hota tu. 
Bas tu aakhri me campus aur aa jaata bhai, party karte techmeet jeetne ki. Tere aur soumya ke bina wo party adhuri hi reh gayi. But kabhi na kabhi milke wo treat karenge yaar. Touch me rehna bhai, and take care. 
Good luck for future. ",Mudit  Agrawal,False,60aa626e819323d199d4944f,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar

I will always remember the bombay techmeet fun we had. After that coordi stuff and what not. Putting up with your bizarre ideas for club was difficult, but to last me hamesha karke dikhata that. That I liked about you, never giving up. Socha that last year me club me chill maarenge, Guwahati jaaenge techmeet me, but chill hai. Keep in touch, and aise hi apna kaam karte rehna. Kabhi milenge to bache hue treats karenge. Take care, and good lunch bro",Mudit  Agrawal,True,60aa600c819323d199d4944e,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
2,"Yo!
Will definitely remember all those stickers lol. About the cover, don't know yet how to record. Thanks for the initial bass training jo tune diya tha, and also for helping me pick the notes. 
Best of luck, I know for sure tu kuch dhamaka hi karegi. Looking forward to catch up some day. Take care.
