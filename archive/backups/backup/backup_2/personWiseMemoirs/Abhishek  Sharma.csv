Although apni college me zyada baat nahi hui but the last few days in campus were memorable because of you, Deepak, Shrey and Rohan. I wish we had more interaction than we had and that our paths would have crossed more than they did but I'm sure that we'll deal with that in the future. Thanks for all the help you offered and thanks for making my last days (also the last day) in campus the best ones, although remembering them still makes me teary but they are happy tears 😁. Chappu to tu hai hi, Ojha baba hai tabhi. Aage life me bhi raise hi chaapte rehna aur humesha connected rehna dost. 
Wish you a very happy and successful life ahead ♥  ",Abhishek  Sharma,True,60a689a5819323d199d490c0,Anirudh Anil Ojha
1,"""Bhai itna sexy kaise hai tu"" You and me whenever and wherever we saw each other.
Dekh bhai aisa hai tu hai sabse sexy, handsome, cute! I don't know how, it was mostly because you kept pushing me for good, but we became really good friends from that awkward dance in Antaragni of 2018 where I first met you guys ♥. You have always helped me in campus and off campus as well, especially during the placements season when I used to be scared and you always used to support me. It has been because of friends like you that I have been able to achieve whatever I have. I don't want you to think this of as a thank you, goodbye vala note. We will always stay in touch no matter what happens, but it's just a mere expression of gratitude from my side as to how dear and close to my heart you are. Be it listening your relationship ka rr on OAT rooftop, or knowing your secret crush 😛 or even going for a walk with nonz, or deepak or even sitting in student lounge or library with you! I have enjoyed each and every moment with you. Ha we still need to get some photos together, and another thing I regret is not being able to say goodbye to you in campus. But let's hope this shit ends soon and we meet and tie the loose ends. Until then take care, stay safe and I'm repeating it but always stay in touch!
Love you bro ♥",Abhishek  Sharma,True,60a3bbeb819323d199d47f55,Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju
2,"Yo bro! ♥
We had a great start during the fourth semester when I used to sit with you, Manisha, and Kiran in the library nagging about our courses and especially ESC201!! I don't know why but a certain misunderstanding occurred and because of that we were not able to be as good friends as we were, but now to that problem has not been for more than a year or two and no I never blocked you 😆, and still we are connected over all the platforms. Hope that we'll meet again and continue our bakchodi somewhere else, so keep in touch.....
Wishing you a great life ahead!",Abhishek  Sharma,True,60a3b758819323d199d47f48,Chitranshi  Singh
3,"To the man with the best music taste!
Bhai tum sabse mast insan ho wing ke 😆, tumhare baate mere chehre par humseha hi muskan laayi hai. Tumhari sabse mast chiz hai ke tum vo kar rahe ho jo tum karna chahte ho, tumse bohot kuch sikha hai maine ye unme se ek hai. Jab bhi guitar chahiye hota tha tum humesha dete the 😆, phir bhi jitni baate aur kisse humare hone chahiye the utne hue nahi, same state se hone ke baad bhi college ke bahar mil paaye nahi. Lekin jeevan ki ek chiz sabse pyari hai, samay, ye samay bhi aayega ke mujhe aisa kuch nahi lagega. Aasha karta hu vo samay jald aayega. Baaki bhai humseha contact me rehna aur milne ka mauka mile to milte rehna aur bade rockstar banne par hume bhulna mat 😆😆.

4,"Bro! The same regret we didn't get much time to know each other better but you were definitely one of the most fun guys in our department and in my opinion one of the most genuine ones too. You were a very strong support for me in the placement season both for preparation and dealing with failure (although we both know it was not a failure but a scam :P) being available at any hour of the day and in fact, you were the first person I informed when I got placed 😆
Would love to interact more with you in the future, always stay in touch.
All the best for the future and always remember ""तुम हीरा हो, हमेशा ऐसे ही चमकते रहना।""",Abhishek  Sharma,True,60a1676a819323d199d47c7d,Harshit  Verma

First year me to humare taalukat itne nahi hue the lekin samay ka khel dekho, campus se jaate waqt tum sabse nyare logo me se the. Holi aur color run hi nahi, tumne meri Antaragni bhi rangon se bhari thi. Tumse acha, bay-nafs insan shayad hi dekha ho maine campus me. Dekho chaapu to tum ho hi, chaapu se mera mtlb dono padhai aur personality se hai. Humne kaafi masti ki hai vaise, Antaragni me naache hai, treats me gaye hai, bakchodiyan bhi ki hai. Phir bhi lagta hai ke humari jitni baate honi chahiye thi utni nahi hui, campus me ek ya do raat tumhare sath ghumte hue aur bitayi hoti, tumhe aur jaana hota, kuch aur der gale lagaya hota, daaru pi hoti, aur Rohan ke jaane par tumhare saamne roya bhi hota.
Haalaki mujhe itna sochne ki zarurat nahi kyunki humari mulaakate to hoti hi rahegi, tab sab karenge (No HOMO). Bus humesha contact me rehna dost, baaki jaisa maine bola tum chaapu to ho hi life me bohot aage jaoge mujhe poora vishwas hai.

7,"Hemlo Monsiha! 😆😆
Every time we called you Monisha you always chuckled a bit so we knew you liked the name 😛. And hum pehli baar 2018 ki Antaragni me mile the, after the pro-night event on day 2 you offered me your kulhad chai in the events ground and not Yonsh and I felt really good about that 😆. From such a random start we have made a fair share of memories mostly in library of course especially ESC201 ke endsem ka nightout I remember when we went to MT to eat pakodi and chai. And yes you are a talented person, and someone who always made me feel homely whenever we used to hang out, I mean I never felt any awkwardness in front of you right from the beginning. I regret we didn't get more time, but as you rightly said, we'll make up for that in our supertrip 😁. Till then stay safe and remember to always stay connected!
Wish you all the very best in your life ♥

8,"Bhai that thermodynamics ka exam was really lit! 😆 HSS me pehli baar mile the tumse you might not remember this when HSS vs ELS type ka mahol ho raha tha in OAT during freshers of Y18 (I was with Shrey and Deepak at that time). I liked your open mic performances, your unconventional sa approach towards things as visible from your posts. But I wish we spent some time to know more about each other. Let's hope that comes true.

9,"Yo! Though we have been aware of each other's existence since the second year (photography club for one such instance). Me being an introvert at that time never tried to talk to you and vice versa even after having many common friends, common club, and common branch. It was only this year that we talked a bit and helped each other a lot in econometrics 😆. Now that we are colleagues as well, let's hope we'll get to know each other a little better......

10,"""Damn.... Masala mamgie?? It's hot....... Pff.... Ehh............"" - Raj Nandini while eating maggie from Chomcy room.
Yup, we have come a long way from being partners in TA202, which tbh non of us remembers, but it is where our story begins. 3rd semester, being an introvert, it was already difficult for me to retain old friends, leave alone making new ones. But this is when we met (rather an insignificant meeting at hall 3 cc). Who would have thought that a meeting like that would be the start of a lifetime of memories, adventures (BPI), discoveries (still you don't remember IITK map :P), a brand new ""lenguez"", trust, love, and night outs. My journey at IITK has been a rollercoaster ride, had it been not with you it would have been just a downhill because you were always there for me in my lowest and also at my highest peaks. You are genuinely the most loving and caring person I ever came across and I will forever be grateful to you for each and everything you did for me, be it as little as teaching me in the lambrary before exams or accompanying me for a shamke at mamamio. This past month was this beautiful castle that one works to build his entire life, changing the meaning associated with each place. For me bad memories being replaced by joyous moments and places meaning more than just places. The last night walk that we had made me realise how quickly the good time went, how little we had and how much we made out of it. As strange as it may seem, we will always have a shortage of time and opportunities but as I learnt from you we will make sure to make the most out of them even if it means faking smiles and acting strongly in front of you so that you feel everything is fine as I have done till now. Yes, there were many things that I couldn't write here (including most of our time at OMT :P) but we still have many adventures to look forward to and make memories along the way so buckle up for this new phase of life with which we have many expectations. See you soon! ❤",Abhishek  Sharma,True,608e6cc3819323d199d476e0,Raj  Nandini

Sabse apt naam hai tumhare liye, jitne hard and strong muscles hai tumhari utne hi andar se soft. Apna to first year se hi weird sa rishta raha hai, halaki aakhir ke samay me jab hum padosi the tab puri koshish ki hai tumko jaanne ki, phir bhi lagta hai thoda zyada samay mila hota, thoda aur ache se samajh paata tumhe, aur bakchodiyan ki hoti, holi pe thoda aur khele hote, aisa rishta banaya hota ke ek baar mess me tumhari plate se utha kar misthayi khaayi hoti. Lekin phir bhi tu dil ka ek bohot acha insan, ye yaad rakhna, ha thoda bhola zarur hai lekin ache ke liye hi hai. Campus me bitayi meri aakhri raat bhi tumne aur shrey ne hi rangeen banayi thi, humesha yaad rakhunga mai, aasha karta hu tum bhi rakhoge. 
Humesha connected rehna dost, milti rehna (hum to phir bhi paas hi rehte hai). Wish you a very happy and successful life!",Abhishek  Sharma,True,60a68500819323d199d490a8,Rajan  Singh
12,"Bhai ♥
बहुत लोग आते हैं और चले जाते हैं, कुछ लोग रह जाते हैं और जिंदगी को रंगो से भर देते हैं लेकिन कुछ चुनिंदा लोग दिल में बस जाते हैं। 
Pehli mulaakaat to bhulne se rahe, 22nd July 2017, humara baap gayab tha, ek pal ko to laga tha Shreesheil hi baap hota to acha hota room tak chodne to aaya tha. Halaki ab lagta hai kitna galat tha mai, par tumhare room 128 me hi chaen ke kuch saans guzaar raha tha ke tum chaukhat pe dikhe saaman lekar. ""Rajasthan ka hoga ye..."" mai soch raha tha kyunki man me dhaarna yahi thi ke saavla, patla ladka, hindi bolne vala zyadatar Rajasthani hi hota hai. Us waqt to humare bich zyada baate hui nahi thi aur laga tha ke zyada hongi bhi nahi kyunki hum log alag room ke jo the.... Ab lagta hai kitna galat tha mai. Ye galtiyon ka silsila thama thode tha, kuch galtiyan mujhse bhi hui thi, kuch galat fehmiyan bhi thi kabhi kisi mukaam par. 
Lekin canteen ke silsilo ne, chai ki chuskiyon ne, vo aalu paranthe aur dahi ke khane ne mere ya tumhare vaha is intezar me baithna ke ""ye bkl aur kitni der lagayega"" se ""Thode der aur baith jaate hai"" bana diya tha.
Choti choti baate hi to humari is kaahaani ko jitna chahu utni baar padne layak banati hai, chahe vo canteen ho ya wing me ho rahi politics ki ninda karna, diwar pe batman banane se lekar Yogi ke IIT aane ke uplaksh me karakriti karna, ""aap kuch nahi jante ho"" ya raat ke 2 baje tera room pe aakar ""uth bkl canteen chal"" bolna ho. Ye yaade sanjho ke rakhi hai maine. Mast maula hai tu, duniya ki reet pe chalne ke liye bana nahi hai tu, is saamaajh ke liye kuch bada karne ki chah to hai tujhme lekin shareer uski anumati nahi deta, marks ki moh maaya se to mujhse bhi pehle upar uth chuka hai tu, har jashn ki jaan raha hai tu aur rahega bhi humseha.
Itna waqt bitaane ke baad bhi man karta hai ki kaash aur waqt bitaya hota, aur baate ki hoti, aur masti ki hoti, aur chai pi hoti, aur gaaliyan di hoti, ya ek baar daaru to pi hi hoti. Lekin is baat ka dukh nahi rahega, humari mulaakat hoti rahegi vaada raha. Ek baat humesha yaad rakhna तु हीरा हैं, हमेशा ऐसे ही चमकते रहना। 
Let's hope the situation gets well soon and we meet again.

13,"""Aur bhai kya kar raha hai?"" - Utsav Akarshan on entering my room
BRO! ♥
I regret we didn't know each other in the first year in spite of being from the same hall and living nearby. You might not remember our first interaction, so let me help. Somewhere in mid-September Ravi borrowed badminton rackets from you and one of them was broken when he returned it. No! I didn't break it but I accompanied him when he was coming to return them to you, so in 3 bot near room 127 you were a bit upset and angry too and were asking Ravi to pay for it and I said: ""chill hai bhai ye sab hota rehta hai and humne nahi toda racket pehle hi tuta tha."" 
From such a haphazardly meet to super attractive brozz 😆 we have come a long way. Straight off the bat, you are THE BEST person I met on campus, I learnt a lot from you. In a way being with you especially in the 3rd and 4th semester changed me as a person, this might seem a bit exaggerated to you but really it's the truth ♥. Being so cool, humble and down to earth you taught me how one should be, from always helping people in spite of being troubled on your own you taught me what being a part of community means in true sense. And from your sincerity I learnt what being ready for the challenges that life throws at you means. And a lot more.......
Although not only I learnt how to be I also learnt how not to be from you (iykwim). With such a wide array of teachings although unconsciously you were definitely a major reason I was able to survive IITK with such an ease. And stating the obvious CHE without you would have been impossible! 😆😆 Especially the last semester.
तुम हीरा हो, हमेशा ऐसे ही चमकते रहना
Wish you all the very best for your life! Always stay in touch and let's go for a trip as soon as this pandemic gets over or good enough to go. ",Abhishek  Sharma,True,60a16058819323d199d47c7b,Utsav  Akarshan
14,"Yo Yonsh! Finally, I am writing this 😆, now you may not remember our first interaction obviously so let me start from there only (and no it was not treasure hunt wala mail and that too was not an interaction because koi reply nahi aaya tha :')).
""So... What's you name?"", ""Yashika"", ""What's your name?"", ""Abhishek"", ""Where are you from Yashika?"", ""Mangalore, tum kaha se ho?"", ""I am from Roorkee, and Mangalore to south India me hai na so how can you speak hindi?"" and then you chuckled a bit and an awkward silence followed as far as I remember. Meanwhile the counselling service people were doing there season in L16 (Cognizance I think)

From then to today we have come a long way, from the creepy treasure hunt ka mail to second year where you, nandu and utsav became my family and as family were always ready to help me. Many times we don't realize how much little things mean so much in our lives, as little as eating a meal together or even clicking a photo as well as in the case of our campus wali diwali when we three shared our meal together in your room (Egg curry, paneer ki sabzi and roti from sagar dhaba ordered from swiggy) and yes the pictures and videos of that day are enough to bring me to tears. And yes thanks for saving my ECO201 ka midsem ka exam in summers!  
CHE classes were memorable because of it, from sincerely attending classes in the beginning to bunking classes after giving our attendance. Inspite of all that we were always ISPP 😆😆 vo bhi kabhi nahi hua. Maybe we'll do that in an MBA class but still we'll always be LMPP (Life me phodenge partners :P). 
More than anything else you are one of the closest people in the campus and I always admired you for the gem you are as a person, a friend and how you manage to do so much. Trust me, nandu and me used to discuss that a lot on how to be like Yonsh. 😆
In the end, whatever life has planned for all of us, always remeber us and stay in contact :') Bronze ko bhulna mat. Wish you all the best for your future! And let's go on a trip whenever this pandemic gets over ♥♥
With love 
Bronze Brozz
