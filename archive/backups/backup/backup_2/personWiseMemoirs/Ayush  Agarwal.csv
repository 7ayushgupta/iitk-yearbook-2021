0,"Alright! As promised, I'll start with you. I hope this thing has a word limit because it will be difficult to judge the point at which you'll stop reading and just call to ask what I have to say. Linear Algebra might've been the worst course that we had to endure, but it was also the one where we actually met for the first time. It was a strange yet perfect time for us to have become friends. Well, partly because that allowed you to steal Nutella on my birthday, but mostly because I needed someone to not judge me at the time. Somehow, I always felt safer with you. Sorry, I forgot your birthday that year, but I made up for it, so you cannot complain! You were the silver lining in my life when everything was bleak—someone who was always welcoming with a warm hug.

I still count our 4th semester as one of the best times I've had here, and it had a lot to do with you. From Psychology classes to TA lab shenanigans to binging Netflix to relishing our amazingly similar food tastes at god knows how many cafes to our 6 am walks (Trust me, I can't get up at 6!). The list never ends; we had good times. There are so many days where I recall you being in my corner, sometimes even going out of the line to support and stand up for me. The summer of 2019 will always be one of the highlights of our friendship; how I would look forward to us talking almost every day. I felt heard, and that is the best feeling there is. I don't think we had many differences at any point in time; however, we did get busy in our own different ways. Despite that, I'm glad that we've only grown closer and fonder with time. I hope our friendship is here to stay. 

Oh well, I think it's impossible to list all the million different reasons why you're an absolute gem of a person. Ugh, I wish I could say it all. I am proud of what you have achieved and in awe of the perseverance you possess. Also, It wouldn't kill to let the world see that you're a kind and sweet soul! But then, you know your worth. World is a mess right now, stay safe and stay healthy you moron! 

Anyway, just know that I have appreciated you every single day of our friendship. Aaah, I'll miss you a lot. Before I end this, I would like to apologise if I did you wrong intentionally or otherwise. Goes without saying that I’ll always be here for you, for better or for worse.  

Thank you for my first Mclaren. Thank you for the matchmaking XD. And well, Thank you for everything. 

PS: We'll always be Netflix buddies, and don't you dare leave!
