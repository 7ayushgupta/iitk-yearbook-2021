I remember meeting you first when our TA202 group formed out of nowhere, I first got your name wrong for a long time (was totally confused between anshuman/anshumal). Mene bahut jyada time tere sath nhi spend kiya but jitna kiya utne me I know you are a very good, sweet and genuine person always ready to help. Then we interacted in classes as sab bhi almost common thi. Really got a good friend due to that bekar sa TA202. I wish you all the best for your future, keep smiling and be safe and healthy.

1,"Hey Archit!
We first got to know each other to make TA 202 group kyuki ham sabke pass group hi nhi tha lol. But I am glad ki yesa hua, you are a genuine and good person (haan tu ye baat manega nhi pata hai mujhe), tune irritate toh bahut kiya hai mujhe but tujhe samjhne me, teri quora stories pdhne me and tere befaltu ke nkhare jhelne me bahut maja aayi. I got a good friend for lifetime. I wish ki tujhe life me bahut achievements mile, you keep growing and be happy. Kabhi kabhi call kr lena aapne aap jab free ho ya man ho!!!!!!! 
P.S. me bahut sweet nhi hu yrr :p",Abha  Tamrakar,True,60a28151819323d199d47d70,Archit  Gupta
2,"Heyo!!! I have a lot to say about you, but mujhe der hai ki me aapn ki itni special friendship ko words ke through justification nhi de paugi but still, I will try my best. It all started with TA202(so I think it is a very good course 😝 ) and I wish it to never end. From all common courses (except that siva sir course that I regret ki mene kyu nhi liya) to coffee hangouts, to huhi raaste me milkr baate krna we have shared an unique bond. Tujhse baat krne me kabhi sochna hi nhi pda, and you are the very few people with whom I can share my struggles without any efforts because you understand it to the level of my pain, and you can share yours too and we both can relate, I think that is very important in a deep friendship, to know each other better. Tujhse bahut dino me baate hoti hai, but kabhi vo lag feel hota hi nhi, ham kisi bhi topic me exactly same thoughts ke sath ghanto baate kr sakte hai, be it courses ke liye rona, profs ki burayian, jindgi kis level tak jhand hai, literally anything.

You are very few in the campus jo itna accha hai, hamesha help ke liye ready (whether I have to talk about anything, arranging that shirt- mene use nhi ki vo alag baat hai 😅 ) and your words can never hurt anyone. Please always be that sweet and good-hearted man (you are rare believe me).

Movies toh teri galti hai tujhe mere sath dekhni chahiye thi 🙃 , vo ek bhi meri vajah se hi ho payi and for photos ham bilcul sath me click krenge. I promise ham jaldi hi milenge and will go for a trip too, bas ye corona khatam ho.

Bas ek hi problem hai mujhe tujhse tune aaj tak mujhe aapni crush ka nam nhi bataya 🤣

All the best for your all future endeavours. Always be healthy and happy. Loadss of love to you 💞 !!!!!

Bhai matlab same situation same time me kyese hosakti hai hamlogo ki almost hamesha hi, tum jo bolne vali hoti thi vahi me bolti thi and vice versa. Hamlogo ne kitni cycle ride sath me ki hai (kyuki me bahut aalsi hu cycle sahi krvane me) but i feel accha hi hua, vo raaste bhr baate krte hui jana kitna maja aata tha, aur tumne mujhe uski vajah se class late jana bhi sikha diya :p, hamlogo ne sath me yesi koi masti nhi ki like raat bhr ghumna, trips etc (vese toh ham ek movie night bhi nhi plan kr pa rhe hai, aur tum hss valo ke sath rhti thi isliye bhi XD) but hamne academics me hi itne maje liye hai ki abhi bhi smile aa gayi mere face me. I will always miss the connection between us, dekh kr hi baat samjh jate the and hasna, samne vala toh hame pagal hi samjhta hoga. chalo bahut bada hogaye likhne ko toh bahut kuch hai but tumhe pata hi hai..... I really wish ki hamlog hamesha connected rhe and sath me aur kam kre. All the best yrr aage aane vali life ke liye. Love you yrrr <3 <3 ",Abha  Tamrakar,True,60a28467819323d199d47d75,Deeksha  Yadav
4,"Heyo Esha!!
Bahut dino se baat nhi hui (*saal se), you are probably one of my first friends in IITK, shared most of the first year together and that eco course (kisi tarah sath me complete kr liya yrr). Sath me (thodasa pass me :p) intern mila but ja nhi paye yrr but koi nhi. You are a nice and helpful person, and also one of the most studious, hardworking and work oriented person, in short chaapu :p person. I will cherish the time spent with you jitna bhi tha, I hope tu bhi kre. All the best for your future endeavours. Stay safe and happy!!!! ",Abha  Tamrakar,True,60a3f760819323d199d48003,Esha  Gupta
5,"Hey Bhavita, I hope you are good!
You are one of my first friends in IITK, from shared courses to shared aerobic classes (bhai kyesi classes hoti thi vo, bas ek sath kisi tarah khatam krli apan ne). Baad me utna sath nhi rhe but phir bhi I have lots of memory with you to cherish, vo exam khtam hone ke baad monika ke room vala dance yaad hai XD that was a hilarious night.... I wish you get all happiness in your life. Stay safe and healthy yrr

I don't know tumhe kyu laga ki hamlogo (DAS XD) ke sath class me byethna chahiye and then hamara group start hua and it's one of the best memory jo mere sath rhegi and tumlog bhi rhoge hi obv :p. I still remember that baskin robbins icecream and the complementary walk, that was starting of knowing you. You really are gem of a person, you are always ready to help (even providing us OTT subscriptions without asking for it <3), please always be that innocent, helping and cute person as you are. All the very best for the life ahead, may you get all the things you want in life. 
You are phines of our group, lotssss of love to you!!!! and please stop the violence in the group XD.",Abha  Tamrakar,True,60a3e014819323d199d47fbc,Prakhar  Srivastava
7,"Yo!!! I don’t remember the first time me talked (group pe explain kiya hai mene reason 🙃  ). But the first special thing thi, ki sirf tum hamare batch se mere 1st campus birthday me aayi thi even though endsem chal rhe, that was love ❤️ . I think hamne similar struggles face kiye hai so we can easily relate to each other, and share them without any hesitation, yaad hai vo oat me ham dono jo baate ki thi that was so comforting, hame aur yese sessions krne chahiye thi yrr but mauka hi nhi mila yrr. I remember going to canteen with you (that was very rare of me) and eating special fry maggi and talking about the exam next morning jiska hame kuch nhi aata hota tha 😝 . All those chemical classes together were just fun, we used to play and talk in 2nd-3rd row and hamare profs bhi acche the ki hame kuch bolte nhi the 😝 . Ranting about courses, profs and meshed up life were just our routine work back then and now they are precious memories.
 
I want to say that I know how hard it is to face all things and then be kind, helping and to stay confident and I am so proud of you for keeping your spirit up and being so strong and excelling in your goals. 

I know it is not a goodbye time for us, we have made a life long bond which we will cherish our whole life and hope to meet you sooooon!!!! Till then all the best and always be happy ❤️  !!!
