0,"Hello Bhandaar,
First semester is the time we have most of our memories from. At first I thought ki roll number wise room mila hai 'coz u know, Riya-Priyal-Priyakhee. Those late night talks, teasing you to hear 'bas kar na', little ""konsi light jalne deni hai room pe"" vali convos, etc. But my favourite will be you switching off my alarm that day when I had to go for PE :P Dancing to 'Exercise' in the morning, and how you would just scare me off studying at 5am beside me, while I turned in sleep. Lots of love and All the best <3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a634cd819323d199d48c06,Priyal  Bhandari
1,"Hello!
Discussing assignments and sharing groups was fun with you. Taking projects to another level and scoring good grades🅰️ together, we had good interactions. Let's get together sometime and have more informal talks.😄",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a2b6f3819323d199d47dfd,Ashutosh  Ranjan
2,"Hi!
We got introduced to each other after quite a while, but with everything nice. Be it making plans, playing UNO, vibing to music or late night gossips, we've enjoyed them all. To more meals together and settling up on Splitwise. You two look really cute together❤️. Always stay the same. We'll keep meeting kyuki Swati ko mai apne saath le jaa rhi😜.",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a2b8bb819323d199d47e00,Atishay  Shrivastava
3,"Yo girl, we have had our special moments only in the last semester but those were really fun, you are caring and funny which is a rare combination to find <3. I am glad we would get to spend more time together #MasterWoman . We'll be good friends, I am sure :D",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a17443819323d199d47c85,Chitranshi  Singh
4,"Hey Homie! Our friendship has spanned over our whole stay at campus, from the Orientation to leaving hostel. The giggles in between lectures, discovering new roads to reach L20 and that Hall 3 ke saamne vali gol gappe party XD. I still remember how we used to stick around throughout Orientation 2018 and choose the interesting sessions. It felt like home around you always, be it the quarantine or any other time we were together. You are really supportive and helpful and I need to explicitly mention this: how I could knock on your door at any time of the day or night. Discovering new places was even more fun with you and how we resonate with each other is a story in itself. Mess sath me jane vala inherent and understood rule: it is not something you have with everyone. Milte to rahenge hi, but I really wish we get to be around at some point. <3 <3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a14c23819323d199d47c63,Deeksha  Yadav

6,"We had first met in Orientation 2018, when Sowmya came to campus. We have had a few interactions throughout but the last two months were very fun with you, be it those beauty sessions, playing Holi or gossipy nights. We'll together dance sometime soon🕺 and we need more pics together. All the best for your future endeavors. Love you! ❤️",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a2b387819323d199d47df5,Jetti Ramya Chowdary
7,"Hey! I remember we first talked outside the Lunge when you asked a doubt in some Fluids course. Since then, we have had some small talks. You are a nice person! All the best for your future endeavours <3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a64d58819323d199d48ddb,Krishan  Kumar
8,"The random conversations on the mess table, about internships and things, waves outside Hall 1.. and the GH photoshoot, you are a nice girl, be as you are! With love <3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a642f0819323d199d48d0c,Nikita  Singh
9,"Hey buddy! It was nice to meet you everytime we met. About you, The civil guy who is very good at coding is the first thing I got to know.😛 Yes, we are very similar and we notice the same things in situations.. We had a meetup planned since long, and har baar jab call kri to we were like ""haa milte hai"", Goa me plan banane ki kitni koshish kari.. are haa, we booked the same stay, again similarity of choices! Abhi jo jo plans banaye hain, zarur execute karenge 😄 Happy ki though kaafi baad me, but we met❤️",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a64935819323d199d48d92,Nimish  Agarwal
10,"Hello!
We met in the first year and then there was no looking back, ""Yaar ye assignment kaise kiya?"" was in most of our conversations. academic area jaane ke naye raaste dhundhna aur vo Hall3 ke saamne wali GolGappa party (I wish we had more of those). Tmhara ""Arry behen"" aur ""Chal na"" humesha yaad rhega. Humare saath ki photos ki scarcity hai thodi, tmhe campus wapas aana chahiye tha na! Dancing in Antaragini and that sleepover on Deeksha's birthday are my favourite memories with you <3<3 , we will surely create more! :D",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a17987819323d199d47c8a,Nitesh
11,"YO! We have done so many things together, Freshers' Night, Udghosh, Studying together, etc etc. We got busy in the middle sometimes but were always back together with another bang! <3 Movie Nights with you are fun, and our photo shoots are even (funnier? nah, cool-er). Being in the same teams was our hobby, and playing around during work was our choice. First year me kitna NCL, CC, Library gaye sath me aur MTH ke buk vali vo hot chocolate, yummm! I really remember most of my first year with you and barely was a time when you were not there. Love you for who you are and I want to meet you now *inserts puppy face vala emoji* And yes, our longg emoji vali chats :P were love! Mil naaaa.",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a1505a819323d199d47c6c,Nupur  Mehra
12,"For you, writing a memoir doesn't make much sense as we did not first meet here and we are not going to get distant after this. This was a phase in our life long friendship. We started out as buddies here, and we have shared a lot of time together. You were a part of almost all the ventures we had and you surely will be in the days to come. :D To mention, it is difficult to keep you awake on a night-out, but it so fun to have night-outs with you. You got over your photo-phobia (finally). You may be an introvert to others, but we bring out your talkative self by just saying and asking the right things. I love the online game battles we have time to time, also the art showoffs are quite enjoyable. Continue being the real critic and keep saying stuff you feel without the hesitation of how we'll feel about it. Let's again go for shopping together :P and yes, more trips with you!",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a169b1819323d199d47c7e,Prakhar  Srivastava
13,"Hey Prashant!
I remember you as a hardworking person, who always finds innovative ways to do things. First, before we met I had only seen you in conversation with instructors for marks😛. After you were in the ML group I got to know you better and you really helped me in assignments and projects. You have that humbleness and you talk from your heart. ❤️  You are a really caring person and how you always told everyone to take care at the time of lockdown was really touching. Your writing style where you complete the conversation is hilarious😂. You are a good friend, stay the same!😊Stay in touch always.. ",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a694a3819323d199d490fc,Prashant  Chouhan
14,"Hey roomie!
You are the cutest girl in our batch, I know I fake promised you to change my branch to mechanical but I did not :P, to preserve your uniqueness in the batch. Starting from the beginning, you helped me learn how to ride a bicycle, helped me make my hair. You were always there to answer my ""Theek toh lag rhi hun na?"". Motivating you, the lazy-sloth, to accompany me to the canteen was never fun. Thank you for the numerous cycle rides and also for your bicycle (sometimes), I still have its keys on my keychain. We have watched movies together, helped each other choose dresses and what not, you were always by my side throughout my stay and I really missed you a lot when you were shifted to A-B block (specially for scaring those preachers away from my room). Meet me soon, sending virtual hugs <3<3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a299d1819323d199d47dab,Priyakhee  Kachari
15,"Hey!
The most unexpected friendships yield the most beautiful results. I have fun remembering you as the Punjabi guy jisko maine ""Laung Elaichi"" wale song ka matlab bataya hai😂. The UNO games, the good music and the pictures that we take from your phone are some of the things that I'll never forget. Keep meeting and all the best for EXL😜.",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a2bc72819323d199d47e10,Rahul  Jindal
16,"TA201 me CAD vala saara kaam karne ke liye bahut thanks. And for solving our humare group conflicts also. You are a really cool person and be it always. The first thing I remember knowing about you is that Pranshu ke bacche ho tum and it is stuck in your bio too. :D Little did we know ki jis project ka idea lab band hone se pehle bhaagte bhaagte decide kra, use second best ka award milega :P",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a63bd2819323d199d48c79,Ritik  Pankaj
17,"Yo partner! From Orientation to PE runs, you have been just next, ofcourse 582-583. Psychology and Art are definitely our common interests. Our slow jogging and shortcuts in PE were hilarious. With Lots of Love <3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a638ce819323d199d48c42,Ritika  Ajmera
18,"Hey Dassa boi!
We first got acquainted in Geoinformatics lab. Before that I had never thought you were this friendly. Discussing problems and assignments and having fun group video calls with you, both are really fun and enjoyable with you. I love the range of topics that is there in conversations with you. All the best for your UPSC preparation, I'm sure you're gonna crack it.",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a2ba25819323d199d47e06,Shivansh  Tripathi
19,"Hey!
We have made countless memories and found unending similarities in such a short amount of time. Friends bane kaafi baad me but we are one of the best now, the long gossips in those breezy nights, the never-ending games of UNO, vibing to the same music and having dinner together we have only bonded further. I know our friendship has a long way to go. I find your way of narrating things really funny, how we can share each and every thing with the surety that it is not going to get to someone else's ears. You are good at heart, sweet by nature and you care a lot. I love you for being the cutest friend and our choices match like siblings. I always get good pictures with you and I hope to get a lot betters <3 . See ya soon gal!",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a17d02819323d199d47c8b,Swati  Upadhyay
20,"Remember our first year vali english chats? From that, to the day we were teaching you Hindi words. You had painted the wall in your room really funny! We always had small talks, in washrooms, in rooms, in the lift, anytime we caught the sight of each other! SHHHHHing you on holi and that call will be remembered. All the best <3",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a64e52819323d199d48dee,Thanya  B
21,"Hello College buddy!
We met for Udghosh and then there was no ending to the number of meetups we've had. You have irritated us a lot on some occasions but you've always been constant with us (+c wala) :P and at times a problem solver. Your conversations with us have been deep and yet we were never afraid of giggling in between❤️. We made a great team in Udghosh and a fun group to go out with. You're also a fun person to wach movies with. Humari photos kheechne me thode kam nakhre kiya karo aur har baar ye mat pooncha kro kahan upload krni hai? Kabhi kabhi thodi kam zid kiya kro to shayad aur maza aye trips me... Anyways, you are unique in your own ways and maza hi aata hai tumhare against team up karke sometimes... We make a perfect 4-logo ka group for late night convos. Agli baar video call krna toh nazarein screen pr rakhna 😒. Tumhari treat par hum log apni pasand ka restaurant choose krenge high grosser.. We have rreally spent so much time together!",Riya  Katiyar,False,60a2a67d819323d199d47dc3,Tushank  Gupta
22,"Hey Utkarsh! Pranaam🙏🏻Fashion Show, NSS, Civil, Udghosh.. har chiz to same hai humari. Your birthday treat in first year was so much fun!(pole dance 😛 ke liye) Numerous NH91 outings, Udghosh meetings, classes me sath baithna are things I will cherish the most. Your vibe is amazing and how you are always energetic and happy is something I love! ❤️ IAS bano jaldi se aur vapas se free ho thoda😁 NSS was more fun with you and har last minute pe solution laane ke liye I am grateful to you. Yaad hai TA202 vali deewar jump krke aye the lab ek baar, ab vo deewar hi tod di hai campus valo ne🤣",Riya  Katiyar,False,60a6842b819323d199d4909e,Utkarsh  Singh
23,"I still remember tum uss din kitni der tak wait kr rhe the ki milling ho jaye aur tum group ke liye pucho. Fighting over who is better at art, career chats in Hall 2 canteen, tumhe GH ke votes se senator banwana, wow! We still need an off campus meeting. Ghar kab ja rahi mai ye tumne pucha nahi memoir me, strange. I love the kind of bond we have. :D",Riya  Katiyar,True,60a63744819323d199d48c2d,Vineet  Shukla
