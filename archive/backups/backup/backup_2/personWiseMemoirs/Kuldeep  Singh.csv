Jab bhi mileneg wo project waali famous line zaroor bolnege ""bhai aaj se suru karte hai"". Baaki saath m ladkiyon k baare m discussion to hmesha yaad hi rahega. Quarantine m hall 4 m tumahre saath ki gayi walk (Jisme tumahri sis guard se fat ti thi), You movies suggestions, your support as a brother in bakchodi.... I'm always gonna miss that. I'll always be there for any bakchodi with you..... Milte rhna tum to pas m hi hoge....Aur haan Tata m zaroor pata lena kisi ko jab tak m milne aau.....

6,"I wish I could write a book on you over a period of few months as every second I spent with you were exhilarating for me. I saw you on your Birthday for the first time and tried to gift you that pink foam balloon and passed out while looking at you as you were always such a beauty. Just your name is enough to fill me with enthusiasm that was the reason that I was able to get up from my bed and went to 8am class  to write down your name on the board. HSS to bhana tha, mera motivation to tumse hi tha wahan aane ka. Then came Tauu project, I can recall that you made our door opener a success when all of us gave up on that, even that lab was never tiring for me becuase of you. I used to ask people(nitesh, shrey...) about you and always tried to figure out some possibilities to steal some moments with you. You were one of the inpiration for me that I came back to that campus in those last months of my final year. Starting with chai samosa in canteen till almost daily nightouts, daily nayi nayi building dhoondhna, naye naye raston par jaakar sis guard k bolne par wapas aana, OAT m KK ka concert dekhna, ya Holi k din illegel tareeke se bahar ghoomkar aana, wapas aakr hall 13 ki canteen m khakar fir se ghoomne nikal jaana, Hall 2 se NCL ki taraf waali road par alag alag ped k naam par ladai karna,then NCL m paani peene k bhane sis guard ka ch***ya kaatna, wahan se nikalkar Helicoptor building ki chhat par jaakar uss breez ko feel karna, beech m yahi kahin IME building m poster k peeche deshbhakti dikhana, aur bahar nikalkar alag alag flowers par gyaan jhadna, Environmental bulding m fountain k paani par stone ko jump karana, RM k top floor se kanpur ko taadna, aur late raat bhootiya feeling m ""Mere dholna sun"" bjana, fir auditorium waale raste par pedo m alag alga insaano ki sakal dhoondhna, aage illegal tareeke se Park 67 m entry maarna,  wapas aate hue director waali road par pandey aur shrey ko race lgane k liye majboor karna, beech m tumahra hostel zaroor aayega par ye ghoomne ka silsila abhi thode hi khatam hoga, abhi to chawpati par dahi kawab bhi to khana hai, fir daaru ki planning bhi to karni hai (I really miss ki m tum logo k saath mahi pi paaya, but this isn't the ending) all centered around you and you only, ye sab to ek din ka chhota sa hissa hai, aise kitne hi din ham log saath m bakchodi kiye hai. How can I ever forget that sweet girl who came to meet me in my deadly quarantine(though again illegal :) ) and put a smile on my face. You are an epitome of inspiration for me. I have braged about you infront of almost everone I had known. I wanna live that life again... You made my days worthy to remember in the campus...You are the sweetest, cutest, enthusiatic, fantastic, heartful, adventuress, damn beautiful, girl I have ever met. I miss you and will always...Milte rhna, abhi to trip karna hai, daru pini hai, alumni banke wapas se campus ghoomna hai... even a lifespan will be less itni masti karni hai and what not. I'm eager to see you again, again kanpur wapas ka aane ka motivation degree se jyada tum hi ho....I'll always be there for you for anything, any sort of bakchodi.... 
see you soon

7,"I don't know how to recall about the ultimate person in IITK. You are the epitome of perfection for me. Almost 3.5 saal inferiority complex m raha, but when I met you, I found an awesome friend in you jo party dene m nahi darta. I'm proud that I met a person like you as even today I brag about you in front of people that you are such a nice personality. I hope korea m tumhe artificial ki jagah original maal milega. Ghar par R***iputram ki parampara ko aage badhaya hoga tumne. Apni dosti kam time k liye thi ye matter nahi karta, but ye pichhle 3 saal se bhi jyada bakchod thi ye matter karta hai, aur aage bhi hmesha hi rahegi, Those perfect shots in moonlight at the top of helicopter building, that illegal breach in environmental building, that IPL match, library k peeche ki wo forcefully bnayi gayi candid photo(ye shailab to kitna bada ......... hai), airstrip tak pahuchne ki nakam kosis and of course your choice of songs, how can I ever forget that and pretty much sure I will never get those moments back. I gave you some fever and cough as a parting gift as you followed me to quarantine in those last moments, no need to thank me for that. I I wanna see you in living a balanced life to jaldi se kisi ko pata le aur milwana zaroor. I'll be one of the first persons to buy your novel and go through it. I miss you brother..... Milte rhna jab bhi moka mile.... I'll always be there for you for anything for any sort of bakchodi....",Kuldeep  Singh,True,60a6107b819323d199d489dd,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal

10,"To chaliye milate hai tumhe apni chapu dost Jaya se jo whatsapp DP tak lgane m dimaag lgati hai....CC m ghanto bitane waali jaya ki bakchodi wali personality, kam hi log dekh paaye, I was one of those luckey persons. This rivelry started from second year and of course will contiue forever... but let me recall those last few years... we got to know each other after our first long talk in CC, again jahan ham dono apna apna rr kiye the, isme ham dono hmesha ek doosre se compete karte, kyuki kahin aur tumse compete karne ki meri aukaat nahi hai....I got a chance a to look at the human inside you after my favourite treat of momos given by you, kya hi thi wo raat, we almost became business partners on that day bas business abhi tak nahi khul paaya apna, I hope aage khul paayega. But that business idea was as unique as this friendship is: ""ek dukhi insaan ko doosre jyada dukhi insaan se milwana"". We both inspired each other ki fraud kaise maarna hota hai, whether it was a project under Himanshu sir, or was it a course under arnab. Khair padhai likhai se door chalte hai kyuki yahan tum ulta mujhe inspire karti ho, aur bakchodi par wapas aate hai, I remember that unique exam of all the tharki boys you took in chemical freshers ""Jisme hme 20 30 ladkiyon k naam btane the from our batch"" and we all failed in that. We both shared the same interests whether it was a trip plan to Goa (Jo wahan hoga, wo wahin rah jaayega) or it was a boring subject of mass transfer (of course I still have that sketch made by you in mass transfer class). Things always got spicy between us whenever we used to plan someone's marriage on OAT rooftop or discuss someone's breakup in NCL or in long night walks. I'm blessed to have a friend like you jo hmesha mere khane ka payment kar deta, you were the reason I got a chance to visit GH's canteen, wrna m kahan himmat kar pata GH m ghusne ki. Even though it's been a while since I met yoo last time but never felt that you're ever going away from me, this friendship is still as strong as it was ever(though tera phone abhi tak thik nahi hua).....Yar ek trip se kya hoga, mujhe jyada karne hai but pata nahi kab tum ghar se nikalogi, m to hmesha taiyar hoo tere saath bhagne ko but it seems mujhe hi aana padega tujhe tere ghar se kidnap karne....I wanted to roam around again in those lonely streets of campus but I missed that chance.... I miss you buddy... I hope this wait will be over soon and I will get a chance to discuss another dukh bhari khani of someone with you on a ""treat by you"". I'll always be there for any sort of bakchodi with you just never forget to ping me once.... ",Kuldeep  Singh,False,60a6b2ef819323d199d49186,Jaya  Maheswari
