0,"In our first year, we'd cycle back together late every night- remember? At the T-fork, I'd turn left towards Hall-5, and say ""chol, kaal dekha hobe"". You'd grumble a ""hmmm"". I've loved my time at IITK, and that notion was rooted largely in that assurance-- that I'd have a friend in you, to talk to the next day, or any day thereafter. 
Paths, of course, diverge: life doesn't seem to be too warm to the concept of ""happily ever after""! There have been times I wished we continued hanging out more, that we hadn't grown into the comfort of separate lives. But we never really did, did we? Each time I pick up the phone to text you (which, as I've come to accept, will only grow more infrequent over time), I still have that feeling that I'm writing to someone who fundamentally knows me for who I am. If I can retain one thing from our time together, I'd want it to be that feeling. 
From the time we first met on a late August afternoon, in the OAT, to the last walk we shared on campus (an early April evening, almost four years later), I'll treasure each moment we hung out, talked, laughed, and sympathised with each other. Even if time flies, I truly believe we made quite a lot out of it. :) Thanks for being there to hear about my loves and my heartbreaks, my wins and my losses. I'll always be grateful to have known you, and to have been a part of your life. 
Needless to say, I fully expect you to do awesome things in life. I hope that you have a great, great time ahead: you're a really good person, and you deserve every bit of joy! 
Let's meet up soon? :) ",Bashirul Islam Sheikh,True,60a2b48f819323d199d47df8,Aditya  Sonthalia
1,"Hi. :)
I just replied to your text: sorry for the delay! :D And I'm not at all happy at the social-reciprocation-obligation you've thrust on me by writing that sweet little memoir. Or maybe I am delighted-- I'm getting a chance to write about me (well, partly :P)!
Thanks for putting up with my antics and my disappearances, for being there each time I've needed a friend (except for all the times you haven't picked up the phone :P), and for all the treats the future-you is about to give the future-me. 
In our countless hours of dissecting life, you've proven to be a phenomenally understanding listener-- and utterly, truly mad, but let's leave that aside for the moment-- and you've shown me how much you're willing to accept and change, for the sake of those that you care about. You have this crazy/amazing way of inspiring confidence and independence in those around you, and I'm eternally thankful for that (not that I myself needed any :P). 
If you ever apply to be a saint (is that a thing?), hit me up for an LoR. Although it'll be difficult to come up with anything nice about you, I'll try to.. :P And guess what-- I'll leave out the trysts with alcohols and cannabinoids too! ;) 
Also, let's go a bit easy on the crushes for now, shall we? :P
P.S.: Make the trip happen! ",Bashirul Islam Sheikh,True,60a2c0de819323d199d47e1d,Inshu  Namdev
