3,"I borrowed this one from work, and, afraid of doing damage to its white binding, I bought a cloth cover, originally no doubt intended for bibles, to protect the book from smudges or anything else untoward. That covering became symbolic as I dived into this memoir of hiding, transformation, and reversals. In the Darkroom follows feminist scholar Susan Faludi as she reunites with her estranged father, who is now living as a woman in the Budapest of her youth. Her father survived the Holocaust through disguises and subterfuge, then found refuge after the war in depictions of women on film; she is proud to show her daughter the life she has made in Budapest, even as right wing nationalism grows around her. Susan Faludi frankly discusses her struggle to accept her father, both in her estrangement and in her new life as woman, and reading the memoir of an old school feminist figure out how to be trans-inclusive is one of the most heartwarming things you’ll ever come across.",Sajal  Chaurasia,False,60a54306819323d199d48473,Kevlin

7,"Bhai CS779 ne hi mera tera introduction karwaya(special thanks to Jinang and Vivek:)). Lekin jo experience raha vo bohot thrilling raha. From Dirac Delta deadlines of NLP to Horrible Midsem presentation to defending our position on leaderboard to defeating Duluth Grad by pulling a night out, it was one hell of a thrilling journey. Looking forward to more such interesting ML journeys:) ",Sajal  Chaurasia,True,60a6655b819323d199d48f7f,Shashank  Shailabh
