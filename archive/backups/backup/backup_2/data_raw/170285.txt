You were my closest friend at IITK and my goto person for doubts, questions, random bulla, scientific/unscientific talk, help, enlightenment, imaginative theories, jokes, depression talk, w**d, or literally anything that a human could think of. There are so many memories we have together that it is hard to recall all of them. You started off as a quiet smart guy, but soon became our teacher in every course. I vividly remember the long tiring talk you gave on Goodstein\'s Theorem in the first year which none of us quite understood but it was still so fun listening to it. The canteen and pizza hangouts were my favourite. Pepper Barbecue Medium (plus an extra slice from my pizza), Maggi and Cheese Frankie was the the only thing you ever ate \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b. Your room was like an open theatre of knowledge. One could come in at any time of the night, and be certain to leave with a substantial amount of mathematical/philosophical knowledge \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b. \\n\\nYou helping me to my feet when I was down was the norm, whether it was the Antaragni night when I was too hungover to walk, or the galaxy finals when I twisted my ankle hobbling down the stairs in excitement. It was hurtful to see your love for S***** P remain unconfessed \xf0\x9f\x98\xa5. It goes without saying that you are one of the smartest people I\'ve met, and the most intense and profound math lover, the most surprising thing is how you achieve this with your god level last-minute decision-making skills (maybe procrastination is the solution to all our problems). Nothing can replace the awesome 4 years (minus 1 \xf0\x9f\x98\x93) I had with you.

I remember meeting you in L-20 and our friendship just hit off straight away. Pehle do saal literally class mein aapke sath hi bitayein hai. Bro you are prodigy in maths and I have never seen someone even half as good as you. Classes aur assignments mein kitne help ki hai tune meri. Yaad hai chm lab aur kvpy camp mein kitne mazze kiye tha apun ne.(Mein, tu aur dewansh toh hamesha farzi harkate karte tha experiment mein).
