You\'ve been my partner in crime in pretty much everything but I hate you for not texting me often, you better work on that. We should have made a reel together yar, but I hope we meet soon someday and then pakka we\'ll make a reel that matches your level of cringe ok :p We rarely talk about emotional stuff but I\'ll use this opportunity to say, thank you. You have been there for me (knowingly or unknowingly ) in some of my most sad times and you always managed to cheer me up. Will always remember the Abhishek Upmanyu show and the time we spend in Liquid after that, one of the best nights in those 4 years\\nI wish you all the luck to survive one more year of college without me :p\\nMiss you a lot, Love you <3 \\n\\n","author":"Priyal  Bhandari","visibility":false,"_id":"60a41b28819323d199d4808c"},{"text":"Memoir sochte hi sabse pehle ek cheez hi dimag mein aati hai lol.
