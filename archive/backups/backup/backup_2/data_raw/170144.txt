A few of the things I would change, if I could go back in time, is not hanging out with you more. Apan pehle se hi 11th mein kitne acche dost the be. 12th mein baat nahi hui but campus jab aaya to kota ke doston ke karan transition kaafi easy tha. Mainly to apan mein kabhi kuch common hua hi nahi esliye. Hall alag reh gaya and tum saalon mujhe hamesha bulate nahi jab satyam aata tha. Varna mast parties hoti be thoda plan karte uski visits to. Summers mein to mein bhi hall 12 hi ruk jaata. Fir bhi vaise mujhe lagta tha ki apan same company ya atleast city mein to jaayenge hi ki tu probably mera roommate hoga. Shayad not for now but it\xe2\x80\x99s a small world may be future mein kabhi. Fir se Akshat ko prank call karenge. Prank to kya hi, Jay banke hi kiya tha vo pehchana nahi. Last etna hi kahunga ki tu probably un doston mein se hai jisko shayad mein 10 saal baad bhi call karunga kuch kaam pada to. Not of course kyonki mein etna selfish hun :) but tu etna reliable lagta hai. Milenge yaar kabhi to.
