You were among the most hardworking members of our team.  Our entire third and fourth sem were entirely devoted to ERA.  We used to discuss the updates in the challenge even during EE250, EE210 lectures. We had jointly explored the area of reinforcement learning (although we did not use RL in the final submission).  We also shared many jokes together. Do you remember my vision for \\"Umbrella Organization\\"?\\n\\nI was expecting you to apply for team-head in third year.  Anyways, neither of us pursued robotics after the third year. Our areas of interest are quite different now. Hope that you will stay in touch.
