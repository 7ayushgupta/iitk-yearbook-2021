Uss samay mera inspiration to tha! jitna shiddat se tu TA ka kaam krta tha and jitne dedication se tu padhta tha, it made me realise that If I wanted to achieve something, I\'ll have to work hard for it! But what was even more admirable was the way you always stuck by your principles right until the end. Final kuch samay ke liye bhi tu college nhi aaya, iske liye dher sari gaaliyan dene ka mann toh kiya; but thoda sa dil main relief bhi tha kyunki chaar saal baad bhi Somu remained the Somu we all knew and loved. \\n\\nIss baar maaf toh krdiya hai but next time koi excuses nhi challenge :P .
