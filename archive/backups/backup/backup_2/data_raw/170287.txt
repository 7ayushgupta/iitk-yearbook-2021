You have managed to continue on that trajectory even at UG, and I am sure you will continue it even further along in your professional life.\\n\\nWe didn\'t have a lot of interaction in Kota but have great memories from the place, and I share that nostalgia with you. We started Undergrad with a freshers dance performance and maannn that was epic. Maybe people don\'t notice it often, but you can make people laugh and have made me laugh more than anyone in this college. I love your storied be it some incidents about your wing, Subhajit Sir, almost dying while river rafting or our inside jokes.\\n\\n\\nYou are really pure from heart and have always been the most innocent guy.  You always speak about whatever you are feeling. Combine that with you intelligence and that makes you one of the rarest people anyone would come across. You always somehow make time to both work your ass off acing any task that you are assigned with and enjoy yourself to the fullest. You value friendships and relations, and I hope we maintain this friendship we have forever.\\n\\n Mai aur keshav ek team and tu aur durgesh ek team she shuruwat ki thi assignments and projects karne ki and that overall group has remained the same ever since  (Ayush had a wildcard entry). \\n\\nEvery group needs a guy that leads from example and I am sure you already know it, but your are that guy in our group. Whatever task we are assigned to, you make sure that we do it super well and that\'s a quality which I think you should be proud of.  In this trip that we had, I saw how you were carrying us all. You were the one doing the hard stuff: managing our itinerary, negotiating prices, or taking care no one from our group is left out.  Let\'s make sure we have many more trips in the future.\\n\\nI am indebted to IITK (and Kota ) for giving me the opportunity to meet people like you.
