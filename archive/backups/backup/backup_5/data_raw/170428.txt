I heard ki there\'s a girl who has become the Volley girl\'s team captain. I was like respect++. I expected a lot from you, there and then. I imagined you to be a perfect leader as well as top-notch performer. I thought tabhi koi 1st year mein captain bann skta hai. (Pata hai, even before coming to iitk, i thought mein itni achi football khelta hun, kya pata vahan jaake mein seedha captain hi bann jaunga. pr yahan aake pata chla ki abhi bhot kuch seekhna hai zindagi mein :p) And, fir aaya suraj. usne bataya thoda thoda about you, saal bhar. You might know hum roommates the aur dono sports mein bhi the.. baatein bhi khoob krte the practice se aake..raat raat bhar :p. Pr fir i got to know the reality... Completely disappointing(i thought in my mind). pr thoda thoda doubt fir bhi reh gya tha mann mein. Ki kya pata you might be different, maybe it\'s only the way you talk to suraj. Maybe academically, i thought we are more or less same. Toh i sometimes tried to talk to you in the department as well...but you were maybe too shy to talk to. (though it was more contrary to my expectations). I remember once, in L-4, I entered the MTH302 class from back door, saw you sitting in last row of that first section and sat next to you. Hoping maybe today we can break the ice, hoping you were more chill and cool. Pr sadly, nobody talked. Then, i stopped expecting anything from you. And by the 2nd year InterIIT, I always used to hear ki volley girls practice knre ni aati, captain khud ni aati..and many more. Fir uske baad toh, somehow I started hating you. Thinking you are just privileged, you just got captaincy by luck. Moreover you\'re spoiling the sport and setting a bad example for juniors to come. Fir toh you were like mujhe tera chehra dekhke hi gussa aata tha. Then in 3rd year, when I became the GenSec, I was like ki iss baar toh Volley girls team ko chodunga nhi...bilkul fraud nhi marne dunga. peeche hi padd jaunga. That time, you were the ex-captain and dadu was the captain. I always feared ki dadu bholi bhaali si hai..but tu use bhi bigaad degi. Then, i remember ek din notes lene ke bahane mein library mein aaya tha(probably pehli baar lib aaya hounga uss saal mein). Mera uss time bhi intention tha ki tujhe thoda tight krun ki practice vgera pe aaya kr. Pr tune uss time kuch toh aisa palat ke jawab diya tha..i remember ki voh seedha aise dil ko cheer ke nikal gya tha. Uss vakt you made it a war :p Kitne dinon tk mein pareshan raha tha ki yeh...kal ki aayi ladki..jo practice tk ni krti, usne mujhe aisa bol kaise diya :p This was just one case...which built hatred for you. pr suraj somehow thoda smjhata rehta tha mujhe ki voh pagal hai psycho hai...pr vaise achi hai. I was always like ki teri aankhon pe abhi pyaar ki patti hai..koi na bete baad mein dekhenge :p Pr chill hai...mene bhot tang kiya tumhe(volley girls) ko...meetings kr krke...pr in the end it was all worth it :) I still credit your 4th position to me :p :) Fir finally I thought ki mene tumse position niklva li aur mene badla le liya. Now, I was satisfied. ki mene tujhe fraud maarne nhi diya. XD I won XD.","author":"Jaspreet  Singh","visibility":false,"_id":"60c25e8d659165b3aa64613d"},{"text":"PART 2\\nYoYo Neha!!\\nAs you might have read my Part-1, we covered uptil the 2019 InterIIT part of the story. Then in 2020 start.. a lot happened. Both with me as well as suraj :) We both were excited with our new journeys. I was happy for Suraj, but sad as well. I was somehow convincing myself ki chlo koi ni... chill hai. Suraj ki life hai, let him destroy as he wish to XD. Pr nahi... honestly, I was a little bit taken aback when I heard from suraj ki you took the first step. This was the start of my perspective changing. As expected you were too shy to interact with us, so me and suraj decided to go to a double date :p It was a nice experience. I got to know you a little...you were sometimes a bit savage at comments. Maybe that\'s why in the library it hit me hard. Maybe that\'s how you are. Some perspective changing..Now I was atleast not sad for Suraj. Then, 2020, Covid-hit everyone came home summers aise hi nikal gyi... and fir one day...Suraj told me ki neha bhi dual krri hai. That was the point, jahan pe I had to decide. Either take things the hard way, or easy way XD Finally decided to take one more chance :p This time, I was very careful, with 0 expectations, or even worse. I somehow started talking to you. I was glad ki you were not like 2nd year. You also maybe changed a bit. Or maybe this time you had no other choice(at one point, i thought u will be just using me and ditch me at your will) :p but luckily nothing like that happened. We somehow managed to get along in our 7th semester. Though I maintained a little distance from you. Controlling myself to tell where you\'re wrong :p Then the next 8th sem was also similar... kaam tk ki hi baat krte the. No suggestions, no interventions. If you are expecting ki teri tareef aane vaali hai jld hi... toh sorry, to disappoint you. This is a real life-story :) What I realised in this past one year of spending with you professionally is that.. you\'re a bit different. You\'re not like the normal girls I\'ve met. You have a very fixed bubble around you, in which very few people are allowed. That too, upto a limit. Maybe it has something to do with your past. You sometimes are so mean and rude, jaise kahan se aagyi yeh gawaar..no manners or courtesy....but then next moment you are very generous, as if you\'re an angel god has sent to help me. You are defintely an introvert. You are very hard-working and sincere. But somehow, you don\'t get what you deserve. I strongly believe it has something to do with your attitude towards your surrounding and towards life. You\'re a very smart girl, no doubt in that. You want to tread you life\'s pathway your own way, I respect that. Many times I tried correcting you, but you gave so cold replies ki mujhe voh 2nd year vaali Neha yaad aajati hai XD. That\'s why I don\'t tell you now, if I feel there\'s something you\'re doing wrongly. I believe it\'s the responsibility of every friend, but it\'s okay. You\'re different. Our friendship is different. And yes ofc, I consider you as my friend yrr... If you\'ll ever ask for my help, I don\'t think I\'ll be able to say No to you. But your ego won\'t let you ask help from me :) Cheers buddy :) No hard feelings :) Since you asked for a honest memoir. Here it is! Also, since you have been told most of these things...pr i thought i\'d tell you everything from start. I\'d prefer to say all this over a daaru party, but I think it is highly unlikely now :) I pray for your happiness in future :) Keep working hard :) God will reward you big someday :)","author":"Jaspreet  Singh","visibility":false,"_id":"60c26d8e659165b3aa646184"},{"text":"Hello Neha!
