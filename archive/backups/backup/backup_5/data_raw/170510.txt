Kitna bacchu lag rahi thi XD\\n\\nContinue to be the cutie that you are. Inspire many of my friends to fall for you so that I could leak their names to you (jo bhi ye padh raha hai, I\'m sorry). Continue to be as kind-hearted as you are, be the brave one you are, for this helps the shit that I am, lol. Thanks to all those shitty times lately, I got to know how much you cared for me and helped me rise above my situations. You gave me strength, all the while when you were going in shitty phases. It means a lot.\\n\\nFrom knowing that you are a black box to understanding the pain that it hides with all the happiness that it derives from the walks of life, it has been an incredible journey. Am glad that Goa happened (thanks again :P). Am glad that Ajay was brave enough for the parties (thanks Dipuk for paise), lol. I got to know you better. You really are a wonderful person, don\'t let anyone else take this away from you.
