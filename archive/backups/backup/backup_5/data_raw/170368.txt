However, the variant\'s prevalence in Israel is very low and the vaccine remains highly effective.\\n\\nThe study was released on the medRxiv pre-print site on April 9 and has not been peer reviewed. It compared almost 400 people who had tested positive for COVID-19, after they received one or two doses of the vaccine, against the same number of unvaccinated patients with the disease.\\n\\nIt matched age and gender, among other characteristics.\\n\\nThe South African variant, B.1.351, was found to make up about 1% of all the COVID-19 cases across all the people studied, according to the study by Tel Aviv University and Israel\'s largest healthcare provider, Clalit.\\n\\nBut among patients who had received two doses of the vaccine, the variant\'s prevalence rate was eight times higher than those unvaccinated - 5.4% versus 0.7%.\\n\\nThis suggests the vaccine is less effective against the South African variant, compared with the original coronavirus and a variant first identified in Britain that has come to comprise nearly all COVID-19 cases in Israel, the researchers said.\\n\\nThe researchers said the study was not intended to assess overall vaccine effectiveness against any variant, since it only looked at people who had already tested positive for COVID-19, not at overall infection rates.\\n\\nSeparate real-world Israeli studies on the vaccine\'s overall effectiveness, including by Clalit, have shown the Pfizer shot to be more than 90% effective. L1N2KU3L6\\n\\n\\"We found a disproportionately higher rate of the South African variant among people vaccinated with a second dose, compared to the unvaccinated group. This means that the South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccine\'s protection,\\" said Tel Aviv University\'s Adi Stern.\\n\\nIn an update to the study posted on April 16, the researchers noted that within the group of people who received two doses, which comprised eight people, all of the B.1.351 infections occurred within a week to 13 days after the second shot. None of them tested positive for it 14 days or more after the second dose.","author":"Rajat  Chaudhary","visibility":true,"_id":"607da97bb38952bbfbc6918e"},{"text":"No love reacts to Memoirs?

The podium has a sign that reads: \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome Graduating Class of:\xe2\x80\x9d, with train-station style flipping numbers after it. BUZZWELL Welcome New Hive City graduating class of... The numbers on the podium change to 9:15. BUZZWELL (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) ...9:15. (he clears his throat) And that concludes our graduation ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries. BARRY Are we going to pick our job today? ADAM I heard it\xe2\x80\x99s just orientation. The rows of chairs change in transformer-like mechanical motion to Universal Studios type tour trams. Buzzwell walks off stage. BARRY (re: trams) Whoa, heads up! Here we go. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 6. SEQ. 125 - \xe2\x80\x9cFACTORY\xe2\x80\x9d FEMALE VOICE (V.O) Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. (in Spanish) Dejen las manos y antennas adentro del tram a todos tiempos. BARRY I wonder what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be like? ADAM A little scary. Barry shakes Adam. BARRY AND ADAM AAHHHH! The tram passes under SIGNS READING: \xe2\x80\x9cHonex: A Division of Honesco: A Part of the Hexagon Group.\xe2\x80\x9d TRUDY Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco, and a part of the Hexagon group. BARRY This is it! The Honex doors OPEN, revealing the factory. BARRY (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) Wow. TRUDY We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive where our top secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this... Trudy GRABS a TEST TUBE OF HONEY from a technician. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 7. TRUDY (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) ...soothing, sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow, you all know as... EVERYONE ON THE TRAM (in unison) H-o-n-e-y. Trudy flips the flask into the crowd, and laughs as they all scramble for it. ANGLE ON: A GIRL BEE catching the honey. ADAM (sotto) That girl was hot. BARRY (sotto) She\xe2\x80\x99s my cousin. ADAM She is? BARRY Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re all cousins. ADAM Right. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. TRUDY At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. ANGLE ON: A STUNT BEE in a HELMET getting hit with a NEWSPAPER, then a SHOE, then a FLYSWATTER. He gets up, and gives a \xe2\x80\x9cthumb\xe2\x80\x99s up\xe2\x80\x9d. The graduate bees APPLAUD. ADAM (re: stunt bee) What do you think he makes? BARRY Not enough. TRUDY And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 8. BARRY Wow, what does that do? TRUDY Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\xe2\x80\x99s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\xe2\x80\x99s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that. ADAM What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference? TRUDY And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know that bees as a species haven\xe2\x80\x99t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you\xe2\x80\x99ll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We\xe2\x80\x99ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands. The frame freezes into a snapshot. Barry looks concerned. The tram continues through 2 doors. FORM DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 175 - \xe2\x80\x9cWALKING THE HIVE\xe2\x80\x9d INT. HONEX LOBBY ANGLE ON: The log-flume photo, as Barry looks at it. ADAM Wow. That blew my mind. BARRY (annoyed) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? That\xe2\x80\x99s an insane choice to have to make. ADAM Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY But Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM Barry, why would you question anything? We\xe2\x80\x99re bees. We\xe2\x80\x99re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. They walk by a newspaper stand with A SANDWICH BOARD READING: \xe2\x80\x9cBee Goes Berserk: Stings Seven Then Self.\xe2\x80\x9d ANGLE ON: A BEE filling his car\xe2\x80\x99s gas tank from a honey pump.

BARRY Yeah but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? They stop in the middle of the street. The traffic moves perfectly around them. ADAM Like what? Give me one example. BARRY (thinks) ...I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. They walk off.

Royal Nectar Force on approach. BARRY Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, hey, those are Pollen jocks. ADAM Wow. FOUR PATROL BEES FLY in through the hive\xe2\x80\x99s giant Gothic entrance. The Patrol Bees are wearing fighter pilot helmets with black visors. ADAM (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen them this close. BARRY They know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them don\xe2\x80\x99t come back. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You\xe2\x80\x99re monsters. You\xe2\x80\x99re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. BARRY Their day\xe2\x80\x99s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can\xe2\x80\x99t just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) Look at that. That\xe2\x80\x99s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\xe2\x80\x99s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two girl bees. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 12. ADAM Those ladies? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they our cousins too? BARRY Distant, distant. ANGLE ON: TWO POLLEN JOCKS. JACKSON Look at these two. SPLITZ Couple of Hive Harrys. JACKSON Let\xe2\x80\x99s have some fun with them. The pollen jocks approach. Barry and Adam continue to talk to the girls. GIRL 1 It must be so dangerous being a pollen jock. BARRY Oh yeah, one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat, and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1 Oh my. BARRY I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can autograph that if you want. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON Little gusty out there today, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty. BUZZ You know, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY Six miles, huh? ADAM (whispering) Barry. BUZZ It\xe2\x80\x99s a puddle-jump for us. But maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re not up for it. BARRY Maybe I am. ADAM (whispering louder) You are not! BUZZ We\xe2\x80\x99re going, oh-nine hundred at JGate. ADAM (re: j-gate) Whoa. BUZZ (leaning in, on top of Barry) What do you think, Buzzy Boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY I might be. It all depends on what oh-nine hundred means.

BARRY Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? MARTIN BENSON Son, let me tell you something about stirring.

BARRY You know dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn\xe2\x80\x99t right for me. MARTIN BENSON And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That\xe2\x80\x99s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 15. BARRY Well no... MARTIN BENSON Janet, your son\xe2\x80\x99s not sure he wants to go into honey.

BARRY So, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re quite a tennis player. I\xe2\x80\x99m not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. KEN That\xe2\x80\x99s where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that \xe2\x80\x9ceating with chopsticks\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud out. KEN That\xe2\x80\x99s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table knife up. It slips out of his hand. He goes under the table to pick it up. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 80. VANESSA Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Ken hits his head on the table. BARRY I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go drain the old stinger. KEN Yeah, you do that. Barry EXITS to the bathroom, grabbing a small piece of a VARIETY MAGAZINE on the way. BARRY Oh, look at that. Ken slams the champagne down on the table. Ken closes his eyes and buries his face in his hands. He grabs a magazine on the way into the bathroom.

KEN (CONT\'D) I think something stinks in here. He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower, pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank.

Ken looks down at Barry. KEN (CONT\'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You\xe2\x80\x99re bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he\xe2\x80\x99s surfing. Some water splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf\xe2\x80\x99s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing? KEN You know what? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even like honey! I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat it! VANESSA We need to talk! \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 83. She pulls Ken out by his ear.

Talking bees, no yogurt night...my nerves are fried from riding on this emotional rollercoaster. VANESSA Goodbye, Ken. KEN Augh! VANESSA Whew! Ken EXITS, then re-enters frame. KEN And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners, made by man! He EXITS again. The DOOR SLAMS behind him. VANESSA (to Barry) I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about all that. Ken RE-ENTERS. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 84. KEN I know it\xe2\x80\x99s got an aftertaste! I like it! BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.

GAMMIL (whispering) Layton, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to weave some magic with this jury, or it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be all over. Montgomery is holding a BOOK, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Secret Life of Bees\xe2\x80\x9d. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry Mr. Gammil.

MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) Mr. Benson Bee. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you what I think we\xe2\x80\x99d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We\xe2\x80\x99re friends.

ANGLE ON: Barry\xe2\x80\x99s parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry\xe2\x80\x99s parents. MONTGOMERY You\xe2\x80\x99re an illegitimate bee, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you Benson? ADAM He\xe2\x80\x99s denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They\xe2\x80\x99re agitated.

The important thing is you\xe2\x80\x99re alive. You could have died. ADAM I\xe2\x80\x99d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\xe2\x80\x99re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels.

We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke. Bees don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\xe2\x80\x99s it! That\xe2\x80\x99s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\xe2\x80\x99s not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can.

Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don\xe2\x80\x99t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\xe2\x80\x99t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\xe2\x80\x99s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He\xe2\x80\x99s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT\'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s motion. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\xe2\x80\x99t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper\'s SMOKER onto the judge\xe2\x80\x99s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It\xe2\x80\x99s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \\"Smoking or Non?\\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery\'s racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He\'s playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\xe2\x80\x99s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \\"Free the bees\\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a \xe2\x80\x9chigh 5\xe2\x80\x9d. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5\xe2\x80\x99s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT\'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You\xe2\x80\x99ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98deer in headlights\xe2\x80\x99 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We\xe2\x80\x99ve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - \xe2\x80\x9cHONEY ROUNDUP\xe2\x80\x9d EXT.
