We\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way from only meeting on our way to the washrooms to finally moving in together (definitely the next best step for us). Although we didn\xe2\x80\x99t interact much in the first year, we had one memorable conversation, and that was my first impression of you - a pretty chill person and, in hindsight, someone who knows what you really need even if that\xe2\x80\x99s not what you asked for XD. Changing my branch to EE will always be one of the best life decisions I ever make. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how different IITK would have been without you. We opened up beyond academics by randomly talking about first-year incidents, discovering how similarly we felt about those, and since then, we have discussed everything and everyone. \\n\\nIt was almost a ritual, coming to your room every time I woke up at noon and feeling so great when you were not up either lol (\xe2\x80\x9cLunch ke baad CCD ya RM chalna hai kya?\xe2\x80\x9d). The only good thing about EE was that we spent so much of our day together. Taking turns at getting frustrated with the stupid experiments, your witty answers to why we were almost thirty minutes late to the lab, figuring out the entire syllabus a day before the exam (or deciding to go to the canteen instead) - EE would have scarred me for life if it were not for you.\\n\\nWe have SO MANY unforgettable memories. All the late-night walks, the rooftops, the sudden realizations you had in my room, the night outs, the scooty (and horse) rides, and countless others. You\xe2\x80\x99re obviously an easy person to talk to, given the amount of bullshit I have thrown your way. I could always rely on you - somehow, I think you have the power to fix everything. I can be a cagey person, but I will always (eventually XD) tell you everything.\\n\\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy to find people who you just fit with, which makes me so glad that we met pretty early and I got to experience IITK with you. Even at the busiest times, every time I stopped by your room, we would mostly end up talking for hours. Of course, we complained about how much pending work we had, but now, I think this was a far more productive use of our time XD. You\xe2\x80\x99re one of the most important people in my life, someone whose opinion I value very highly and whom I\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to before anyone else. And it so comforting to know that I\xe2\x80\x99ll always have such an amazing person in my corner.\\n\\nI will miss being able to just roll out of bed and knock on your door (sorry for the rare interruptions, though). But I know, even if we get busy with our lives outside IITK, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still find the time to catch up (I know how invested you are in my life XD), gossip about the most random stuff, and support each other.

Writing this memoir brings back a rush of memories, and I can\'t decide whether to be happy about having shared them or be sad that our journey at IITK is coming to an end. It almost makes me want to just be quiet, with a sly smile on my face while my mind churns at a hundred memories per minute. But I won\'t do that, for you\'ve made me see otherwise. We\'ve been friends for a long time now, so much so that we can\'t even remember how and where we started. It feels like you just eased into my life at some point and have been an essential cog in it ever since, and I find that fitting. Although our friendship has had its fair share of explosive moments, the experiences I cherish the most are the seamless conversations where your thoughts fit in perfect harmony with mine, where filters on my thoughts did not seem necessary for the first time in my life, where I helplessly ended up laying myself bare, and where I finally learnt to value myself as a person. The surge of emotions I\'ve felt with you is something exceptional, from a sudden rush of heartbeat when we shared secrets I did not think my tongue would ever taste, to heartwrenching lulls when we reached an impasse. No experience with you was ordinary, for the connection we\'ve shared is extraordinary. I may have already expressed my appreciation, but lest the future-you forget, you\'re a gem of a person, perhaps the best I\'ve met in the last four years. \\n\\nIf people see a friend in you, know that they see an image of the best of us. If people have walked away during the journey, maybe they just couldn\'t keep up with your brilliant best. Perhaps they realised that they could never reciprocate your dedication as a friend, and perhaps they knew that they do not deserve you and were too afraid to admit it. Even I\'ve had difficulty coping up sometimes, wondering if I deserve someone as perfect as you, but afraid to forego what your friendship meant at the same time. I know that I haven\'t been the easiest person at all times, sometimes even exasperating myself over what I\'ve done. Our numerous fights, debates and breaks (sometimes not so little) in friendship bear testament to that. Thank you for always being the bigger person through these times, for trusting in the best of me even when my actions brought out the worst in me. Sanderson has taught me a lot about the value of trust, and in you, I\'ve seen this virtue come to life and blossom. \\n\\nYou know better than most about some of my difficult moments in IITK (and your role in it! JK), but I think it\'s essential for you to realise your role (knowing or unknowing) in helping me overcome it too. During my \'revival\' (shall we say), I\'ve often wondered how Avisha would react to a situation, and more often than not, that has landed me at the right decision, or rather, a decision I was happy with. You\'ve pushed me to be the best version of myself, and that has transformed me in ways that were unimaginable to me for the longest time, yet ways I had always yearned for. It\'s one of the greatest gifts I could\'ve asked for, helping me in my fight against the silly thoughts in the back of my head, and giving me an anchor when everything was slipping away.  I think you realise how important that has been for me, and I hope that conveys how much I value you. When people acknowledge the change I\'ve gone through, or appreciate me for being a good friend, know that I silently thank you for showing me the way.\\n\\nI realise I\'ve been droning on for a page without ever really beginning your memoir. I wanted to make it a grand gesture to thank you for everything and summarise our journey, but I realise we\'ve never really been about grand gestures. It\'s always been the small things that made you stand out among the riches of wonderful people at IITK. Your weird questions in the middle of a serious conversation [1], your cat-like sneer at my idiosyncrasies [2], your excitement about little things [3], your intimate knowledge about every nook and cranny of IITK [4], and your insistent hatred for dogs [5] coupled with how easy you make talking about the most difficult of things, your infinite patience and willingness to give second chances, a level of maturity and strength of character that well exceeds your age, the faith upon which I could share anything with you, and your commitment to trust and understanding was just what I needed in a friend. Not grand gestures, but a continuous adherence to these virtues have nurtured our friendship, and that\'s what I\'ll commemorate it with. I\'ll admit I\'ve been a bit clandestine with the memoir (neither the world nor I am ready for it yet), but I think you\'ll read between the lines (you always do). I don\'t know if I\'ve come close to do justice to what I wanted to say, but I know that our conversations have. \\n\xe9\xa3\x9b\xe3\x81\xb9\\n\\n[1] Why blood groups are the best conversation starters and the worst interrupters.\\n[2] Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.\\n[3] Why memoir pranks and people biting nails are the worst.\\n[4] Fantastic rooftops and how to reach them.\\n[5] How a public hatred can actually be hiding a secret love.","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60ccd612659165b3aa6463a7"},{"text":"Yo Avisha!!
