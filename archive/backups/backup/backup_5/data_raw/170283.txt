Delhi ki wo trip humesha yaad rhegi, but the best time would undoubtedly be the time we spent in Mumbai. I hope you remember the horse ride. But above the big things in life, I value the small things we had, especially the painting of minions which I had to complete as you were not that good a painter. And also, the little notes you used to leave for me at unexpected places. It was a new experience for me to be in a relationship and I realised that it was the thing that was missing because I got you, you completed my life in the campus. Fire department ke saath waala incidence to main kabhi nhi bhulunga, aur na hi marine drive pe wo baithna, jaha aisa laga ki waqt ruk hi jaata to achha hota. Kaafi competitive spirit hai tujhme jo lifelong maintain rakhna hai (in a healthy way *wink*). We spent a lot of time in many different places. Kabhi RM, kabhi library, kabhi GH, but the best was the skywalk, and a close second is the Earth Science building. Wo road bhi achhi hai jo library se RM tak jaati hai.

From waking up early at 6 for conditioning camp to waking me up for summer camp, you have been very diligent. I remember you calling me on my birthday last year at midnight and like I have said, it meant a lot to me. \\nBe as awesome as you are. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep in touch.

We got into a petty fight and then one walk changed everything. I have got many defining moments from being with you and learnt a lot about life. You broaden my perspective. I have had 21 birthdays till now, but no one did anything special compared to what you did, you made me feel special that day with your excellent craft skills. Delhi ki wo trip humesha yaad rhegi, but the best time would undoubtedly be the time we spent in Mumbai. I hope you remember the horse ride. But above the big things in life, I value the small things we had, especially the painting of minions which I had to complete as you were not that good a painter. And also, the little notes you used to leave for me at unexpected places. It was a new experience for me to be in a relationship and I realised that it was the thing that was missing because I got you, you completed my life in the campus. Fire department ke saath waala incidence to main kabhi nhi bhulunga, aur na hi marine drive pe wo baithna, jaha aisa laga ki waqt ruk hi jaata to achha hota. Kaafi competitive spirit hai tujhme jo lifelong maintain rakhna hai (in a healthy way *wink*). We spent a lot of time in many different places. Kabhi RM, kabhi library, kabhi GH, but the best was the skywalk, and a close second is the Earth Science building. Wo road bhi achhi hai jo library se RM tak jaati hai. I respect you for the progress you have made since the first year. Poori journey kaafi achhi rahi but I still wish we had met earlier and got more time in the campus. Call me when you want, call me when you need. ","author":"Anany  Sharma","visibility":true,"_id":"60c11c9d659165b3aa645361"},{"text":"Yo Gunjan!! Abhishek ka baap mai hi hu, ab to maan le.

Pehle to please don\'t kill me for some of the stuff I might write in this memoir, I don\'t want to be worried about knives in the night XD. I\'m so glad that I finally got to share some treasured moments with you, and you aren\'t just Anany ki bandi, or Medha ki pagal dost, or the idiot who\'s rolling on the floor when drunk (I saw that happen, you cannot deny it!) anymore. \\n\\nI feel like people who do well in IITK need to be mentally tough, but I\'ve met none as strong and resilient as you. It feels like you\'ve been fighting and rebelling most of your life, and circumstances and people haven\'t exactly been kind to you (what an understatement!). But the blazing and brave Gunjan I see coming at the end of it is someone I deeply respect, someone with an inhuman strength of character, and someone who did not let the circumstances dictate her journey. I don\'t care what people say about you (and neither should you), their careless comments do not come close to the truth. I feel like I\'ve had the privilege to experience the real you, and although it required some chipping, the gem in the oyster was that much special. And it was a privilege indeed! I truly am honoured by your trust in me, for considering me a friend worthy of those walks in the last month at IITK. \\n\\nI\'m not exactly an emotional person, but I would be lying if I didn\'t feel my eyes turn wet that afternoon. You are one of the rare few I\'ve poured a fraction of my heart to, that moment then was just too irresistible. It\'s a miracle really that I opened up so quickly, but I guess that speaks for you as a person. And that \'incident\' in Goa! I can\'t think of many who would have continued to remain friends with me, lest forgive me after that. But your response to it was a hug, and that made me feel a little better that day, for I knew I had found a friend who\'ll always be in my corner. \\n\\nI share some of your concerns too silly, we all do. But we\'re just not brave enough to voice it, just not comfortable enough in our skin. I don\'t think you\'re someone who forgets when to stop talking, rather, you\'re someone who\'ll trust a friend blindly and pour your heart out to them, and I sincerely appreciate that (as I\'m sure all your friends do). You don\'t need to filter your thoughts, or be mindful of your jokes or be wary of your actions with us. Because Gunjan, we get it, and we love you because and not despite of it. \\n\\nWell, I guess I can\'t end this memoir without thanking you for making my birthday extra special. You\'re one hell of a stalker, huh! I\'m honestly scared now, I can\'t even think of offending you, for I like my head better on my shoulder rather than rolling as a football (no, you weren\'t speaking too loudly in Mama-Mio when you were high that day XD). But I genuinely cherish all the efforts you put in for it, it goes to show how much you care for your friends, and it made the desserts extra sweet on my birthday. I guess I\'ll end with a promise then, a promise to visit you every time I\'m back in India until I change your mind and you settle in the US.\\n\\nP.S. - I\'m still waiting for that treat I was promised because I was the first person to pick your call when you got into Google, agli baar nahi mili to tere maal mei oregano mila dunga!","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60ce20cd659165b3aa64643b"}]}]'
