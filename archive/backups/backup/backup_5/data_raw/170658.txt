There are people rooting for me to recover and emerge stronger.\\nYou see the best in everything. I am not saying that you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the downfalls.

Anyone can seek guidance from you on any matter. I have learnt a lot of things from you. Being happy and calm despite difficulties tops this list. You were my home away from home. Thanks to you, I always feels that I have someone who would listen to me without any prejudices whatsoever. You are like a mentor, brother, friend everything wrapped in one.\\nChoosing you as my roommate was my best decision ever. If I can go back in time, then I would also do the same. From leaving IITK to not been able to leave IITK, I have evolved. I think I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten my confidence back without your constant support. You always had my back. You never let me face difficulties alone. You motivated whenever I was down. You corrected me whenever I made mistakes. \\nYou are multidimensional.

I have never seen anyone so confident in getting A in HSS\xf0\x9f\x98\x82. You have vast knowledge in almost everything. You are hardworking. You can do anything if you decide to put your mind to it.
