In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying \\"smoothly\\", the objects studied in discrete mathematics \xe2\x80\x93 such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic \xe2\x80\x93 do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in \\"continuous mathematics\\" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets[4] (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term \\"discrete mathematics.\\" Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\\n\\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.\\n\\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.\\n\\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.\\n\\nIn university curricula, \\"Discrete Mathematics\\" appeared in the 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at the time. The curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by ACM and MAA into a course that is basically intended to develop mathematical maturity in first-year students; therefore, it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well.Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well.At this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, not unlike precalculus in this respect.\\nmst maze aate bhai tumlogo ki spamming dekhne me, battlegrounds tourney krwate fir.","author":"Shobhit  Sachan","visibility":true,"_id":"60a65286819323d199d48e38"},{"text":"My first fren in IITK .\\nYou taught me ki never watch something based on reviews and ratings thankyou\\nwont write more tujhe presentation bhi toh dena hoga. oki bye and come back to campus at the earliest.","author":"Pratyush  Choudhary","visibility":true,"_id":"60a67032819323d199d48ff4"},{"text":"Kanpur se Kolkata aur Kolkata se Kanpur and beech mai bahut saare mutual friends.","author":"Rohin  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60a81b3e819323d199d49359"},{"text":"Waking up every Sunday to the conversation, \\n\\"Iss hafte kuch kaam kiya kya?\\"\\n\\"Nahi, tumne?\\"\\n\\"Nahi... chal mai sir ko mail karta hoon\\"\\nIt was really fun working together and abhi toh aur bhi kaafi kaam karna hai.
