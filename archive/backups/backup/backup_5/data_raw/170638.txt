You had asked me whether we need to worry if our internships in the US will be affected because of covid.   At that time, covid had just reached India and we were still traveling without any mask.  Many things changed after that week.  We had received the mail from TAMU that our internships had been rescinded.  All our plans of spending time together at TAMU were ruined. If not for covid, I am sure that we would have connected really well.   Anyways, keep in touch. Our paths will definitely cross in the future.  All the best for your future endeavors.","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":true,"_id":"60a96247819323d199d4941d"},{"text":"Heyy Sathvik bro!

I really loved that you could part of our trips and wholeheartedly enjoyed yourself with us. Sabki preconceptions hoti hai logo ko lekar meri bhi thi 1st year but man you have changed a lot, and changed for good. Bhaut maza aata hai, you always try to include yourself aur bhaut time spend kiya hai.  Badiya hai bhai ek saal toh aur hai, phirse milenge research ka sochte rhenge. Tera toh ho jaayega, mera bhi guide karva diyo :-P . Phirse trip hogi plan sab chalenge saath. The last 1.5 months were gold yaar. We really had fun. Your streamlined attitude is something I admire and learnt many things. Cricket is always better with you and your anecdotes (you know what I am talking about :-P) always makes me laugh, and thank you for always repeating that for me. All the best man, hopefully phirse milenge, campus nahi toh trip par.

Tu nhi hota toh kaise paas hote courses me xD\\nFirst year me ESC Labs me time spent kiya tha and then, 2nd year ke courses me. Remember the TA202 project? Tere dabbe pe CAD banaya tha shayad last me, bhai kya maze kiye the. I have always perceived you as the most studious, serious guy in the grp. I never was, for sure. But you have definitely inspired me in a lot of ways to focus more and shayad last tak thoda padh liye isiliye. Online sem me bhi saath me exams dena was the only fun moment I remember in the entire lockdown. I used to look up to exams to collaborate and get together to discuss stuff. Trips me bhi ultimate maze kiye hai bhai tere saath. Diu beach wali recording will remain the best. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always enjoyed your company, I know aise jyada baat nhi hoti shayd apni and I apologise for that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try better ab xD Still, spending the last days on campus with you is something I\xe2\x80\x99ll always cherish. Cricket khelna (read pehli ball pe clean bold hona xD), running jana, khana order karna, Mama Mio visits, ME627 ke assignments samjhna, MS related discussion with Utkarsh and much more. Thank you for all those moments. Looking forward to meeting you over our next trip. Till then, take care. Be cool as you are. Be smart as you are. And keep growing as you always have been.
