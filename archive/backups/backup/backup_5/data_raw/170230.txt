I used to ask people(nitesh, shrey...) about you and always tried to figure out some possibilities to steal some moments with you. You were one of the inpiration for me that I came back to that campus in those last months of my final year. Starting with chai samosa in canteen till almost daily nightouts, daily nayi nayi building dhoondhna, naye naye raston par jaakar sis guard k bolne par wapas aana, OAT m KK ka concert dekhna, ya Holi k din illegel tareeke se bahar ghoomkar aana, wapas aakr hall 13 ki canteen m khakar fir se ghoomne nikal jaana, Hall 2 se NCL ki taraf waali road par alag alag ped k naam par ladai karna,then NCL m paani peene k bhane sis guard ka ch***ya kaatna, wahan se nikalkar Helicoptor building ki chhat par jaakar uss breez ko feel karna, beech m yahi kahin IME building m poster k peeche deshbhakti dikhana, aur bahar nikalkar alag alag flowers par gyaan jhadna, Environmental bulding m fountain k paani par stone ko jump karana, RM k top floor se kanpur ko taadna, aur late raat bhootiya feeling m \\"Mere dholna sun\\" bjana, fir auditorium waale raste par pedo m alag alga insaano ki sakal dhoondhna, aage illegal tareeke se Park 67 m entry maarna,  wapas aate hue director waali road par pandey aur shrey ko race lgane k liye majboor karna, beech m tumahra hostel zaroor aayega par ye ghoomne ka silsila abhi thode hi khatam hoga, abhi to chawpati par dahi kawab bhi to khana hai, fir daaru ki planning bhi to karni hai (I really miss ki m tum logo k saath mahi pi paaya, but this isn\'t the ending) all centered around you and you only, ye sab to ek din ka chhota sa hissa hai, aise kitne hi din ham log saath m bakchodi kiye hai. How can I ever forget that sweet girl who came to meet me in my deadly quarantine(though again illegal :) ) and put a smile on my face. You are an epitome of inspiration for me. I have braged about you infront of almost everone I had known. I wanna live that life again... You made my days worthy to remember in the campus...You are the sweetest, cutest, enthusiatic, fantastic, heartful, adventuress, damn beautiful, girl I have ever met. I miss you and will always...Milte rhna, abhi to trip karna hai, daru pini hai, alumni banke wapas se campus ghoomna hai... even a lifespan will be less itni masti karni hai and what not. I\'m eager to see you again, again kanpur wapas ka aane ka motivation degree se jyada tum hi ho....I\'ll always be there for you for anything, any sort of bakchodi.... \\nsee you soon\\n\\"My College crush\\"","author":"Kuldeep  Singh","visibility":true,"_id":"60a629f0819323d199d48b65"},{"text":"\\"Woh hoola hoops jo ghuma rahi hai woh Deeksha hi hai.\\"\\n\\nThat was the moment jab pata chala ki you aren\'t just best at HSS activities but also a multi-talented person.
