I think it was the period just before the first year summer when we started knowing each other in a better way.\\nAnd after that, we stayed very close till the 4th year (all thanks to the hall change at the last moment after the quarantine period \xf0\x9f\x98\x85\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa9).\\nI still remember, you were the guy whom people used to say anything in hindi, even abusive words, and you didn\'t have any clue even as what they were saying \xf0\x9f\x98\x82. Although later, your determination to learn some hindi helped you a lot man.\\nWaise how can I forget that summer incident. When we both went to buy something from z-square and you bought a dress for your present-ex, whose payment was done by me. And I had to wait for the next 2 years to get that back, that also in installments \xf0\x9f\x98\x85.\\nWe even remembered you HTC phone, the lightest in our grp, which you were proud of \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c.\\nYou were a guy who went through many ups and downs in the life but was dedicated enough to convert that phase into a memorable opportunity. Dassa, cricket, ...\\nI liked your simplicity man and your thirst to strive for the best you can. \\nHow can I forget the TA202 end-sem exam \xf0\x9f\x98\x85. Hope you remembered \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c. Thanks for that yaar \xf0\x9f\x98\x81.\\nBtw, everyone in our grp would agree on this that you were the most irresponsible person of the group \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3. Still you used to manage the things. \\nPlaying late night badminton games, cards, going on trips with all (when you used to come late everytime \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c), long walks, your fundas, your random theories and discussion on them, ... (the list is very long). I will always remember all these yaar.\\nWe made so many plans for Bangalore yaar!!! You, me, Ashish and Prajwal. The best was the go karting.

But hope to meet soon there and execute each of our plans....\\nIn the quarantine period, you were like an angel for me \xf0\x9f\xa5\xba. Although you had to stay for one more week of quarantine which deprived you from playing holi with us \xf0\x9f\x98\x95.\\nOn the last day in the campus, it was very tough to bid farewell to you. But jo bhi ho, you taught me to stay positive in the life \xf0\x9f\x99\x8c\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb.\\n\\nNow, I think it\'s getting very long \xf0\x9f\x98\x85. So, let me wrap it up.\\nAll the best for your future bro!!! You are an achiever and a talented guys. This will remain with you for very long (maybe till the end). \\nWe will meet soon after this pandemic gets over.
