You were my closest friend at IITK and my goto person for doubts, questions, random bulla, scientific/unscientific talk, help, enlightenment, imaginative theories, jokes, depression talk, w**d, or literally anything that a human could think of. There are so many memories we have together that it is hard to recall all of them. You started off as a quiet smart guy, but soon became our teacher in every course. I vividly remember the long tiring talk you gave on Goodstein\'s Theorem in the first year which none of us quite understood but it was still so fun listening to it. The canteen and pizza hangouts were my favourite. Pepper Barbecue Medium (plus an extra slice from my pizza), Maggi and Cheese Frankie was the the only thing you ever ate \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b. Your room was like an open theatre of knowledge.
