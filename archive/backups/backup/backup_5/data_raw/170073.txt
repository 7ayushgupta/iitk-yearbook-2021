And teri cycle par kaise dande par baith ke ride of shame karte the raat me XD XD.

Although my favourite is when we inadvertently took Hemant\xe2\x80\x99s counselling session and the dinner in Liquid afterwards XD I remember in first year when you first gave me that lamp as a birthday gift even before my birthday, things like that and all your efforts you put, with the biggest smile on your face too, into your friendships are just amazing to me.
