Everyone falls in their journey, but the best have the strength to get back up and keep moving. I respect you man, because I see you bear that strength. It\'s weird because maybe it\'s an effect of reading Sanderson, but you\'re radiant with the light of Bridge 4 :). You\'re great at friendship, you know that? It\'s because you go way beyond the regular tickboxes of being a friend, and I feel like I can always rely on you. You bring a certain uniqueness (for lack of a better word) to any group, a breath of fresh air essential to complete any group. From being a frivolous bundle of energy lighting up faces to a thinker in deep thought, I\'ve seen you be it all. I sincerely appreciate you confiding in me on our Goa trip, and am honoured to have you reward me with your trust. Even Kaladin started his journey through tough times, but your similarity with him lies more to do with how he fought back to become radiant. All the best for the future!
