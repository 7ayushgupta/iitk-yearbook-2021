Vipin the way we talked when we first met, I never thought you would face the problems that you faced. Now when I think, I guess we connected the moment we met. Okay, really sorry for not understanding the gravity of the situation that u were in.  Respect for the way you came back(more on this later). Asking you to become my roommate in 2nd year, was the best decision I took. (I guess I have always been blessed...xD)\\nI used to think, that I have a lot of unnecessary drama in my life, and then I met you. I have seen you face every strange kind of problem a person could face( remember the struggle every sem during pre reg. or add drop, the laptop issue, you taking unnecessary difficult courses, and now the pg roll no.). So many experiences for a college life...xD).\\nYou have always supported me, in everything I have done, listened to all the crazy ideas and theories that just keep coming into my mind(You are a very good listener). You have given me a feeling of home, a person with whom, I have shared everything( you are very good at keeping secrets). You have scolded me whenever I have lost my path( I loved it).  You never talked when I used to meditate. You have this exceptional trait of giving everyone space to grow and express. \\nThe hard work and energy that you would put in everything was exceptional, you would just keep studying until you understand the concept. I was always in awe of the calmness that you exhibited during exams(studying at 4 am in the morning ,still trying to understand concepts instead of remembering them) , remember you once got addicted to rolls( a strange addiction i would say), you are an excellent critic of movies. Your love for suspense thriller took you to Korean movies/shows. And remember u watched korean shows in the middle of exams. Oh. those were crazy times\\nI haven\'t seen anyone grown more than you in the past 4 years. Starting from an hindi medium background, struggling to understand the lectures in 1st yer to doing a minor in English literature. Struggling to talk / interact with people in the 1st year, to your present confident self. who would give these excellent 1 liners. A person who was going to leave IITK, to the present self who is going with a dual degree. A person needing psychological help in the first year to the present self ,who can counsel anyone.\\nVipin, I know we are going to be friends for life. The way u supported me during internship time,lockdown and placement was very heartwarming. .\\nBrother, I am always there in every situation u need me. Just call/meet and yes, don\'t overthink.\\nI am never going to say goodbye to u.  I have no doubt, you are going to do great things in life. Always be your calm ,confident self. \\nLove you brother...\\nAnd yes keep calling me....\\n ","author":"Shashi  Shekhar","visibility":true,"_id":"60a3bd2d819323d199d47f5a"},{"text":"Hi Vipin,\\nThe quiet little boy in 1st year to a nice, soft-spoken, sincere, and wise counsel, ever ready with witty replies!

I used to feel like I am all alone in our department as there was no one in our wing from our department and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have many friends from our department too. But you were there always with me. \\nYou took all those crazy courses with me. We pulled through all those tough courses together. I think you were the reason why my grades started to improve from 2nd year. Looking at you I used to feel how could a person be this much determined to know about concepts. You always dig deep into the problem. The hard work and energy that you would put into everything were exceptional, you would just keep studying until you understand the concept. Never settle for less. Never tried to remember things, always wanted to know how things happened. \\nI think because of me you developed the habit of watching all those tv shows.
