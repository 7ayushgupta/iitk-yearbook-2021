Mainly to apan mein kabhi kuch common hua hi nahi esliye. Hall alag reh gaya and tum saalon mujhe hamesha bulate nahi jab satyam aata tha. Varna mast parties hoti be thoda plan karte uski visits to. Summers mein to mein bhi hall 12 hi ruk jaata. Fir bhi vaise mujhe lagta tha ki apan same company ya atleast city mein to jaayenge hi ki tu probably mera roommate hoga. Shayad not for now but it\xe2\x80\x99s a small world may be future mein kabhi. Fir se Akshat ko prank call karenge. Prank to kya hi, Jay banke hi kiya tha vo pehchana nahi.
