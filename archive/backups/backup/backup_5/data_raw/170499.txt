You were literally 50% of my campus life. Lets start from the very beginning. The day we first met, when swadha and I went for a random walk around the wing and we had a little chit chat. At that time only I was very sure that we are gonna be friends. And then eventually we started talking more and became very good friends very soon. Ofcourse we have infinite memories together. From making your braids, to random strolls, to never ending bulla, to somehow passing PHY103 even after poori raat muggne ke  baad (and ofcourse you were not studying xD), to discussing about our crushes :p, to literally getting up at 5:50 and somehow reaching the PE ground at 6 in the fear that we won\'t get the refund, to watching shady movies together, to spending that memorable night at faculty building rooftop <3 and .... ahhh not forgetting our beloved SHYAM and uski khtarnaak thookne ki shakti lol. You were always the gamemaster of our group, pta nhi kha kha se nye nye games laati hai (but still nothing matched the level of donkey xD) and its because of you that I can\'t undo things like \\"saas bahu aur sensex\\", \\"arvind desai ki ajeeb dastan\\" and pta nhi ky ky from my memory lol. Btw I am still making A se shuru hone vale ladkon ki list (although I believe we can remove the A criteria now :p). I really hope to see your korean shows one day and appreciate them. To be honest, you are a gem of a person. I have literally seen you care so much for your friends. I cannot thank you enough for listening to all my rants.
