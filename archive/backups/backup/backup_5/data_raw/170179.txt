Thanks for helping me out at the starting man, I was lucky to be paired with you in NYO, and I can\'t thank you enough for how much I learnt from you at that time. Listening to you talk about Deep Dream motivated me to make a dream of my own. I knew that you were brilliant from the winter-camp (first sem se to chaap hi raha hai, your gradient ascent learning rate is not a number), and I only expected that you would ace it in the end. Discussing ML related stuff (yeah, most of it was one way with you pouring knowledge) was super fun, and left me wanting to work more after I could close my mouth from awe. But despite being one of the most chapu people I\'ve ever met, thanks for always being available for help (CS 698 plag reacts only). Your stellar career is well matched by your humble self. We\'ll watch you climb to the top of your field, but please don\'t forget us minions at the summit(just kidding, you\'re too good of a person to do so).
