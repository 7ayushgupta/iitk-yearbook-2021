But If you get past that, you will find that actually, whatever you thought of him at first is absolutely right. (I can\'t believe how 28 ppl wrote a memoir for him, I haven\'t read them, but I am sure most of them would be contemptuous ). OK, this is all, what different people(you know them all ) asked me to write.\\n\\nNow I personally feel you are a great guy. I really envy the level of determination you have and the hard work you put into everything you do. we didn\'t interact much until the second year when you started living college life and we became neighbours.  You are the kind of friend which every parent want their kids to have. I really enjoyed the Uttarakhand trip with you but I think the Nainital trip was one where we really became good friends (In the oxygen-rich air of Rajaji national park). You really saved that trip after Piyush ruined it with his \\"Anda Maggi\\". At last, during last month at the campus, we were almost inseparable(Mess, long walks on Hall 12 roof, PE ground, Snookers, Hall 9 movies, Photoshoots) until you decided to get some corona in you. I will always cherish those days. \\n\\nI got a lot of memoirs to write so goodbye until next time. Be victorious!! \\n\\nP.S. The first paragraph of this memoir may have been a psychological trick to ensure that you never forget me.","author":"Rohit  Saini","visibility":true,"_id":"60c23476659165b3aa645b41"},{"text":"Pehle din se pure hall mai like sirf ek hi naam sunayi deta tha \\"Bakait\\".
