The only guy in my circle who might be more of a weeb. Also, fellow Fantasy novel reader.  Finally, he\'s the rare friend in my circle who realises agrees with chicken supremacy. Really helped out in my food runs during Antaragnis to hit every nonveg stall for their best offering. Even from Kathi roll it\'s less embarrasing for me to order double chicken double egg mayonaise rolls if I have a friend to support me too. Life\'s tough living amongst Bhuna onion peasants :-P. Sufficiently chaapu banda ki the next line is not really needed but still, best of luck with all future endeavours. Hope we meet again soon, at least in Japan XD.

Some really easy (sinx) and some not so much. But thanks for getting me through EE200 and some other courses too. You have always been very hardworking and an inspiration for me a lot of times. We did the GRE prep together yet you ended up scoring a lot more than me :P . You are the only person I know who feels \xe2\x80\x9cPhD ke bina life incomplete hogi\xe2\x80\x9d. So all the best for that. Thanks for helping me make pro con lists to decide my life choices and then me doing something completely different. We have had a hell lot of good memories together, from Antaragnis, to drunk nights to studying together (rather you teaching me), going to the canteen together every evening.

One of the rare persons in the campus who is always calm minded and chaapu at the same time. Bro kaise kar leta hai bina tension ke A laana!? Jab bhi baat kari hai tab tu har baar bol deta ki jo hoga ab dekha jaayega and phir end mein jaage phod hi deta course -.-. Mere saath toh kabhi aisa nhi ho paata :\\").it has been nothing but a privilege working with you during NLP and PLM (and offloading all the actual work to you and others :P). You and Soumya single handedly managed to drive the NLP project to publication for which I\'ll forever be grateful to you guys for getting my first co-authored paper out there even though the amount of effort I put in paled in comparison to yours. But bhai apna campus interaction zyadatar acads tak hi seemit reh gaya and discussions about ki college ke aage ab karna kya hai. Kaafi man thaa tere saath chill maarke hang out karne ka. But koi nhi, college mein nhi toh college ke bahar hi sahi. All the very best for your life ahead! (not that you need it in the first place :P). Stay in touch. And don\'t forget us muggles!
