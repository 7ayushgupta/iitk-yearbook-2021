You do not have any drive whatsoever to keep impressing people around you by talking and have believed in doing the work. Before that, this was something that I had only read or heard about, but with you I have seen it from my own eyes day in and day out. I proudly use you as an example while talking to anyone about what we should strive to be.\\n\\n\\nMany are humble from the outside, but you see that no one is always humble as you get to know them better. Well, I can attest to the fact that in the four years that I have been your roommate and closely worked with you on countless assignments and projects, you are humble through and through (even to the extent that I sometimes have to convince you of your caliber). \\n\\n\\nI would have never learnt as much as I did, throughout the course of my stay here, if I hadn\'t met you. Your intelligence, ability to power through any task and your downright humbleness is unmatched to anything I have ever seen. And in addition to all of this, you have always been a great friend to me and we have shared countless laughs together. So believe me when I say there is literally nothing that makes me happier than being of any importance whatsoever in your life.  I have seen you transform into a more confident, funnier and a more chill-friendly version of yourself over the undergrad and I like to believe I have had some role to play in that.\\n\\nThere ought to be kinder people at the top of the food chain, and therefore I wish all the success to you.\\n\\nI still have a lot to learn from you and will, therefore will try my level best to preserve this bond that we have.\\n\\nCheers Gawd!","author":"Snehal  Raj","visibility":true,"_id":"60a5fa7b819323d199d4888a"},{"text":"Bhai, \\nkaafi samay tak teri image mere mann me \'introverted padhaku\' wali thi - jo unconditionally help kar dega anytime I ask.
