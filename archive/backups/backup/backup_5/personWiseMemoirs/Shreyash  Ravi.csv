(Calling you aditya is out of the question ofc, if someone asked me do you know aditya I would probably say no). Ofcourse you enjoyed sharing a single bed with me you practically hijacked my bed and wouldn't budge!

 We've known each other for quite some time but we really grew close over the last 2 years. I would say lockdown might have been a blessing in disguise and helped us focus on what we really want. The udaipur trip was perfectly timed and I have so many amazing memories from it. Tbh, I know you don't regret doing cringe stuff in public, thats what makes it so thrilling and fun :) . Definitely glad to have you as one of my closest friends currently.

And it was the same shit every sem, me texting you to ask class mein kya hua and you saying 'kabhi to prof ko shakal dikha de'. 

Theres too many memories to recall all of them, the texts (albeit less than they should be), or the random ccd hangouts, or the random bakchodi. You've definitely managed to be there as well in some of my sadder moments, and thanks alottt for that. About that reel, ahem, the cringe is worth it if it is memorable :P . We'll for sure meet in the future and make that reel, and spend more quality time. Going for Upmanyu just before corona was the best decision ever. Don't forget me now that you're going away,

You've taught me many games that are short and fun at parties like password and I'll be grateful for those, but apart from the games, I'm really grateful I knew you and we could spend some parts of our lives knowing each other. 

There's too many memories with you to list all of them here, the amazing dinners, the birthdays at OATs, the parties and so on. But ofcourse I saved the best memory for the last, so here's a first person POV of it.

Me & saqib start cycling towards GH. Raaste mein we find faizan walking with the cake.
Me (in bakchodi) : Are faizan cake mujhe dede mein cycle karke pahucha dunga. 
Faizan: Sure bro? pakka na? *hands over the cake*
Me: Cycling peacefully towards gh, cake in 1 hand. Suddenly priyal ka call aata hai. Me in even more bakchodi, picks up the call with the other hand. Now I've got a cake in one hand, phone in the other, and I'm still cycling. Well, it actually worked perfectly.
