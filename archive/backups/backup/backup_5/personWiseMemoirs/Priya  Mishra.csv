0,Hey Akshay! Remember the conversation on linguistics that somehow turned into a conversation about knives (PS: I still don’t think it’s a good idea to talk about this on any first date) XD. It’s been really fun knowing you. Hope we have some other crazy chat soon! Take care and good luck with everything <3.,Priya  Mishra,True,60c65564659165b3aa6462c9,Akshay
1,Hi Anirudh! Priya here XD. I can’t thank you enough for ending my anxiety with the placement results and so glad that your news turned out to be right lol. Had a lot of fun *discussing* ENG with you. Good luck with everything ahead. And may our next chat not be a result of me interrupting your calls :P,Priya  Mishra,False,60cdf871659165b3aa646423,Anirudh Anil Ojha
2,"We started with linguistics bitching in our first sem and ended our last sem doing the same thing XD. I have had so much fun with you - all the random gossips (especially the “aesthetic appeal” discussion at 5 in the morning), your amazing stories, which sometimes made us forget about our classes, and the rooftop nights where we discovered a new (murderous? XD) side of yours. And how can I forget the Y18 orientation, how we vibed, and the interesting incidents that followed. It has been incredible knowing you, and I hope we stay in touch. After all, we UP people gotta stick together :P. Good luck with everything ahead <3. See you soon!",Priya  Mishra,True,60c8f4c2659165b3aa646305,Anshika  Verma
3,"Yo Arzoo! You are hands down, the best roommate ever. Thank you for helping with my very real emergencies during the last days; I’ve never met anyone so brave XD. You always had the solution for everything, and I have rarely seen you lose your calm and composure. It was so fun to see people guessing whether you’re under the blankets or not every time they entered our room. When everyone else would be studying for exams, you’d be on a movie marathon or going out for pizza and coke (I remember our shelf filled with empty cold drink bottles XD). Yet you aced everything! I loved sharing a room with you, you were such an amazing company. Btw, so proud that you finally learned to sleep with your lights off XD. I still owe you that treat, so I hope we meet soon. Good luck with everything ahead. You’re the best <3.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c90ee2659165b3aa646307,Arzoo
4,"Monikaaaa! I would have never survived EE without you, I partially owe my degree to you. Forever in awe of your jugaad skills. You always (quite literally) had the answer to everything. Thanks for all the support during internships. I had so much fun with you these past years and hope we meet again soon. Take care and good luck with everything. You deserve the best <3.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c66a84659165b3aa6462e0,Monika  Rathore
5,"Yo Avz! You are absolutely the sweetest person ever and I love your smile. We’ve had so much fun in our first-year. Be it gossiping in the club, sleeping between the million harmonies we had ya CPA mein fraud maarna. Tujhe kaafi bully kiya hai uss group pe. Btw, where are we on the “Aisa kuch nhi hai yaar” stance now XD. Thank you for always having food and for sneaking it into the library (or sending it to VH). 

You are the cutest Mafia God, and I am so sorry for being a total nightmare that day XD (Seriously dude, I could not keep my eyes closed, I tried!). I’m glad that we got to hang out properly in the last month, otherwise, I would have totally missed your amazing performance (that last shot really did its job, no? XD). Goodluck with everything ahead, you deserve the best. Hope to see you soon <3.

7,"Avisaaa! We’ve come a long way from only meeting on our way to the washrooms to finally moving in together (definitely the next best step for us). Although we didn’t interact much in the first year, we had one memorable conversation, and that was my first impression of you - a pretty chill person and, in hindsight, someone who knows what you really need even if that’s not what you asked for XD. Changing my branch to EE will always be one of the best life decisions I ever make. I can’t imagine how different IITK would have been without you. We opened up beyond academics by randomly talking about first-year incidents, discovering how similarly we felt about those, and since then, we have discussed everything and everyone. 

It was almost a ritual, coming to your room every time I woke up at noon and feeling so great when you were not up either lol (“Lunch ke baad CCD ya RM chalna hai kya?”). The only good thing about EE was that we spent so much of our day together. Taking turns at getting frustrated with the stupid experiments, your witty answers to why we were almost thirty minutes late to the lab, figuring out the entire syllabus a day before the exam (or deciding to go to the canteen instead) - EE would have scarred me for life if it were not for you.

We have SO MANY unforgettable memories. All the late-night walks, the rooftops, the sudden realizations you had in my room, the night outs, the scooty (and horse) rides, and countless others. You’re obviously an easy person to talk to, given the amount of bullshit I have thrown your way. I could always rely on you - somehow, I think you have the power to fix everything. I can be a cagey person, but I will always (eventually XD) tell you everything.

It’s not always easy to find people who you just fit with, which makes me so glad that we met pretty early and I got to experience IITK with you. Even at the busiest times, every time I stopped by your room, we would mostly end up talking for hours. Of course, we complained about how much pending work we had, but now, I think this was a far more productive use of our time XD. You’re one of the most important people in my life, someone whose opinion I value very highly and whom I’ll listen to before anyone else. And it so comforting to know that I’ll always have such an amazing person in my corner.

I will miss being able to just roll out of bed and knock on your door (sorry for the rare interruptions, though). But I know, even if we get busy with our lives outside IITK, we’ll still find the time to catch up (I know how invested you are in my life XD), gossip about the most random stuff, and support each other. I can’t imagine it being any other way!
Love you so much - Your “Priya like person” <3333

P.S. - If you don’t have that stapler, I’ll take the alternative now :)

TL;DR: Bro, you’re awesome. I’m gonna stalk you for eternity.",Priya  Mishra,True,60cb1a8d659165b3aa646341,Avisha
8,"The girl who can hula hoop XD (and is simply the best at it!). I had a great time partying and dancing with you, and I really wish we could have done it more. I am so gonna miss asking you “tu ghar kab jaa rhi”. Take care and good luck for everything, and keep rocking those bangs <3.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c3c539659165b3aa64626c,Deeksha  Yadav
9,"Yo roommate! You were easily the most homesick person on our floor when we first came here. I remember you being so sad during our first week, that I had to bribe you with CCD food to cheer you up. But I am happy this place grew on you (So maybe Kanpur is not that bad after all? XD). I will never forgive you for making me watch Mean Girls on my birthday. First-year was filled with you bringing me up to speed on all the events of the week and sometimes month (thanks to my amazing schedule). And yes, I vividly remember stealing those letters from OAT. I still have those pictures lol. I am glad we got to hangout again in our last sem, especially our VH expedition lol. Hopefully, our intense gossip sessions and movie nights made up for all the hardships you faced on your long trips to my room, and next time we’ll watch Cast Away for sure XD.

10,"Same city, same coaching. Yet, we only met in our third year and properly hung out during our VH trip. Thanks for all the amazing movie suggestions, and advice (“Campus jaane ke liye permission nhi, attitude chahiye hota hai” XD). You are genuinely one of the nicest people I’ve met here, bas thoda bitching karna seekh le. US jaake phir se holi khelte hai please XD. Hope to see you soon <3

11,"Let me start by saying thank you for making me apply to the first-year summer school. Running in the rain with our bags stuffed in a garbage bag, your amazing talent at asking questions even when you slept through the sessions XD, discovering that beautiful cafe - I had such a great time with you. I remember we were so excited after our first few days there, that we were crazily looking for something else to attend and I really wish we had found something. I have spent so many hours listening to your stories, each one more amazing than the others. I am so glad that you finally found your wing and that I was a part of it, especially since I got to know so much more about you over our chats in the last month. I am sure we’ll meet in US, and find a wonderful cafe to order that espresso and croissant. Good luck with everything ahead and see you soon <3.
P.S. - I did not order that sandwich!

12,"Yo Nupur! You are truly an exceptional stylist. Thanks for the amazing (and most random XD) makeover. It is one of my favorite memories from our last days on campus. I have never met anyone more immune to alarms lol. You are the only person who could sleep through those hundreds of alarms at 3 am in the night. And how can I ever forget your brilliant dance moves? You absolutely killed it. Hoping to see you soon, and maybe this time we’ll find a different cause for Ravi’s death.
P.S. - Let’s use the right shade for concealer next time XD.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c3c4f8659165b3aa64626a,Nupur  Mehra

14,"Brooooo!. CCD gossips, UC dinners (despite being broke af XD), RM nightouts, Udaipur trip, randomly playing frisbee outside L20 - It’s been so fun hanging out with you these past years. Remember your MSO phase during second-year summers? I think I’ve never seen that level of dedication in anyone XD. Hope to see you soon!

16,"Yo Somesh! Labs were a lot of fun, seeing you freak out over everything :P. I think we should have gotten more than one CCD treat for getting you through that ordeal lol.
