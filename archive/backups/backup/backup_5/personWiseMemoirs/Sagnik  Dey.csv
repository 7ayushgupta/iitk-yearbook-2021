Only campus friend jiske ghar hoke aaya hun though apne kanpur ki gang ki kahaaniya jo sunaata hai, laga nahin thaa waapis aaunga. Jab campus waapis aane ki baat hui, pehli cheez poonchta ki insurance hai ki nahin... Aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa matlab kyaa thaa but darr barkarar hai. Tarah tarah ke fraud sunne ke aaye hai tere through jo campus ke fest wagerah mei chalte. First year mei apna katva katva ke (hall CC incident hehe) achhe se kaatna seekh gaye ho doosro ka. Phir bhi ek baar bola thaa Antaragni ke musical night mei ghusva de line kaat ke but hua nahin tumse... Bariya bhai, ab to job ke liye aa hi rahe ho kharghar. Aiyo mumbai ghumaate tumko. Best of luck bhai, hamesha hi phokat ka haste raho hehe.",Sagnik  Dey,True,60c24cc4659165b3aa645eca,Ankur  Bajaj
1,"Bhai, itte saare memoir tumhaare... CS mei jaake alag duniya pahuch gaye ho. Bhula mat do humko. Linguistics buddy, ALMOST summer roomie(sorry bhai). I remember I went to you for consoling me after Your Lie in April heartbreak. CS ke ho, sahi launde ke paas hi gaya thaa. Anyways, best of luck and of course, Naruto is <3",Sagnik  Dey,True,60c24e12659165b3aa645efc,Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju

4,"Sanjay bhai, kaafi aalsi influence. Tere bharose harr assignment ka sabse lamba question chorr diya just because mann nahin thaa even though bas tepna hi thaa. Record holder for highest number of final exams with a number two toilet break :-P. Anyways, glad I had you as the low effort, decent performance friend. Kabhi Conjuring 4 dekhte jab release ho hehe.",Sagnik  Dey,False,60c1d306659165b3aa645570,Rishabh  Sanjay

Record holder for highest number of final exams with a number two toilet break :-P. The primary complaint I have with you is ki you actually like Fairy Tale... I remember you watching like 20 eps of Naruto the day before some endsem. French kiss waala story ab to bataa de bhai. Hate having to piece it together from apparently almost everyone else who seems to know a different version. Anyways, glad I had you as the low effort, decent performance friend. Kabhi Conjuring 4 dekhte jab release ho hehe.",Sagnik  Dey,True,60c1e8b6659165b3aa645650,Rishabh  Sanjay
6,"Sandy, my anime and philosophy wingie. The only guy in my circle who might be more of a weeb. Also, fellow Fantasy novel reader.  Finally, he's the rare friend in my circle who realises agrees with chicken supremacy. Really helped out in my food runs during Antaragnis to hit every nonveg stall for their best offering. Even from Kathi roll it's less embarrasing for me to order double chicken double egg mayonaise rolls if I have a friend to support me too. Life's tough living amongst Bhuna onion peasants :-P. Sufficiently chaapu banda ki the next line is not really needed but still, best of luck with all future endeavours. Hope we meet again soon, at least in Japan XD.

7,"Sparsh bro... First year mei jab teko dekha thaa, size dekhke lagaa thaa ye launda meko bully karega hehe. But kaafi chill banda nikla. First year ke baad se apne wing alag ho gaye to thoda interaction ghat gaya but bhai bhai hota hai. Ankur ki lene to tere room hi pahunchte the and tu bhi koi rok nahin lagaaya kabhi ankur ki lene mei, bas haath bataaya hai. Dalle aur mera bhi common link tu hi thaa Fifa ke baahar. Harr baar canteen mei door se tum dono meri lene aa jaate the unplanned... But as they say, wahi to din yaad aayenge. Best of luck for the future and touch me rahiyo pro badminton player!",Sagnik  Dey,True,60c2521d659165b3aa645fb7,Sparsh  Kaoshik
8,"Our first interaction I remember is you being the unknown guy who fetched my towel to the shower when I went in without it. I decided then ki ye sahi launda hai. Kaafi galat thaa. Anyways, gamers ki kaafi kami thi campus mei. Hopefully tu mil gaya. Let's not mention FIFA... Man R6siege mei 2 v 5 matches are some of my best memories from campus. You were my gateway to military grade firecrackers. CCD companion when everybody else would cheap out. Guy who probably likes non veg as much as me but can't eat hehe. Never forget Nepali and BakchodSuperCollider. College definitely wouldn't be the same without you. Of course, I can't really mention our more ""cultured"" discussions. Best of luck and keep in touch.  ",Sagnik  Dey,True,60c1dab3659165b3aa6455ca,Sudhanshu  Mishra
