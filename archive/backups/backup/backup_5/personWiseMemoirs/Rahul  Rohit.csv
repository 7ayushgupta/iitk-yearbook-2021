0,"Aman bhai, I consider myself extremely lucky I had you as my first roommate. I can genuinely say ki you are the most pure, humble, innocent and down to earth person I met on campus. Campus ki first morning m apan 2 nikle the chote se walk pe, shaayad teko yaad nahi hoga but aise hi kaafi cheezein h jo first time tere saath hi kari h campus mein. Badminton, squash aur finance mein tu gawd ban gaya, but pubg mein noob reh gaya lol. Witnessed your sheer dedication towards E-cell and common mba and eco courses mein kaafi help kari tune...aise hi life mein chaapte raho, wish you the very best. Stay cheerful always!
Aur haan, light band karke main phone pe padhta nahi tha xD. Milte rahenge aage, tab tak pubg aa hi raha h, usme milo beta pelta hu",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5b600819323d199d4876c,Aman  Jangid
1,"Ambani ji, aapki raeesi ke kisse toh poore campus mein famous hain. But only your true friends know that a major part of your wealth is spent on liquid handwash (kitna dhoega bro, bas ab ruk jaa xD). A very calm person and extremely accommodating roommate, always grateful for your late night coffees and tea. Goa ka mishap toh nahi bhul paunga, but hope you realized your true capacity lol. Netflix ke liye toh can't thank you enough. Kaafi lazy h tu tbh, but senate elections and e-cell head nomination ke time teri dedication bhi dekh li. Valorant mein sova gawd Sinhatra, dont rely on lineups alone lol. Take care and stay in touch brother!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c10c94659165b3aa645310,Anant  Sinha
2,"Ananta bhai, you are probably the most sincere-towards-acads person I met on campus. You have an exemplary work ethic and a strive to learn, jisne na jaane kitno ke MTH courses bachaye h first year mein. Apne C6 mein probably tere ""earnest request"" ke wajah se hi ""academic environment"" maintained tha lol. 
A true diehard cricket fanatic and probably the most devoted KKR fan there is, I will never forget our cricket discussions on the mess table. First year mein double dasse ke baad we got to meet the true you, a party animal with a larger-than-life personality. Please never ever change that... all the very best for ahead, you are bound to go places.
P.S. first sem ke aeromodelling workshop mein selfie contest ke naam pe jo fraud maara tha tumne, kbahi nahi bhulunga lmao. Cheers buddy.",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5b26d819323d199d48767,Ananta  Mukherjee
3,"Jab tune first year ke aeromodelling workshop mein fraud maara tha, to garner likes on a stupid selfie contest, mujhe ummeed nahi thi ki tu 1 din GS pahuch jayega xD. Probably the most active and social person in our wing, you were almost always the initiator of our wing plans. Most trips couldn't manage to see the light of the day, but our Lucknow and Goa trips are etched in memories forever. Started with loco, pubg, moved on to mafia, poker, skribbl, and finally 28 and judgement, your involvement in these games was a given. I am very proud you started watching The Office and football games (because of me xD). And tera legendary ""TOH?!"" toh yaad hi h sabko lol.
Aage bhi chaapte reh, hasste reh and sabko Gujarati farsaan khilaate reh. Also, aage ki trips bhi tu hi plan kar ra. Cheers mate, stay in touch!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5bb68819323d199d4876f,Anuj Mayurkumar Shah
4,"Archit boi! 11-12 same coaching same batch, IITK same branch, same hall, same wing, after IITK same company: bc kab peecha chhodoge xD. From my most fb mutuals to my most linkedin mutuals, our friendship has come a long way. U r probably the guy with whom i share the most with, good stuff, embarrassing stuff, all of it. and i wish that day would come when u do the same with me lol. Baaki zyada load mat le, u mostly have everything figured out, but kabhi hume bhi guide kar diya karo. Tere room pe jo party kari thi, abhi bhi yaad h. Saath mein kitne hi courses mein fraud maara h, game theory still remains my favorite though ;) Agli trip mein try kar sirf airport pe nahi, poori trip pe saath ho. Pubgm mein emulator pe chaapne ke baad bhi valorant mein kaafi noob h tu, koi nahi i'll carry you. And how can I forget our NSS ordeal, boi was it frustrating but we made it through (in 2 attempts lol). Wish you returned to campus in the last, but koi nahi, bangalore aur hyd utne door nahi. All the very best ahead, aise hi chaapte raho and stay in touch brother!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c1fac5659165b3aa645726,Archit  Awasthi
5,"Jhunjhun bhai, eco101 se shuruat hui aur aaj valo tak chal ri, you have been a true friend throughout. Your harlem shake move of rubbing an umbrella on your body was the most random but perhaps the most funny as well. Teri bargaining skills toh no one can match, 1000 ke slippers 200 mein, 22k ka phone 9k mein, the list is endless. Corridors mein tu saanp ki tarah logon ke beech se chalta tha, yaad h meko. Electronics ki choice thoda improve kar, cooler almost hair-dryer jaisa tha, laptop ki screen alag ho gayi, headphones kharaab ho gaye, wonder where those hours of research go. Watched so many e-sports tourneys together, from fortnite to pubgm to valorant. Perhaps only your closest friends know this, but tere liye the most important thing in life is SUBAH KA NASHTA, woh miss nahi hona chahiye at any cost, bc Goa mein bhi u had to have a full breakfast every morning. I hope one day tere 5000 fortnite hours pay dividends in valorant as well, tab tak chill maar, I'll carry with an odin. All the very best for ahead and stay in touch brother!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c156c1659165b3aa6453ff,Arpit Kumar Jhunjhunwala
6,"Atul bhai, Kota mein same batch se le ke Kanpur mein same department tak, you have been a true friend. Yaad hai first year mein tune mera chm101 lab manual kho diya tha lol, raat ko waapis gaye the dhundne. Aise hi chaapte raho aage and stay in touch brother!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c12143659165b3aa645377,Atul  Kumar
7,"Deepak bhai, mains topper...kaise ho? Kota mein you used to be the quiet one among me, Harshit and others, always deep into your books...but yahan aake kya hi famous hue _/\_ (yes, probably all the fb spamming to be blamed) Wish we hung out more, but time kahan hota tha aapke paas xD. Koi nahi, aage let's try to better this. And thanks for lending me your blazer (it was probably a tuxedo lol) in the last days. Aage bhi chaapte raho and stay in touch brother! Peace out!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c24044659165b3aa645c9b,Mahajan Dipak Anil
8,"One of the most mature and composed guys I met on campus, very sincere and dedicated towards his goals and knows how to party hard when the time comes. A very talented dancer too, who knew lol. Last mein jo tune poori wing ko steps sikhaaye hain, hope ki aage kabhi kaam aa jaaye. DS aur derivatives jaise kuch course bhi kare h apan ne saath, thanks for all the help. Goa trip toh memorable hai hi. Congrats on GS and aise hi aage bhi chaapte raho, best wishes, stay in touch! P.S. no one can beat your signature camera pose (kneeling down, hands on ur shades, fake candid lol)",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c1538a659165b3aa6453f8,Nimish  Agarwal
9,"Raghav bhai, apan ne kitne hi courses mein saath fraud maara h, class ke liye nikalte the aur raaste mein manoj ke room pe patte bich jaate the lol. Exams ke pehle saath night-outs, canteen mess mein saath, tere speaker pe kitne hi matches aur movies dekhe h. Lucknow and Goa trips were unforgettable,  also you made us click an annoyingly large number of photos of yourself but chill h, teri achi aati h <3. Crypto ke gyaan ke liye thanks, hope one day tere jaise profits ho mere bhi. You are a true friend and an amazing human. Stay in touch brother!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c10826659165b3aa6452f2,Raghav  Singh
10,"Raju bhai, my partner in late night kathi roll orders. Acads mein inta chill maara aur placements mein day 0 chaap diya, kaise chaap lete ho sir itna? First year mein b6 ki ragging le thi tune yaad h abhi bhi lol, aur anuj se teri ladai lmao. A genuinely funny dude who knows how to chill out and still get things done. Saath mein kaafi pc games try kare hain but valorant pehla h jisme tik paa re, aise hi continue karna h. Aimlabs 60k ka faayda abhi currently toh nahi dikh ra in game but I hope aage dikhe, tab tak chill maar main karta hu carry (odin se xD). Your floss dance move is crazy good. Take care bro and stay connected!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c10add659165b3aa645303,Raj  Kumar
11,"Yo meme lord _/\_ my dominoes partner forever, iim ne kaafi bada aadmi bana diya h teko but we knew your talents from the very start lol. Poori wing mein tere chillaane ki awaz aati rehti thi din raat. Still remember the time you forgot to stop the water while filling Umang's cooler and poora wing flood ho gaya tha lol. Pubg pro toh tu tha hi but valorant mein noob reh gaya. Aise hi hassta reh and hasaata reh, hope to meet you soon again. Until then, take care and stay cheerful! All d very best buddy!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c24486659165b3aa645d65,Shobhit  Sachan
12,"Yo Shreyash bhai! Kota se saath ho, wish we hung out more when in campus, but whenever we did, it was fun (except for that one time when you forced us into playing Terraforming Mars, pretended to enjoy it given u were the CBG coordie, but ngl it was rather boring xD) Still remember the page-long family tree u drew while explaining me GoT; its a shame you managed to retain more details than the actual producers did in the last season lol. Probably the only one in campus I know of who slept and missed a midsem xD. Hostel mein when u claimed of sleeping as the reason for not answering ur door, i never believed you, but ok now i do. Tere chats were always the most detailed and philosophical. I credit you mostly for hooking me onto english shows and movies (probably a bit too much :( ). But I never understood, movies toh bc saare saath dekhte h toh tere marks kaise aa jaate sahi (probably ur ""grand master plan"" lol). 100pi lautane mein kaafi time lagaya tune, but koi nahi aage bhi waisi hi parties karni h. Milte rahenge aage bhi, all the very best for life (I believe the trick for u to excel in life is to treat everything like a maths class test xD) Take care!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c23ebb659165b3aa645c61,Shreyash  Ravi
13,"Sunit boi!!! hardly met anyone more sincere, dedicated and hard working than you. Football aur TT mein tum pro the hi, bc last mein poker mein bhi jeetne lage the (uske winnings milenge nahi btw kabhi xD). WIng repie ke elections mein maine teko hi vote kara tha, though u narrowly lost. You are probably the most mature one in the wing who can be trsuted upon to handle any situation calmly (goa mein sinha wale mishap mein dekh hi liya tha) But woh gaadi ke owner ko kya bhadkaaya tha tune lol xD. Still remember leaving pubg midgame to go shoot ur stupid mech ka assignment. Hope to meet u again soon, till then take care and stay cheerful! All the best buddy! ",Rahul  Rohit,True,60c2434f659165b3aa645d30,Sunit  Gautam
14,"Clean coder Umang Malik, others might know as the chaapu CSE guy, but for me you were the one who failed to install Linux on my laptop like 7 times xD. Jokes aside, a genuine, helpful, no-nonsense guy with a slight scope of improvement in the bulla department, not all days need to be super productive lol. Thanks for your answers during Loco times. Saath mein kaafi FPS games mein suffer kara hai, pubg lite, RoE, Apex and probably more. But finally valorant mein chaap rahe hain, though I miss your duelist MVP days. Also you had the most epic (and unique/unfortunate iykwim) GPL in first year lmao. Aage bhi chaapte raho, all the best and stay in touch bhai!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a63ef4819323d199d48cb1,Umang  Malik
