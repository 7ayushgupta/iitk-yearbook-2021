Day 1 se kattne waale din tu mujhse zyada BT me na hota toh shayad mai khud ko sambhal na pata (jabtak sambhala tab tak bhi). Wahan se leke OS and ECO201, sab me kaafi help ki hai. Thoroughly enjoyed all the deep and shallow discussions we've had. TT ho ya other sorts of comparisions, sab me tu mujhe close competition de ke haara hai and I appreciate your efforts. Last month me bhi apan kaafi maze kar paaye ye badhiya baat hai, lekin saath me peena abhi baaki hai dost.
Tere saath one-upmanship toh chalti rahegi, milte hain hopefully.",Anirudh Anil Ojha,True,60cb4f98659165b3aa646347,Abhishek  Bhatia
1,"Campus ke last weekend C-Bot me ghumte hue hamare kadam tere khaali room ki taraf chale gaye. Ram, Anany aur mai saath me bole - ""BT ho gyi yaar.""

Pre-covid times ki last raat jahan chodi thi, laut ke wahin se shuru ki. Tere jaane ke baad parties me vo feel rahi hi nhi. Thanks for being a bridge for me to amazing times with the Hall 2 gang. I don't think my campus experience the last month would have been half of what it was, without you. Everyone knows you as the party-maker, but individual seshs with you have always given me a glimpse of something with a desire to be much deeper. Love your vibe, your playlists and your attitude towards life. Buy that bartender kit soon. Badminton me aur face-offs karte hain but I think mai ma chod dunga.

One of the rare honest people, and one who stands by his morals (which are sometimes controversial). Politics, poetry and human nature ki bhi kaafi sahi samajh hai.

Saale PE ke fraudy, Evangelion ke chode, Chemical Engineer, bangali. Thodi gaand kum kar nhi toh belt pehen. Black coffee ki aadat laga di mujhe, while Hedeir and Simmel turned in their graves. Pehli baar gaanja bhi phunkwa dia. TA ke liye kya mage the Yasharth ke saath, maza aagya tha. Machine learning karte karte ye kahan maths karne laga, chup chaap neural network chala madharchod.

7,"Anish the CHaapu.
From Orientation to ECO101 to winter camp to OS to Hall 12 we go long back brother, and thou shalt always have a friend in me. Loved your transition from the short haired ex-head boy to the long haired hatted ascetic. I remember winter camp me ek baar tu snapchat pe kisi bandi se batiya rha tha and we dragged you out for a nightout across campus. Amazing decision. Uss raat bhand ho ke shayad tu hi bola tha ""g**nd me trishul maar dunga"".
Biryani by Kilo and reels during campus were some of the best times.

We did meet over dinner and I am surprised how smooth it was. I am even more surprised by the fact that I had called you to help deal with my break-up. It speaks to you being an insightful and perceptive conversationalist. Do hit me up if we are in proximity.
Please Feni waali video bhej de, I am sure I was looking nice in it.

You're one of the coolest people I know, your loads of esoteric knowledge on history and whatnot has always impressed me.

Perhaps it is these similarities which has caused friction between us sometimes, but that also makes you special.
Learnt a lot from you since our time in CFD, with the advice regarding ideal time into a relationship to have sex being the highlight. The debates (featuring Dandi) over religion, virtue and vice were always appreciated. Loved your transition from a self-proclaimed God-fearing Marwari to a paragon of nashe on campus.
