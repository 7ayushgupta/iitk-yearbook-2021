Genius is an understatement for you. Yet you are SO HUMBLE. And so straightforward. Project report ka draft padhke muh pe bol diye the tum ki ""bhai bahut kharab likha hai"". Loved the fact that you are so honest. No bullshit, straight to the point. Plus, you helped me so much ! CS640 me pehli baar samajh me aaya ki efficient group-work hota kya hai. You are a natural leader. You inspire me to work harder.

Bruh I could say you changed my life, but that wouldn't be the whole truth. The changes go deeper than the layers which constitute ""me"". There were so many irrelevant things I stupidly clung to with my pig-headed rationalism until you took my hand and helped me leave them behind in those cleansing hot waters (you know which one). I still remember thinking ""wtf is he talking about"" when you first unleashed all that non-duality stuff on me. I would never even have seriously taken to watching films if it weren't for you. If I made a film of all the things we did, it would be more surreal than Lynch, more outrageous than Rivette, and more spiritual than Tarkovsky. Your imprint is all over me.

And, yeah, you are THE ARTIST, bro. And not all of your art is paint and sketches - one of those artworks is a living breathing computer nerd. And may I be brash for once to say, that you (as always) have made a MASTERPIECE.",Alan  Nair,True,60997a4e819323d199d47962,Gowtham  Prakash
