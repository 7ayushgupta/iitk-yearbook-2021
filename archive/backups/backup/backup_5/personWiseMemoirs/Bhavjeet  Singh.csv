I don't know what I have done to offend you tbh, but whatever it is, sorry man.
Honestly, there are so many memories that we have that it's difficult to pick a handful of it, but let's give it a shot. The first story that comes to my mind is jab tu Varanasi gya tha :P. I was partly responsible for all the fuck ups that happened but I haven't accepted that till date and I still don't :P. I will always cherish our canteen moments, 'hatt behen ke lode' moments, 'uth canteen chal' moments, 'kuch bhi bol raha hai' moments, 'Kuldeep chutiya ho gya' moments and most of all, the silent slow dancing exits from each other's rooms with weird expressions on our faces. Bohot time spend kia hai on your room just sitting and discussing random gossips and ideas and it kills me that I couldn't relive that vaapis campus aa ke.
I know we haven't talked much since the start of the lockdown but trust me man, you are still a close friend and I am always there for you if you need me.",Bhavjeet  Singh,True,60c518d7659165b3aa6462a7,Abhishek  Sharma

Bruhh, jab tak tere se nahi mila tha, bohot kuch suna tha ki Nikunj aisa hai vaisa hai, ofc elections adding to the fuel but ek saal tere saath kaam kar ke, consult prep kar ke, bulla kaat ke one thing I am really clear about is that we are really similar to each other in a lot of respects. Chahe gossip ho, courses mein fraud maarna ho, election rivalries ho xD, kaam karne ke ideas and feel ho and a lot of other stuff. No doubt, apna thought process aligned on a lot of stuff. Tere liye respect has grown manifolds over the year and I really wish we get to hang out more. 
Senate vaali photo nahi ho paayi, iski BT toh bohot rahegi mujhe, let's do that at the first chance we get. 
Intellectuals ka annual meet plan type banate hai kuch, maza aayega.

Okay, here we go - if I go back to the point in my 2nd year, jahan I was having random conversations with a couple of people on 'Soumya Gupta kon hai', and these people telling me hai koi chutiya, pata nahi kaise ban gya photo cordi, I couldn't be happier that I met you otherwise bohot hi galat impression ke saath graduate ho jaata mai about you. Simply put, I know a handful of people who have a clean af heart.

Simply put, I know a handful of people who are such an honest friend that a person feels lucky to get him as a friend, tu unn mein se hai bsdk.
Tujhe tere lows pe bhi dekha hai (not utna but still) and highs pe bhi and still everytime I saw you, tu kisi na kisi ko hasaane mein laga rehta tha, I so want that positivity that you carry with you everywhere. Tere saath pura placement process nikaalna has been a blessing for me, quite literally the reason I came out of it sane is teri, saksham ki bakchodiyon and group pe har tarah ka chutiyap. Khud kitni bhi BT ho tu hamesha saamne vaali ki khushi/BT ko upar rakhta hai and isliye 'dwight vaala salute'. 
Tere ko mere bohot secrets pata hai saale, tu apne nahi batata bc, but I frankly didn't expect ki tu itne time tak hold karke rakhega apne paas xD. You are the closest I know to 'Captain Rogers'. Bohot BT share ki hai tere sath chats mein and khoob gyaan peli bhi ki hai, I hope tu experiment kare taaki I know if those ideas work and fir mai bhi implement kar saku.
Tu hi hai jo meri dhang ki photo kheech paaya hai aaj tak, that answers the question 'yeh photo cordi kaise bana'. Maze toh bohot lete ho tum bc mere but inhi huehue moments mein lockdown kata hai toh ab toh gussa bhi nahi aata.
Memories toh bohot saari hai, I am pretty sure inka hagga portal contain nahi kar payega toh in a nutshell to answer 'kon hai Soumya Gupta', bohot bakchod insaan ho yaar, apne aap ko chutiya kam samjha karo. 
CoD mein chutiye ho tum mere se uska toh tum kuch kar nahi sakte.",Bhavjeet  Singh,True,60c527e9659165b3aa6462ab,Soumya  Gupta

You are the most anti-me personality I have known at IITK. be it liking mechanical xD, the work ethic, positive attitude, getting things done the right way, not fucking things up, loved by all, The office lover :P and a 100 more things. 
Makes me wonder how the hell we relate so much on so many things. 
Thanks for being a saviour in all the ME courses, thanks for being in AnC, thanks for never calling me chutiya on my face, most of all, thanks for just being there when needed.",Bhavjeet  Singh,True,60a8d3b1819323d199d493c1,Suyash  Singh
6,"Bruhh! just gonna sum it up in one line - If I have to pick one person I ever met to not fuck up something major for me, be it anything, I will anyday choose you. 
Cheers to freshers drams, 2nd year summers, AnC, gymkhana, BB, goa and all the other fun and not so fun moments we had till now and will have in future :))",Bhavjeet  Singh,True,60a8c951819323d199d493b8,Yash  Maheshwari
