1,Yo Ayush! Bhai tu ekdum selfless aur generous aadmi hai. We shared a lot of good times (mostly Bhatia/Yugesh ke room pe) but I still regret not spending more time with you. I hope we can cover that in the future with our shared enthu for F1. Milte rehna!,Madhur Deep Jain,True,60abf47a659165b3aa644dbd,Ayush  Agarwal
2,"Bhavjeet paaji aapse to purana rishta hai. Apni ek choti si Aakash ki family hai IITK me xD. Bahaut hardworking aur talented hai tu, bada aadmi banega. Tere saath daaru nhi pi yr campus me. Next time me weet, BBQ chalenge jisme bar ho.",Madhur Deep Jain,True,60abf7c6659165b3aa644dc0,Bhavjeet  Singh
3,"Gowtham bro I guess we really met towards the end of college but I feel a spiritual connection with you. I will always cherish our discussions and sessions we had (particularly one on the mess roof). You have developed a curiosity for art within me. The paintings you drew on my iPad will be there forever unless I go broke and I have to sell them for huge loads of money :p
I hope to meet you again and recreate those days.",Madhur Deep Jain,True,60abf2df659165b3aa644dbc,Gowtham  Prakash

Keep doing the amazing work, tere channel se updates to milte hi rahenge. #AlwaysHallV",Madhur Deep Jain,True,60abf945659165b3aa644dc2,Rishabh  Ramola
5,"Jagga bro, apni life me kaafi similarities hai apart from your better rank and all the money that you will make :p Humne to 12th bhi saath me nikaali hai Chandigarh me, tere ghar pe bhi raha hu. Towards end of JEE, jab Aakash ne Delhi bulaya tha tab bhi saath me hi rehte the. Bas Vasu missing tha IITK life se. Ab to tu bhi GZB aa gya, milte rahenge",Madhur Deep Jain,True,60abf685659165b3aa644dbf,Shobhit  Jagga
