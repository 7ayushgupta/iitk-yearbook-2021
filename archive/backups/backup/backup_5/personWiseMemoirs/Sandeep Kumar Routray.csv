0,"Yo Nilay! First year me jyada interact nhi kiye (except jab tak me AUV me tha), tera room pura end me tha! I guess proper bonding EE courses start hone ke baad hua (remember EE200 fourier transform of sin(x) ... XD XD), and eventually that led to the EE trio (along with Sanidhya) of our wing. I would also claim credit for fixing your resume (but others have already done that), hard to believe ek time pe ye launda research enthusiast tha, but I guess you have come a long way since 5th sem where you needed Sanidhya and me to plan your life with pro-cons excel sheet. And thanks for being my GRE prep buddy during third year winters. Aur kya batao, kaafi memories he to pick from...  but if I have to choose, I would say drunk Nilay is my favourite!, remember you being  knocked off with 3/4th brocode and I completing the rest. And, I would never forgive you for making me take linguistics in last sem. Anyways, best of luck for your future endeavours and milte he kabhi yaar, it has been too long.",Sandeep Kumar Routray,True,60c1de24659165b3aa6455ec,Nilay Nilesh Shah
1,"Yo Sagnik! I guess we started interacting in first year cause our roll nos were near and we were close by in most of our labs. That and probably our mutual love for chicken, which has helped out through fests. I would always claim credit for introducing you to anime, and now you have surpassed me in that area loll! I think I was probably more appalled than you when you came to MTH in second year, that's a story in itself! That and many other instances over the years, would make you as a guy in my mind who remains true to his nature, and not being afraid to take the unorthodox decision.  Remember, how you became the guy who, despite willing to avoid development stuffs, always managed to do more of it! I think we bonded over our mutual interests and life views, and penchant for geekiness. And slowly I also came to know that devilish mind hiding behind an innocent facade!  Anyways, best of luck for your future endeavors and I would hold you to that Japan trip in December!",Sandeep Kumar Routray,True,60c1e560659165b3aa645638,Sagnik  Dey
2,"Aur bhai Jindal!! Before 4th sem, we goofed about together, you being always available when called for chai! If Nilay and Sanidhya were the ones jinke saath batti wale kaam kiya, you are the one  jiske saath wo kaam kiya jo eventually decided both of your careers. Remember how a spur of the moment decision during add-drop in 4th sem that went on to decide our career loll! Summers me saath me SURGE kiye aur hardcore computer vision enthusiast ban gye and fir uske baad UGP in 5th sem (though still could not get publication). I think Hyderabad wala summer school trip was one of our best memories together. Btw, we never went to sir to get refunds for that XD XD. I still regret not being able to join you in the deep end of the pool! You introduced me to the art of drinking that summer too, so thanks for that. Aur kya bataon, you seemed you have mastered the art of chaapna in an easy-going manner while still managing to have shit load of fun in the way. Wish you best in all aspects of your life ahead and see you soon. And ha America jake bhul mat jaana!",Sandeep Kumar Routray,True,60c2540b659165b3aa646016,Vaibhav  Jindal
