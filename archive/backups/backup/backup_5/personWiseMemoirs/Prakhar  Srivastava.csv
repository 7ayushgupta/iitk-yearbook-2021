Milte to humlog haar hi din the ... itne courses jo saath mai kiyee haii and exams ke baad disscuss krne ke liyee daat bhi itni khaayi haii. It was fun to roam around with you during antargini which turned out to be last antaragini 🥲. I could talk to you about anything freely and I miss those times which ended so abruptly. Slowly and gradually our friendship became stronger ❤️. I always looked for a empty seat near you in class kyuki padha toh jata nhi tha mujhse 😆.You have always been so caring and supportive and sweet and smart lol you are everything that's good 😬. I hate that you didn't came during the last months, there are still many unfinished plans and places to go and hopefully we can do them in the future. Aur kabhi humlog ko bhi apne haath kaa bnna hua tasy khana khilaao itni photos bhej ke jealous krti rheti ho baaaas .... And don't worry agle ek saal taak humlog tumhe feel nhi hone denge ki tum graduate ho chuki hoo 😁",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60c5a4fc659165b3aa6462b1,Abha  Tamrakar

I remember our first talk in school after mso olympiad which I know you surely don't . Itne shaitaan hua krte the tum school mai ab toh kaafi sudhar gye ho. And the section change in 8th class is the best thing that happened like ever if now I think about it. JIO aane se itne saal phele hi phone pe ghanto laage rhete the hum dono(atleast padhai ko leke hi 🤣). Itni jayda pen fights and gossips. And mere upaar base(NaOH) girane ke liye shukriyaa abhi taak nishaan pdaa hua haii 😑.  I am so sorry for not being sorry that I revealed your secret so early (not able to resist 😶).
Chlo atleast tumhe aakhri aate aate taak iitk mil hi gyaa wrna isse aage kya hi likhta maii. Itni masti , nautanki and irritate mai sayaad hi kisi se huaa hungaa. Itne nighouts, games aur ghoomaa hai humlog nee that you became a important part of my life. Chlo accha hua jabardasti photo keechte rhete the tum ki finally mujhe adadt ho gyii. Itna jaldi mat gussa hua krro be and hopefully humlog kaafi trips mai jaayengee aaage and jitne maaje kiye hai usse jayda hi krrengee and mehnat krte rhena aur aage badte rheenaa 😬😬",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60a539ea819323d199d4841a,Saransh  Nadda

7,"Yo Nupur ....... I remember I always wanted to talk to you since the day I saw you but was too shy to do so ☹️☹️.  Fortunately we were both in Udgosh where we first talked in events ground I guess 😬. And more fortunately that you were in chemical where we spent most of the time in labs. In TA we just roam in the lab and talk ,in ESO we just used to sit and talk and in UOP do some work and talk 🤣🤣. Being in the same group and talking with you was always constant and I am so much glad it was you😁. You were always so sweet and fun❤️. I don't know if we learned to drill metals but we definitely learned to drill chalks and pencils.

The little talks before/during/after the classes and 3hr long talks in the labs were always soo much fun . You are a combination of brillance and elegance and I am sooo glad I got to spent so much time with you😍. I was always able to talk to you in any situation and I hope we keep talking. You already have a great future ahead and I know you will excel at anything you want . Just waiting for this idiotic covid to end and then we can meet very sooon 😬😬.",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60be4554659165b3aa64505a,Nupur  Mehra

9,"Lol I think I knew you way before you came to know me owing to some unethical means 😂😂 and I was always feeling like a little detective which made Sarah life troublesome i guess 😬, I know we saw each other many times in the coaching but our first talk was after jee advanced in a messenger group aur jaise humlog ne baat krna chalu ki lag hi nhi rha thaa ki pheli baar baat krr rhe haii .... and utni jaldi hi humari ladiyaan bhi hoti thii jisme obv mai shi hota tha 😏 .... nevertheless I am happy those fights never affected us in the long run ...... jab bhi bore ya dhukhi hotaa thaa toh tum dono mili hi jaate the. Humlog ne itni baate ki hai ki now  it seems you know all the important bits of my life. Har do-teen haafto mai toh resturants pauch jaate the and jaipur mai ek din jo itni hassi ayyi thi LOL, woh antragini mai har cheez ghumne ka junoon And jo tumlogo ne meri hard-drive hi udaa di .... sab yaad hai mujhe 😑. I am happy that you can keep some little secrets of mine 🙃.  I know you have a strong determination to succeed and surely you will baas humlog milte rhee chahe khi bhi job hooo ...... ab ek saal tumlog ke bina bitana padegaa mujhee 😣",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60a52310819323d199d48391,Riya  Katiyar

I guess I will always remember both MSO courses done with you, atleast someone to share the pain with. You've always been such a great and helping friend and I cant thank you enough for that.
Yes cats are so cool and kawaii and so are you 😬. Its always to fun to spam you with stickers and that isn't going to stop anytime soon. We've hardly spent time exploring the campus or kanpur , I hope we get to do it in the last semester and makeup for the lost time.",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60c5a534659165b3aa6462b2,Sunamya  Gupta
