We have been through so much, it is nearly impossible to write it all down in this. Bhai you are one of the most genuine and down to earth person I have seen in IITK, and I couldn't be happier to find you as a friend. Thanks for helping me all the times, be it in academics or keeping me sane when I lost the elections. Bhai tu jaan h aur raise hi rhna. Hopefully tu Bangalore aata rahega milne. 
Love you man.
P.S. yes I didn't recognize you in our first awkward meeting in CCD but well yea I made up for that. ",Siddharth  Goel,True,60a589a6819323d199d486f6,Akhilesh  Chauhan

Tu akela bnda h jiske chakkar mei hockey ke saare gam jhele jaate the. Kaafi hockey kheli apan ne aur kaafi kaam bhi kiye saath mei. Abhi bhi mujhe dhyaan h apan dono ko subah jldi uthke horse riding workshop sambhalni thi aur poore time tune mera saath diya tha. ❤️❤️
Couldn’t have asked for a better player and a teammate. Apna kaam krne ka attitude mat khona and all the best bhai. ",Siddharth  Goel,True,60a58e94819323d199d48709,Anshuman  Pal
2,"Bhai, somesh ke chakkar mei mile the pr nasho pr apni dosti hui. Wo C-Bot mei mauhal ki kaafi achi yaadein, ya wo antaragni mei rap battle mei machana. Hopefully SBG mei bhi aate rahoge tum and karenge phir party. Tb tk take care and have a blast.

I know mei ye likhne mei kaafi late ho gaya but samajhna zaruri tha ki ye bnda jo shayad mera bachpan ka pehela dost tha uske bare mei kya likhna h. Ye to kisi luck se kam nhi tha ki hisar mei jitne bnde aaye usme se tu bhi kanpur aa gaya but I am very glad this happened. You have been a constant source of inspiration to me and one of the best people I found in IITK. Apna 4 saal ke iss safar mei kaand to bohot hue h, jisme se tujhe kisi ke saath set up krne wale mei sbse bada chutiyaap hua the xD. Pr tha to wo ek alag experinence hi. Aur agra trip mei jitne kaand meine kiye the, offline cafe mei tune poora bdla to nikal hi liya tha. Apni kanpur se hisar ki trip bhi beer peekr kaafi hi mast ho hi jaati thi. Bhai tera to certified tha hall 2, stay kahi bhi kr le pr dil se to hall 2 ka hi tha tu which was a blessing in disguise. Bohot koshish baad tune squash mei to hara hi diya tha mujhe aur teri dedication dekhke to inter IIT gold door nhi lagta tha. Courses to apan ne zyada nhi saath kiye pr jitne bhi kiye tune nikalva hi diye maze mei. I am still very grateful to you for being with me on the night of the election results and forcing me to go out. That was a pretty amazing outing. Baki bhai jitna tera ek shaant se ladke se transformation hota dekha h, utna shayad hi kisi ka dekho ho and I am so fucking proud of the person you have become. The only regret I have is not going on another trip with you but lets go party somewhere soon. I am confident that with the luck we have, we will be working in the same company or at least the same city again very soon.
Till next time,
Sid",Siddharth  Goel,True,60bd2786659165b3aa645039,Shivam  Arya

We have come a long way from EE200 and I am so glad about it. I remember you being someone who would take everything way too seriously to someone who can chill out and still get shit done. So proud to see this growth :p (you can thank me later) 
Placements would have been impossible without you and thanks for keeping me sane when all was spiralling out of control. 
One thing I can never understand is how we passed all the DE, and are finally graduating. EE will always remain a mystery I guess. 
Kudos to the numerous theories we related to (especially the imposter syndrome one)
SBG is gonna be another amazing chapter where we’ll take the world for a ride. 
See ya soon. Take care. Love you man!!

Pr bhai wo din ek alag hi highlight this uss summer ki. Phirse karenge kabhi to recreate xD",Siddharth  Goel,True,60bd28ab659165b3aa64503a,Swapnil  Tripathi
7,"Bro!!
You have been one hell of a friend all the way along. Be it Udghosh, Batti department or managing my electoral campaign (for which I still owe you a party), I could not have asked for someone better. One of the best memories I have with you is working in Udghosh and one night going to the OAT drunk off our asses and talking about everything or you saving my ass countless times during the batti quizzes. Hope you enjoy what lies ahead of you. All the best man!!",Siddharth  Goel,False,60a59077819323d199d48715,Tushank  Gupta

Tumhare chakkar mei hi apan kaam karva paye poore Udghosh mei. Kya time tha pr fest waala, aur itni dikkato mei bhi acha manage to kr hi liya. Baki tumhare chakkar mei meine bhi wo blue wali drink banana seekh liya aur ab bartending ka course bhi kr liya XD. Baki to abhi apni parties to shuru hui h. Tum officer ban jao phir to poori life hi party h. Aise hi mast aadmi rhna and all the best man!!",Siddharth  Goel,True,60a58b3e819323d199d486fd,Utkarsh  Singh
