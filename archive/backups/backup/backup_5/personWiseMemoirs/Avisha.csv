Man, you had an exciting graph over the years. I remember we first had a good talk during Y18's treasure hunt. It was a very candid conversation and filled with wisdom on how to open Kurkure packets properly. You sure learned it well :P 
Our occasional catch-ups and meals used to be a refreshing change from usual circles and mundane routines. I will never forget the Feni tasting event bash in my room. I sure did get a lot of kicks from watching you kicking in the air.

You have been a constant part of the journey since the first semester, and despite our differences, we always managed to make unforgettable memories here. Crazy cycle rides, beer-sneak incident, midnight mosquito reproduction lectures, and rolling at Nicki Minaj’s music videos, to list a few.

I have never met anyone kinder than you. I don’t know if this observation is correct or not, but I think the most beautiful thing about you is that you find your motivation within yourself. Your resolve to keep growing and learning new things on the way is astounding. You have constantly pushed yourself during these last four years, and it has been nothing but impressive to watch that. 

There were times when I would come to CCD and rant to you for hours about tiresome social situations. It was never so relatable with anyone else :P
We soon got busy in our own lives, departments and careers after a point, but you always came through when it counted. I know you always had my back.

Okay, I am going to stop here with the fangirling and talk about real stuff now. Here it comes - Medhaa, coffee piyegi kya? xD  
I mainly wanted an excuse to talk to you and what could have been a better excuse than a coffee date. I feel bad that we didn't get a chance to bond back in the first year, but it was cathartic when we did it. I have mad respect for your courage and attitude towards life.

Dancing a night before MTH exams or drawing NSFW stick figures on the walls, your spirit for adventure and mischief is infectious! 
I love that even though we didn't hang out much later, our conversations were always refreshing and brought us closer. We never hesitated in spilling our secrets to each other and giggling about them later :D
You have always amazed me by picking yourself up time and again through the darkest of times. I know behind that effortlessly adorable face is a very hard-working and determined person. 
Whenever I miss you, I am going to put some crazy music and dance (read twerk) to it while getting ready for the day <3

I remember it didn't take me much time to be comfortable around you. You are kind and make it easy to talk to you. I had a lot of fun with you during the CGS course, where we totally copied our way out.

30,"*starting the memoir with one of my many laments starting with Priyaa or Sun na*
People might find your bio quite apt, but I can't agree with the phrase 'plain awkward' at all. You have such an eclectic mix of awkward moments, all of which can't be described here, but I am going with my favourite one. 
""I have decided I won't have labs on Mondays"" — that painfully awkward moment when you realise your lab is, in fact, on Mondays.

People always asked me how are you and I, such good friends, despite having supposedly opposite personalities? This question always brought a big smile to my face imagining how I would tell you about this later. 
It was always so simple with us. If I am hungry, you will accompany me to the canteen, simple. And, if I don't like someone, you will talk about throwing them out of the window for eternity but never do it, again simple xD. 
You are my best high companion, horse riding partner, favourite coffee date, and undoubtedly the first and last person to do Titanic pose with me :D

EE would unmistakably kill me in your absence. So thanks for saving my life there and also from crazy campus dogs.
Our relationship was mostly taking turns to handle and pamper each other. Whether it was cooking up conspiracy theories, daydreaming about fancy vacations, wishful thinking about EE courses getting cancelled, motivating each other to stay awake till breakfast after a night out, or any ordinary day at IITK with you, it was all worth it.
We have come a long way from that stapler to our T-spanner, lonely Vodka to shared coffees and formal hellos to teary goodbyes, and now there is no right way to end this sentence because our journey doesn't end here.

Since this was going to be things left unsaid version so here it comes —
Your loyalty towards friends is commendable. You indeed are a force of nature in providing your friends unconditional faith and support (also when a lizard manages to enter your room xD). 

I am fortunate I had the liberty, comfort and sheer thrill of unleashing my authentic self in front of someone during these four years. The amount of shit I have unloaded on you is enormous, but still somehow less than the time you take to style your hair (this, of course, needed a mention here :P). 
It was cathartic to come to your room after a long day and just rant while finishing your food. Just talking to you made me feel better.

Also, I can not emphasise the importance of your words to me enough. It means a lot when you give me your honest opinions and never hold back while cheering me up. 
You calling me Avisaaa has always stopped me in my tracks. It always pulled me out of detached-from-reality breakdowns or distracting moments. 
""One step at a time"" — I will always carry these words with me; they always had a calming effect on me in the worst of times. 
It's scary that just these words will always hold such power over me, but it's even scarier that now you won't always be there to say them in person to me. 

You have my heart
