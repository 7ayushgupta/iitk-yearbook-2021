8,"You are a great friend and a good influence. As you have pointed out earlier several times that you profess a forceful espousal of opinions, I knew it well to filter some of the good ones, until this vigilance was not needed at all. Among all the good times I regard the 4th sem the best and particularly those TA202 labs. Mahesh the builder!!! C220 labs with all the jokes and 'shayaris' remain still a great memory. Our secret mission with the 'one who must not be named' must have a special place in our memories. Looking forward to good times ahead and really fruitful discussions among great jokes and 'shayaris'.",Md Saquib Hussain,True,608723a9819323d199d46e2e,Rushikesh  Najan
9,Staying carefree in even the fifth sem is something you must be rewarded for. Among all the good times I regard the 4th sem the best and particularly those TA202 labs. Mahesh the builder!!! C220 labs with all the jokes and 'shayaris' remain still a great memory like when I said 'chor hu magar dilo ka'. Our secret mission with the 'one who must not be named' must have a unique place in our experience.  Looking forward to good times ahead and really fruitful discussions among great jokes and 'shayaris'.,Md Saquib Hussain,False,60a5e2c0819323d199d487c0,Rushikesh  Najan
