You're one of the most humble persons I have ever met and the best roomie I could/would ever get. Bro apni toh itni memories hai and future me bhi hongi, yaha likhna toh formality hogi but ok.

Starting from the day-1, I was worried ki mera roomie kaisa hoga but after I met you, tabhi pta chal gya tha ki I have got such a calm and nice roomie. Mere parents bhi first day hi samjh gye the ki I have got such a nice roomie. Also hum dono hi kitna shy the xD. Uske baad to kitna maja kia h wing me. First year me toh apni classes ka time alag tha and baaki time tu mostly Athletics me rehta tha.. so I got some time alone (ykwim 😛). You never complained about anything and roomies hone k baad bhi humne kabhi kisi chhoti si baat pe bhi ladai nhi ki ❤️. 

Second year me bhi no doubt firse roomies. Tera (Apna) breakfast almost hamesha hi miss hota tha xD. When you (and Abhinav) got to know something, and kaafi discussions huye xD. Kaafi stories share ki h and kaafi kuch seekha tujhse. Apni sath me jada trips to nhi huyi but apne Dharmshala wali trip ab tak ki best thi. Unplanned trip, unplanned trek.. sab kuch me bhot maja aya. Kaise apan ne Tarish ko Trek k liye push kia, raatko vo camping.. everything was fun.

Canteen/Shop C/Mama Mio/Oat/Z square kahi bhi jana ho toh mostly sath me hi gye h and it was always fun. Tu kaafi chaapu hai and I am sure tu kaafi acha krega life me. Jaldi se apni lab set up krle 😛 and fir PhD and fir New Zealand me bhi settle hona h 😛. Campus me jo last 30 days beetaye, was the best thing that happened to me after 2020, thanks to you and other wingies. Yaar campus k day-1 se Kanpur me last day tak sath me the.. even when I was leaving Kanpur, bus stand pe bhi ham sath me the ❤️❤️. I am sure hamara ye bond poori life rahega and milte rahenge ofc. I feel myself really lucky that I met you.

All the best for your future!
Love you bro ❤️❤️

P.S.: Ek baat ka hamesha dukh rahega life me jo campus me nhi kr paye..... Mio Cornetto nhi kha paye despite our innumerable tries ;-;",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60c089b9659165b3aa6451a5,Abhijeet

and har ladki ki kundli xD. Sirf baal dekhke tu lakdi ki kundli bta skta h!! Sadly tere sath koi trip nhi ho payi :( but dw at least ek trip toh jarur krenge. Hope ki tu last 30 days campus me aata but okay.

I know tune memoirs public toh krne h nhi but still likh hi deta hu xD. Sabse pehle mai tujhe TA201 me mila. Bro kaafi maza aya tha vo tatti sa project krne me.. vo blades wala (kya naam tha bc).. Yaar vo pura na ho pata agar tu usko ghar se complete na krwake lata xDD.
Uske baad thoda bhot hi/hello ho jata tha.. then hamare ML k exams me ek sath seat thi :P.. Hum dono ek dusre k bharose aate the exam dene xD. Fir same internship.. kaafi maja aya usme bhi. tbh starting me toh mai thoda disappoited tha kyunki mujhe laga tha ki hum same team me honge toh dono hi fraud maarenge lmao but aisa nhi hua xD. Kaafi ache se nikl gyi internship.
Bro tujhse interact baat krna hamesha acha lagta h and BT share krna toh is always fun. Ab toh ja bhi same hi jagah rhe h (hopefully :P). Agar WFH nhi hota toh kaafi maje krte Noida me but chill hai.. Milte rahenge bro <3",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60c12fa6659165b3aa6453b4,Abhishek  Bhatia

Hum log toh hopefully milte rahenge and abhi kaafi saari trips bhi to krni h ;).

You have mostly been busy in Antaragni and stuff, so utna jada maze nhi kr paye jitna maine baaki wingies k sath kia but jitna bhi time spend kia, it was always fun (not saying ki humne kam time spend kia.. kaafi time spend kia xD). Tere sath masti krne me maza ata tha (and calling you 'chuuutiyaaaa') :P
and yes hum log pakka trip pe chalenge ye covid situation thoda improve hone pe. Aise hi humesha haste rehna.

And uske baad PE me bhi same batch me the, CHM lab me bhi ham table neighbours the xD and tab bhi interaction was fun. Second year k baad thoda limited interaction hua (until the last 30 days spent in campus <3) but ok.. Last 30 days jitna bhi hangout kia (Oat/Chocolate  room/Urban Crave), it was fun.

Kaafi memories h hamari and I am very lazy to write (for the second time now ;-;) but still here we go.

First year me toh I knew you as ""Harsh, Abhinav ka coaching batchmate"". I don't remember when we talked for the first time but it was regarding grades I guess.

I got to know you more from second year. I still remember CS201 k endsem me tu 1 ghanta late aaya tha exam dene xD fir bhi chaap dia. I guess hamara interaction mostly spam grp k baad hua tha.. and classes me ho jata tha irl. Fir you, me and Sayak decided to work under Pramod sir.. and summers me unka kaam (fraud?) kia 😛. Bro tu kuch bhi achieve kr skta h you just need motivation.. jaise maine and Sayak ne tujhse PVF k naam pe sab code krwa lia tha xD.

Third year me toh fir we took that project as UGP. I still regret hame vo 9 credits ka ugp lena chahiye tha but ok. And yeah ICPC dia sath me (noovs us). Uss sem toh hamne kaafi gariyaya certain profs ko (ykwim 😛). Anyway ro-dho k nikal gya vo sem. And yeah internship drive me jo BT hui thi, agar savior Adobe na aati toh hamara kya hota!! But it ended well. Fir toh sixth sem k baad toh teri dasse ki streak start ho gyi xD (bade log).

Last k 30 days on campus were really fun. Thanks for the wing photoshoot and oximeter whenever required. And yeah ab toh same hi jagah job h (hopefully) toh onsite hone k baad parties toh krte rahenge obv (mai daaru nhi peeyunga though ;-;). Chal all the best for your future. I know tu chaapta rahega. Love you bro ❤️

P.S.: Don't worry bro, apne Adobe me chaapenge (unless you cheat on me by joining some other company) and if need arises, we can always switch.",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60c23c62659165b3aa645c18,Mahajan Dipak Anil

I am sure agar itna dedication continue rakhe toh you'd definitely achieve great heights. And I still remember that chappal wala incident xD.

Kaafi maje kiye h first year me. First year me Mini Militia me kaafi maje aate the and you were a tough competition. Uske baad pubg me bhi kaafi maje kiye. Uske alawa Takneek/wing hangouts/mafia/Fests ftw. Second year k baad toh alag wing ho gyi thi toh interaction thoda kam ho gya. Ye last 30 days me kaafi maje kiye campus me, frisbee me kaafi maja aya. Last me hum 3-4 log hi bach gye the. Last to last day jab light chali gyi thi and toofan aya tha, uske baad humne ""Fight club"" dekhi. Hopefully future me milenge and I believe tu aise hi chaapte rahega..
