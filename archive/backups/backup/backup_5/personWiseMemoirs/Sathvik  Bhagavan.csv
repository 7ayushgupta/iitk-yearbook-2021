I have always enjoyed the time we have spent playing cricket or just discussing random stuff, maybe about cricket, courses, or general. I know and have full faith that you will succeed in your future! All the best! Let's hope we have a chance to meet again on campus. Cheers!",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abbc1b659165b3aa644dad,Atul  Kumar
1,"Hey Jay, It has been a great journey in IIT and more because of friends like you. We have spent a lot of time together in our first year, and I still remember all the help and guidance you had given in ESC Lab, TA lab. You are genuinely one of the most helpful and honest people I have seen in my life. The fun we had just chatting, trips, fests are all wonderful memories. I love your enthusiasm to play cricket and the same level, if not higher, in your work. All the best; I know you have a very bright future ahead. Let's plan a trip soon!

PS: Sorry for PMI. ",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60c22b84659165b3aa645a39,Jay  Gupta
2,"Hey Naman! I cannot describe what our friendship means to me. Over the four years, I have learned so much from you, especially how to be calm and keep your cool even in the most intimidating circumstances. You have always helped me whenever I needed it. All the classes that we attended together in our first year, assignments, exams, discussions, the fun we had in our rooms, Antagragni, trips, and other events are reminiscent memories. Also, your shenanigans made me laugh every time and forget about any tough day I had, and of course, the long hours of cricket playing will always be a pleasant memory for me. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors, and I have complete faith in you that you will succeed and fulfill your dreams. 

PS: I hope the book Undercover Economist is a gift for me from you :)",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60aa63c2819323d199d49450,Naman Agrawal (M Agrawal)
3,"Hey Nitish! I still remember you coming into my room, confirming and filling out all the forms for our internship at TAMU, excited for a good opportunity in summer. I also remember the conversation in the cab going home for Holi about Covid and its possible hindrance in our internship, and unfortunately, it did come true. I am sure we would have gotten to know each other very well if there would have been no covid. Anyhow, I really enjoyed all the limited conversations I had with you, especially in the airport, if you remember. All the best wishes for your future studies and possibly try to remain in touch. Cheers!",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abc1d1659165b3aa644daf,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
4,"Hey Prince, we have been together in the same wing for four years, and it's been a pleasure knowing you. I learnt a lot of things from you about politics, and especially Bihar 😁. We have had many fun moments and good discussions. Glad to see you are on the path to success. I hope you won't forget me after you become an IAS officer. All the best for your plans in the future (you know what I mean 😛)",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60c07537659165b3aa645191,Prince  Kumar
5,"Bro! Its been a pleasure knowing you. We have had lots of fun together, be it be on trips or Antaragni, it was always fun to be around you. I still remember the psychology exam, though 😝, and the presentation we had made, and the fun we had. Also, the experience in TA202 Lab!  The last two months were just amazing. All the best for your future, and I hope you won't forget me 😛. ",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60c22e46659165b3aa645a79,Priyanshu  Saxena
6,"Hey Sabhay! I don't have any words to describe how special our friendship is to me. The fun we had together everywhere on the campus, in classes, playing, trips to serious discussions on various topics, I have enjoyed each moment. I remember we played a lot of mobile cricket games, especially in our database class 😁.  I am forever indebted to you for the help you gave me in all the courses 🙏. I am very happy for all the success you have had till now and completely sure you would soar to great heights!

7,"Bro! The four years in IIT was amazing because of friends like you! Our Mech Department journey was a mixture of hard work, frustration, and also loads of fun that we had together. All the assignments we did together, exams we studied, and discussions regarding career, life, cricket, books, and going to classes together are all beautiful memories.  The last two months were just amazing, be it cricket, ME401 😝, or eating Maggi at 2 am; it was enjoyable. I will always remember the photoshoot we had.  All the best! You already have a bright career ahead of you. I hope you would keep in touch.",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60c23077659165b3aa645abd,Saksham  Katiyar
8,"Hey bro! Time has flown by, and our friendship has strengthened. Even though NLP may be a course with no good experience, as a result of that, we did get closer through the course. I still remember the conversation we had about God and Mysticism, and both of us had opposite views 😛 . All the cricket that we played together is all but a happy memory for me. All the best for your future! I hope we can meet again on the campus soon.",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abbe69659165b3aa644dae,Saurab  Jain
9,"Hey bro! From the project in TA201A, where we met for the first time, we have come a long way. I can safely say you are one of the closest friends of all time. From all the struggles in Mechanical Department, all the restless nights going through assignments, sitting in lectures together, discussing life, career, you have been a constant mate in all this chaos. Whenever I felt bad about anything, you cheer me up, and every time we talk, it usually ends more than an hour! I am pleased about all the successes you have achieved in your life and have full faith that you will flourish in any path you undertake. All the best for your future! I know we would always be in touch! 😛 ",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abba18659165b3aa644dac,Shashi  Ranjan
10,"Hey Suyash! The four years I spent in Mech and IIT would not have been great without friends like you.

We have had many good memories, be it on trips, Antaragni, or just playing cricket (and mafia :)) or chitchatting in the wing, but some of them do stick out. One of them was the prank you had pulled in our first year about the ESC exam 😂.  The time during the project of TA202 was also riddled with fun and some frustration as well. I quite enjoyed working with you. I have always enjoyed our conversations regarding mechanical courses, life, career and beyond. I have always admired your hard work, simplicity and dedication in everything you do. I have learnt a great many things from you. Wishing you all the best for your blazingly amazing career ahead of you. Do keep in touch!

PS: Let's plan a trip soon.",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60c2585e659165b3aa6460ca,Suyash  Singh
11,"Hey man! We have come a long way from our first year together. I really love and admire the growth I have seen in you. We have had loads of fun together, be it long hours of playing cricket, trips to amazing places with the group, great discussions about many things, Antaragni, and also going through the DS course together 😛.  I also remember the fun we had playing quizzes in our first year and earning money 🤑. 

These last two months that we spent are something I would never forget in my life, especially playing cricket and countless times deciding to order food online or chatting, laughing and spending amazing time.

I sincerely thank you for encouraging me to come out of my comfort zone and experience new things in life, especially in my second year 🙏. You really helped me in gaining some perspective as to what I want to do in life. I have learnt a lot from you.

I hope we meet soon, either on a trip or back on campus. Also, I hope you won't forget me 😝. All the best for your already bright future!",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60bf3a4f659165b3aa645097,Utkarsh

Been fun to talk about all things and had lots of fun! I know you have a promising career ahead of you! All the best! Be in touch!",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60c23d6a659165b3aa645c35,Yash  Srivastava
