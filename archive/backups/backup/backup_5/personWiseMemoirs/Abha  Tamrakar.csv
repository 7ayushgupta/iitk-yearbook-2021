Ek dusre ko baate batane ke liye marte rhte the din bhr, hamesha sath khane jana upr se jyese hi mess khule vese hi. Almost hr jagah sath jana se leke serials, movies, khana sab share kiya hai hamne and those are precious memories of my life jo hamesha mere sath rhengi.

Aur tumhare kando ke bare me kya hi bolu ek din me 4-5 toh kr hi aati thi aur phir ham sath byeth ke discuss krte the and decide krte the ki krna kya hai ab is masle ka. Adhi college life toh isi me beet gayi XD

I will forever be grateful to IITK for giving me friend like you for lifetime. I know tu hamesha mere sath rhogi and this feeling is enough to feel comfort.

And at last (vese baate toh bahut hai) thanks mujhe bharosa dilane ke liye ki yesi dosti bhi hoti hai, I love you and I wish ki tumhe jindgi me hr khusi mile and tum hamesha chaapti rho yr field me. Always be happy and healthy.

13,"Heyo!!! I have a lot to say about you, but mujhe der hai ki me aapn ki itni special friendship ko words ke through justification nhi de paugi but still, I will try my best. It all started with TA202(so I think it is a very good course 😝 ) and I wish it to never end. From all common courses (except that siva sir course that I regret ki mene kyu nhi liya) to coffee hangouts, to huhi raaste me milkr baate krna we have shared an unique bond. Tujhse baat krne me kabhi sochna hi nhi pda, and you are the very few people with whom I can share my struggles without any efforts because you understand it to the level of my pain, and you can share yours too and we both can relate, I think that is very important in a deep friendship, to know each other better. Tujhse bahut dino me baate hoti hai, but kabhi vo lag feel hota hi nhi, ham kisi bhi topic me exactly same thoughts ke sath ghanto baate kr sakte hai, be it courses ke liye rona, profs ki burayian, jindgi kis level tak jhand hai, literally anything.

You are very few in the campus jo itna accha hai, hamesha help ke liye ready (whether I have to talk about anything, arranging that shirt- mene use nhi ki vo alag baat hai 😅 ) and your words can never hurt anyone. Please always be that sweet and good-hearted man (you are rare believe me).

Movies toh teri galti hai tujhe mere sath dekhni chahiye thi 🙃 , vo ek bhi meri vajah se hi ho payi and for photos ham bilcul sath me click krenge. I promise ham jaldi hi milenge and will go for a trip too, bas ye corona khatam ho.

Bas ek hi problem hai mujhe tujhse tune aaj tak mujhe aapni crush ka nam nhi bataya 🤣

All the best for your all future endeavours. Always be healthy and happy. Loadss of love to you 💞 !!!!!

I think hamne similar struggles face kiye hai so we can easily relate to each other, and share them without any hesitation, yaad hai vo oat me ham dono jo baate ki thi that was so comforting, hame aur yese sessions krne chahiye thi yrr but mauka hi nhi mila yrr. I remember going to canteen with you (that was very rare of me) and eating special fry maggi and talking about the exam next morning jiska hame kuch nhi aata hota tha 😝 . All those chemical classes together were just fun, we used to play and talk in 2nd-3rd row and hamare profs bhi acche the ki hame kuch bolte nhi the 😝 . Ranting about courses, profs and meshed up life were just our routine work back then and now they are precious memories.
