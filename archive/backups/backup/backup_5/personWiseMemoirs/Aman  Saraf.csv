0,"Bro!! Thanks for being the most chill person in the wing and for always looking out for me, and forcing me to have fun! With the number of memories we have, it's almost guaranteed that I will forget something, but let me try anyway. Orientation 2017 & 2018.....Multiple trips to Mocha and Liqquid.....Not to forget every Antaragni and Techkriti ever .....the list goes on and on. Although our time in IITK was cut short by the pandemic, we have many pegs (xD) to go before we sleep! Abhi toh picture baaki hai mere dost!",Aman  Saraf,True,60c22776659165b3aa6459da,Chirag  Kapoor
1,"Pankaj Mere Bhai (Quite Literally lmao),
I have never seen someone with a love for literature  as great as yours! Being one of the best people to share philosophical thoughts with, some of the most interesting conversations I have had on campus  are with you. Baaki cocktails and parties toh chalengi bro, whenever and wherever we meet! This is not goodbye its only until nextime!

PS: Campus ki best cycle ka award tujhe milna chahiye!",Aman  Saraf,True,60a6730f819323d199d49015,Pankaj  Kumar
2,"Bhai, 4 saal EE mein tere karan nikle hai! From copying labwork to partying, humne sabse boring se sabse interesting cheeze saath mein ki hai! Its not everyday ki someone comes across a chill person like you, who you can depend on.
Thanks for the chickblast memories and borrowing (stealing xD) my mouse! Thanks for being the guy who I could laugh with after EE stress and for finishing all the hot water before I could go for a bath!  Mostly, thanks for being there, hamesha! 
Anyway ye sentimental posts likhne ka yeh matlab nahi hai ki this is goodbye. It's just see you later!",Aman  Saraf,True,60c2256c659165b3aa6459ab,Ritesh  Naik
