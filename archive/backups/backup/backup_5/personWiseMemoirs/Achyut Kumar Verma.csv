Yaar pehli baat to ye ki apan PHY lab partner the. 😛 (Damn! how could you forget) 
Those were fun times man, I really enjoyed your company. Aur bhai TA ki boring labs tmhare karan hi majedar rahi, apna group hi bakchod tha bhai. TA ki endsem me tu saviour nikla bhai, tera lefty hone ka advantage xD (btw ye chiz kaafi logo ne mention kara hai, lol) 

Although we could have shared the journey more together, had I not switched my branch. But there are few things I would like you to know:
Tujhse hamesha motivational vibes aati rahi hai yaar. Machau to tu hai hi wo alag baat hai ki sir sir bolke logon ka kaat ta rehta hai. 😂
Yaar personally 5th sem was my toughest time, and you were one of those to whom I looked up at and believed that I would do better as well. I wish I would have talked with you at that time. :/
Tera active involvement in Antragani and other activities was also the reason what motivated and pushed me to try out something in Techkriti. Literally, I was the person to avoid these kinda stuffs. And I really enjoyed doing that.

Baki to teri chaapuness ki khabar milti hi rehti thi, isi tarah machate rehna bhai. 🔥 Wish you great success and happiness. Yaad rakhna bhai ko. 
Yaar sahi me milte hai jaldi hi. ❤️",Achyut Kumar Verma,True,60c3a950659165b3aa64625c,Aditya  Gupta
1,"Yo Bandar! 
To sabse pehle to bahut jyada aalas karne ke bad I decided to write memoirs. And then I was confused ki start kisse karu, so thought to write off from the closest ones! And you are the first one :) 

Apan dono to jab first time mile the tab se hi hm dono ki vibes itni match karti thi. Tm, Snehan, Archies ye sab se bahut jaldi hi apna interaction comfortable level pe aa gya tha. Apna Bihari dost aur wo v same department wala, mujhe yaad hai 1st year me kitni dafa tere room pe hi aake pada rehta tha. Tu apna sunata tha, main apna. 1st year me then ESC labs karne ke baad aake rant karna sath me aur v bahut sari bakchodi karte the apan. 
Kaafi moments me you stood up by my side, thankful for that. Pure wing me meri sabse achi bonding tere sath hi ban gyi thi 1st year me. Isliye next room partner ke liye tujhse acha koi aur nahi hota. 

2nd year me departmental stuff suru ho gye, apan room ke sath sath labs and sare courses v sath me kar rhe the. Sath me kaafi chill out v kara hmne, cricket khel ke pure pasine me room aana, tera ""girlfriend chahiye"" ka occasional r***i r**a, sath me gym karna (although apan consistent nahi rhe) 😂, fir gym ke bad aloo ticky (lol), diwali pe room decoration, mera nahi nahane pe tera sunana. Breakfast aur dinner ke liye sath mess jana and conversations during that were a separate fun. 

ESC201 kitna rote rote khatm kiye, Suchitra Mathur ko kitna galiyaya tha Tu. Fir treat kha ke v aaya last me.
Apan aur v kafi sari chizen share kiye hote during the journey of 4 years had I been there in civil. But ye civil main jhel nahi paunga ye 3rd sem realise ho gya tha, although I was lucky enough ki meri department change ho gyi. Fir tum logo ke 4-4 labs hote the aur main akele wing me maze karta 😂

3rd year to apan split ho gye in different wings but still tere room pe aake jab tab door pit ke khulwa ke baith jata tha. Apne routine ko leke tm thoda serious the, Jo maine tmse sikha hai. Apan us wing me v kafi maze kare football, cricket, cards ya random bulla. 
Apan dono ka as such jhagda to mere ko yaad nahi aa rha, but agar kaha suni hota v tha to jaldi hi apan normal ho jate the. 

Are ha ek chiz to reh hi gayi, tera upsc ke taraf dedication. Tu day 1 se soch ke aaya tha ki tujhe yehi karna hai. Actually iss bare me main tujhse kaafi influence hua hu from the first year itself. Aur 2nd year aate aate tak to maine v soch liya tha ki bhai yehi karenge apan. Although baad me apan dono ne situation accordingly chizen decide kara. Tu ghar gya tha to sari NCERTs aur Standard books vagerah utha le aaya tha. Aur apan normal stuff pe v kafi discussion pelte the together.

4th year - yeha to bc apan kaafi disconnect ho gye... I think in the whole lockdown, Kuch counted calls rahe honge. Tu placements me aise v nahi baith rha tha to tujhse ekdum hi interaction low ho gya. But still, tere se kabhi bhi baat ho jata hai to mood chill ho jata hai.
Isi tarah hamesha hasta reh, and I've seen ki Tu stress ache se modulate karta hai. 

Are Ispe to ek incident Yaad aa gya. 
Raghvendra ne tmko aur deo ko milne ke liye bulaya tha aur us raat sale tm pura yehi bolte rahe ki pata nahi kyu bulaya hai kya karega, kya hoga. Main tere ko raat bhar samjhata raha.. lekin us din tera alag hi fata hua tha. 
Phir next day aake tera sunana all about confession and then fir chizen sort ho gyi. Raghvendra ne dono ke marks kaat ke chor diya aur tm ghar me btane se darr rhe the karke.


Aur bhi bahut sari countless memories hai bro, ye memoir kafi nahi hoga uske liye. Mujhe IITK me Tu dost nahi Bhai jaisa mil gya. 

All the best for your future aspirations. I'll be waiting to hear from you about cracking the IAS. 

Whenever you read this and want to talk or rant about anything... Just give me a call. I'll be there for you. ❤️ 
Stay in touch, buddy.",Achyut Kumar Verma,True,60a6ce85819323d199d491c0,Aniket  Raj

3,"Hey Zeeshan (look this version of your name is what I had known in the beginning, so I'll always stick to it)! I still thank myself for taking the decision of spending regular time in the library during the 6th sem. Otherwise sayad hi tmse iss level pe interaction ho pata.

A silent guy involved with his work, that's how I found you at the library. I don't remember who initiated the conversation first, but we both had the same pain point, i.e. about the internships. I was happy to have someone with the same goal of internship hunting. I guess that's what was most of our discussions went on initially.
To be honest, the 5th sem was already the toughest phase for me apart from the internship thing, and I was totally trying to recover from it. Meanwhile, I really got some gem friends and you are one of those gems.  

Internship Journey- man, there is a lot to say here, where do I even start from?
During the whole internship, I don't think there was any day that passed on without any chats or calls with you. Starting from the intimidating talks with Ashu and Snehanshu Sir to the most maze wali meetings, it was really some great experience and memories that I will always cherish.

Thankful to you for always being humble to listen all my RRs and uspe tmhara valuable suggestions dena. Well, if you ask me the best thing to tell about you. So that would be your honest feedback to others. 

Well, there are countless discussions we have had on many topics. Some of them I am able to recall is routine, discipline, family-time, ramjaan, book choices and many more. Few years down the line, if you are reading this, I hope it strikes some chunk memories in your mind. 

I would keep it clean by not including the academic discussions here. But yeah, do well in GSoC. All the very best for that. 
Although I didn't want to mention but respect for the unique values you live with. I hope you stay the same (and even if not that's okay xD).
Placement awaits and I would be eagerly waiting to hear something huge from you soon. Just ping me whenever you feel like to talk about ANYTHING. 
All the best for every amazing thing you do. ",Achyut Kumar Verma,True,60c3c1e6659165b3aa646267,Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh

I would just randomly mention Sunamya here since she came up multiple times in our conversations (not literally though) xD.  ",Achyut Kumar Verma,True,60c3c2a3659165b3aa646268,Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh

""Bhai padha de Yaar, paas kara de tu bas mere ko"" 

""Bhai pata hai mummy bol rhi thi ki bc Ghar ke samne wale college Ka application form le aayi hu, Main fail hua to wahi naam likha dengi.""

1st year me kitne maze kare the Bhai. Tere sath Nischay sulli ke maze lena sala kitna bada fattu tha bc wo. Ek raat to even chuhe se, lol.

Tu drams se laut ke aata tha aur hamare room pe aake assignments karta tha. Main aur sudhanshu to tujhe mostly jage hi milte the.

Apne 2nd year me kafi labs sath thi... Wo ESC ki labs ke bad doaa canteen me poha khana. Jaha main itni ehtiyaat barat rha hota tha, aur Tu mostly chill rehta tha. Aur bc hm dono ka final grade us course me bsdk same hi laga 😂😂.

Bhai tujhe maine complete transform hote dekha hai Yaar, and that is truly inspiring. 

From being a bit careless about acads and mostly involved in drams and other stuffs to the most serious aspirant and consistent gym hitter.
Bhai 3rd year tak to Tu kafi serious sa ho gya tha apni taiyari vagerah ko leke.. wo bilkul achi baat thi. Lekin ek baat ka dukh hota tha ki tere sath pehle jaise maze nahi ho pate the tab. Tm sale baat v karna ekdum se kam hi kar diye the. 

1st year me teri family ki royal IAS stories sunna. 😂 Dekh bhai nikaalna to tujhe hai hi. Phod diyo, intezaar rahega iss good news ka. 

Touch me rehna, Bhai ❤️",Achyut Kumar Verma,True,60c3b4b0659165b3aa646262,Siddharth  Barwal
