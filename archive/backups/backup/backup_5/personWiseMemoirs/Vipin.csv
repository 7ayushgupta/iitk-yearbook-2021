0,"Hello Mr. Ali 😀. Kese h aap. Mst hi honge as always with contagious smile and lightness in your eyes. You are a wonderful friend. I am extremely lucky that I met you. 
Aesa nhi tha ki hum 1st semester m bahut achche friends the, hum wingie the. Phir bhi tumhara mujhe campus bulaane m help krna is applaudable. Library jaate jaate tumhe pta chla ki Vipin to gya campus chhod kr. Tossing the bag aside, you said that mujhe no. do Vipin ke, bat krni h. “Koi bat nhi agr tumhe lagta h ki tumhare sath koi nhi to, m ho tumhare sath, m krunga madad tumhari bas tum campus aa jao ek bar.” “Jis cheez ke bare m tum kuchh nhi kr skte usko bare m mat socho, khush rho”. These words are like tip of iceberg. I can’t explain everything in words. But after listening to these words, a sudden outburst of confidence hit me. Despite failing to be in campus for 2 times, I came back for 3rd time and never left solely because of your support at that time and your belief in me. “Doobe ko teenke ka sahar”, what does this actually mean I get to know through you. You were like ray of light in darkness at that time. 
I admire your simplicity and helpful nature. But the story does not end here, the story started from here. Campus aakr blanket khridna, 1st sem ki fees submit krna, acads m help krna, motivate krna, gyaan ki baten krna, courses ka rona dhona, har mode par sath the tum mere. And I can’t be thankful enough for everything. The person that I am today would not exist without your never-ending support. You are the person who inspired me very much. That inspiration led me to apply for SG because I wanted to be the person like you who helps others.
You are sincere in your feelings. You are most religious and spiritual guy I ever met. I never saw you refusing to help or making excuses to avoid helping others. Har kisi ko padhne ko motivate krte rehte ho hmesha. Chaapu to h hi aap. Your hardwork speaks for itself. CHM se EE m aasan thodi brach change marna. Bas last m yhi khunga ki, Kbhi kbhi overthink krte ho cheezon ko lekr, overthink mt kiya kro bhai. Mzze kro aur khush rho.
Best of luck for your future endeavors and keep smiling 😀buddy. Love you bro 💖.  Apn to dual kr rhe h to milenge hi. Hoping to meet you soon bro 🤗.

1,"SG ki workshop se apni mulakat huyi aur TA ki lab se dosti shuru huyi. Time ke sath apna bond aur bhi gehra ho gya. Chahe TA m fraud maarna ho ya phir MOS jese course ko jhelna, sab apn ne sath m nikale. Inn sab harkaton ki wajah se to ek time pr mere khud ke department wale mujhe Civil dept ka smjhte the. Kanhaiya ke room pe movie night ya phir raat ko roll mangwana (tum logon ko to egg roll m hi mzza aata h hmesha) y sab batein bahut yaad aayengi. 
Bas 2 mode hi hote h tumhare : Normal mode aur Masti mode. Jab kbhi exam ka pressure jyada badh jata tha ya phir library m Numerical methods smjh nhi aata tha, tumhara Masti mode activate ho jaata tha. Aur jab Masti mode activate hota tha to kbhi academic area m ghoomna hota tha to kbhi DOAA canteen m chai. Z-square bas isliye jaana ki mujhe shopping krni h, tum hmesha taiyaar rehte the. Aur apni theatre wali movies, pta nhi kon panauti h apne m se pr apn movies m hmesha late ho jate the. Mujhe aaj bhi yaad h jab apn log EDM gye the, wo meri pehli EDM thi but uss raat itne mzze kiye ki wo hmesha yaadgar rhegi. Tum, m aur Kanhaiya apn jodi kafi nayab h, umeed h aage bhi aese hi barkarar rhegi. (🙈🙉🙊 )
Kafi logon ki help ki h tumne. Mene kbhi madad ke liye mna krte nhi dekha tumhe.  Mujhe hmesha motivate kiya h tumne despite my continuous complaining. You were always there for me in my failure as well as my little successes ❤. Apne kaam ko lekr to kafi dedicated and hardworking ho aap. Aesi thodi har kisi ko aage se prof bolta h - “Tumhe kaha jana h Btech ke bad, btao, m doonga recommendation”. 
Tumhari life ka ek nya chapter shuru hone wala h. Best of luck on your future journey aur aese hi chhapte rehna hmesha. Hoping to meet you soon. Aur haan apni trip pending h abhi, hopefully iss bar poori hogi👻.

2,"Hey Deepshikha !! Sireesha ke through mulqaat huyi apni. Approaching with a pleasant smile, hi hello hota rha LHC m apna. Y CSO wala course kesa h, “y hmare dept m nhi h, CHE ka h”.  Y CHM aur CHE bahut confusing h mere liye to😅. Do alg alg brach bna di. Bad m chm ke course m advice li, pr le koi nhi paaya 😅. HSO m bhi research paper likhwaya tumse, hmare dept wale prof ne.

In the end, I want to say that you are a wonderful friend. Hmesha patiently baat sunti ho aur support bhi krti ho. “Sab achcha Hoga, relax maar.” I hope that you keep this patience and positivity with you always. Aese hi mehnat krti rho, aage badhti rho, hard work would definitely pay off if not today then tomorrow.
Take care. Good luck for your future endeavours 👍✌.

I have high respect for you buddy. Jitne chaapu utne hi down to earth ho. You can be seen talking in a calm and pleasant tone with everyone at mess. If I have to name a person without any ego, I would definitely name you.  So simple like black & white and filled with positivity like proton. You are like a precious gem, the more you treasure the more it is valued. You are dedicated and hardworking person. Aapke to jyadatar kisse hi sune h, apni jyada bat nhi hoti thi. But I used to wonder how someone with this much talent and intelligence can be so open and welcoming. I highly admire your personality. 
Take care, buddy and good luck for your future journey. Keep moving forward and soar to new heights.

We met each other through Sireesha. We don’t share a lot of memories together but I would say that you are a cheerful person. Chill se courses kese lene h y to tumse hi seekhna chahiye. Sireesha hmesha kehti thi ki Kiran ne liya h course to achha hi hoga. Apn ne Sath m Research paper requirement wale mahaan course jhele to UGP ki rahat bhi dekhi. Tumne 413 m work divide ki nautanki face ki aur power cut ki majboori bhi. Partner ke yha bhi electricity shutdown to data handler ke ha bhi shutdown. Instead of losing your cool, you tried to settle the matter patiently. I appreciate your efforts and team-spirit.

Even if I start, I would be only touching tip of iceberg. Aapme m hi itni saari achchi qualities. You are as pure as water and as tranquil as sea. Ek taraf Mini militia, mobile legends bhi khelte ho to dusri taraf Football ko lekr passionate ho. Acads, intern m chapte ho to bulla maarte bhi dikhte ho. Trip m khub maze kiye. Usi m I think jyada kareeb se jaana tumhe. Hmesha muskurakr positivity failate ho. You dance with fun, welcome others with open arms. Your caring and encouraging side is like a cheery to the top. No one can wield simplicity like you. You are down to the earth person. Aur koi badle ya na badle, tum to Veg - partner rhoge 😜. Cheering with your smile and encouraging with your words, you supported me a lot. You are a wonderful friend. Although our paths crossed late but lets keep crossing paths like this in future.

6,"Krishan urf Kanhaiya, kya bole ab aapke bare m aap to prabhu h XD. BTop pr FBM ki scholarship se shuru huyi batein socha nhi tha ki itni anmol dosti de dengi. Krishan se kab Kanhaiya pr pahunch gye pta hi nhi chla. Tumne IITK ka har kona dekha h. Har jagah ko explore kiya h. Tumhara room pr hi movie nights hoti thi kyunki roomie to room pr rehta nhi tha. Kanpur ki shopping aur late pahunchkr theatre m dekhne wali movies bahut yaad aayengi. Hall 2 ka canteen band hone ke karan apn ne na jane kitne kathi roll mangwaye. Har raat krte the ki kal se nhi mangwayenge aur phir agli raat bhi yhi bat bolte the. Abdullah ke biscuit-chips drawer m bacha kr rakhte the taki koi aaye aur kha jaye. Raat ko mess ke saamne se paani lana aur series ke gappe marna. Mene jo bhi random series dekhi h, unko bas tumhe hi recommend kr skta ho kyunki aur koi to dekhta nhi tha unko. Kafi multi-dimensional ho tum. Tumhara bas chale to sare adventure ke kaam abhi poore kr lo. Apne kaam ko lekr kafi passionate rehte ho. Log chahe kuchh bhi kahe pr tum apni bat pr datkr khade rehte ho. Aese hi thodi SOS ke coordi bne ho 😁. Y to aese hi h, y to aese hi h, krte krte kafi kuchh chamatkar kiye tumne, chahe Panasonic ki intern ho ya Harvard ki conference. Khi pta chle bad m UPSC bhi tumne aese hi nikal di. Chhoti chhoti baton se lekr badi badi mushkilon m hmesha support kiya h. No matter what the situation is, tum kbhi motivate krna nhi chhode, you always had my back 🥰❤.
Bahar jane se pehle muh dhokr apne special comb se hmesha bal sawarte the, halanki bad m bhi wo wese hi rehte the 😜. Aasha h ki Tumhari, meri aur rajat ki dosti aese hi aage chalti rahegi. Sadly na to Manali trip ho payi aur na hi Dehradun wali, iss bar jab mauka milega tab pkka chlenge. Hoping to meet you soon.
Ab life ka ek nya safar shuru hone wala h. All the best for your future endeavours buddy. Aur koi glti huyi ho to maaf kr dena prabhu, apna Sudarshan chakra se prahar mt kr dena hum pr 😂.

7,"Sabke pyaare Mukku !! Ab kya bole aapke bare m, jitni tareef kre utni km h aapki.
Mukesh ka mtlb kya hota h – “Vaani ka devta”. I mean this name suits you very well, it matches with your personality. Jab bolte ho pyaar se hi bolte ho. Sincerity, hardworking, mentorship, kind-heart are a few of your best qualities.
Agr mene kisi ko campus m concepts ko itna passionately follow krte huye dekha h to wo tum ho. You would dive deeper into the problem till you get the main concepts behind it. You never memorize things. You understand the main framework. 
You create a welcoming environment. Room pke saamne dikhte hi hmesha bolte ho “baitho na Vipin Bhai, kaha ja he ho”. Hearing these words brings sense of belonging and connectedness.
You are selfless when it comes to helping others. I highly admire your mentorship qualities. You don’t take the usual way of mentoring someone by solving problem for others. If someone comes to you with a problem, you would sit down with him and first understand the gravity of the situation. Then, you would make that person solve that problem by himself by giving him subtle hints. If this quality does not qualify you as best mentor, I don’t know what would. 
You have zeal for victory. Cards m tab tak khelna jab tak jeet na jaaye ya phir game change krna jisme jeet ho. Smiley winning face changes into sad face when others conspire against him. Bhai game m sab chalta h 😜. You advocate for fair game. But bina cheating ke mazza kaha aata h. Aur usual game m tumhara irritated face bhi to nhi dekh payenge na 😂.
Don’t mess with Mukesh. He can fight his own battles 😜. FIFA to jaan h bhai ki. Controller mil jaaye bhai ko ek bar, phir bnde to apne aap dhoondh lena khelne wale. You are a wonderful friend❤. You have helped me a lot through my journey. You motivated me when I felt down. I won’t be able to thank you enough for everything. Tumhare sath kiye huye DS ke assignment hmesha yaad rhenge. Your dedication and invested hard work towards your goal inspires me a lot. You are true to your feelings.
Love songs bahut pasand h bhai ko. Chahe ho wo Jubin ke ho Darshan ke. You would be found searching for peace and healing in music and gazing stars when you are free at night. Cherishing your old friends and making new ones along the way, flashing the fearless smile, twisting ankle due to overexcitement and taking rest whole day on bed is like manifestation of your last few months at IITK. 
Buddy, Good luck on your new journey 😉. Keep moving forward and soar to new heights with the flashing smile and confidence you own. Hoping to meet you soon 🤗. Love you brother 💖.
P.S. – Realme ka tagline kya h 🤔. Dare to leap😜. Zindagi bahut chhoti h bhai, jo adventure krne ko mile wo sab kr daalo.

8,"Naam h Piyush, pr aapko pyar se sab aapko Raja Babu bolte h. Agr Raja Babu bolte h to aap iss title ke hakdar bhi h, reason: your likeable and pleasant personality. I aspire to have a great personality like you. You treat everyone with respect. You are the glue which holds the group together. You think of others before yourself. You are a keen observer. You exert warm aura of hospitality. On one hand, you have the elderly side of sorting out others differences, on the other hand you possess playful side as well. I have never seen you furious for yourself. If others wrong themselves, I have seen your caring side. I wonder how much patience you have. There is a threshold for caring others. But your care has no bounds. Coming into your room, I have never seen you indulging in your work rather than welcoming others. You are introspecting yourself every day. Your time utilizing skills are commendable. Revisiting your whole schedule of day in mind, and then assessing what changes can be made to optimise time further. You are empathetic. You are sincere to your feelings. Your learning agility, optimism and zeal to contribute for the betterment of the society are beyond praise. You have the quality of leader as well as traits of a good team member. You aspire to be IAS in near future. I am just gonna say that buddy go for it, you have my best wishes. You have what it takes to crack the exam and bear the responsibilities. You are a man of golden heart. You cherish your every single friend. Photography, calligraphy, reading books, writing your thoughts and noting down the impressive phrases are some of your hobbies. My yearbook dp was also clicked by you and it came out amazing thanks to your photography skills. Photography ki bat chl rhi h to Saini ko kese bhool skte h, apne group m to tum dono roomies hi shandaar photographer ho. 
In the last 1.5 months, I get to know you more closely. We played dumb charades and cards, watched movies, sang karaoke in last few months and everything is memorable. Mama-mio to air strip we covered many things and made our last campus memories. Photo-session to last feast at campus, pretty much everything emerged from your mind and could have happened because of your perseverance. From meeting Piyush to getting to know Raja Babu, I have learnt a lot of things from you. From being outlier to assimilating with everyone, you have supported and motivated me. Our friendship is invaluable as well as irreplaceable. I am blessed to have you as friend💕. Bas sachche pyaar milne wala scene nhi ho paya, pr wo bhi mil jayega bhai, aakhirkar achchi cheezen milne m waqt lagta h. 
I am certain that you will soar higher and achieve new heights. Good luck and best wishes for your future journey. Aur haan, jo plans bnaye h job krne ke time ke, wo bhi poori ho jayenge, bas thoda sa aur patient rho y waqt favourable nhi h. Bas waqt ki ek khasiyaat h ki y nikal jaata h. Corona kaal bhi nikal jayega. And then you would have plenty of time to accomplish everything you planned. 
I am not letting you go and you are not the one who forgets friends as time passes by. So, we would be in touch😜. Hoping to meet you soon🤗. Last m yhi kahunga ki bahut nek dil insaan ho tum ❤.

9,"Hello Raman!!
Log pyaar se Lamba bulate h aapko. Same coaching institute tha apna. Pr IITK m aakr hi mulaqaat huyi pehli bar. Pehle bhai bne aur phir sath m SG bhi bne. Poori wing m bas tum hi the mere dept se. Apni dosti dept ke courses jab sath krne lage tab jyada gehri huyi. Stata pe regression chlana, Somesh ka research paper likhna aur ab murli ke liye paper likhna, sab sath m kiya. Kitne ghatiya ghatiya course kiye apn ne sath me. Logon ki himmat nhi hoti aese courses lene ki. But apn ne liye aese courses. Some examples are: MOS, Numerical methods, Game Theory and finally IME. Last one was unpredictable. We didn’t know that there is an ounce of possibility that this course could be this labour intensive (eco se h to eco ki analogy to use kre😜) and shitty. You are the best teammate that I met at IITK. There were groups in many courses. But, courses in which we were a group didn’t feel difficult despite being cumbersome. Somehow, we knew how to finish the work.  We just divided our work and there were no differences whatsoever among us regarding work. Through you, I get to know many of our dept mates.
One of the best qualities you possess is hard work.  You genuinely put efforts to achieve your goal. Placement se pehle bahut chinta thi ki pta nhi kesa hoga, kaha hoga. But you never lost faith in yourself and emerged as a better version of yourself. Aur bhai ne phir ne OYO m placement lagwayi😀.
I highly appreciate your passion for sports, anime, movie and TV-series. You manage your time efficiently. You know exactly how much time to spend on study and how much on sports and anime 😜. Tv-series, movies ki recommendation leni ho ya Anime ki gup-shup, you are my go-to person. Agr kisi ko mere alawa saaf room rkhte huye dekha h to wo tum ho. You cleaning skills are far more superior than mine. Buddy, you have grown a lot. From taking chill courses to struggling with difficult courses and acing them. Tumhari padhne ki speed to lazawaab h ⚡⚡, bhai itna jldi koi kese padh skta h 😂😂. You are a little shy with the girls. Pr bhai nervous hone ki jagah, confidence se bolo jo bolna h. I am giving you this advice because I know tum kbhi kisi ko disrespecting aur hurt krne wale shabd nhi bologe. 
As this is our memoir, so I wanna confess something. I was hesitant to tell anyone about my crush and the reason was that our crush is the same person 😂😂. Maybe it was childish not to tell anyone, but yeah it happened 😂.
Almost sare sports khel liye tumne. Cricket, volleyball, basketball se lekr badminton tak. Cricket as a CPA to captaincy of volleyball, you evolved. Yaad h tumhe tum Dual bas isliye krna chahte the taki ek aur Inter-IIT khel pao aur apni team ko jeeta kr le aao. Your intense enthusiasm for sports is praiseworthy. 
You genuinely care for your friends. They are like haemoglobin of you blood. Our friendship can’t be described in words. We have great synergy together and we are a team always ❤. You have helped me throughout my whole IITK journey. Whether it is acads problem or my regular struggles😅, you always motivated me and said “Chill hai, sab badhiya hoga, chinta mat kr, sath m dekh lenge apn”. Enthu ki koi kami nhi h tumme. Semester start hone se lekr grades ka result aane tum dussa la rhe hote ho😁. Buddy, keep this positive attitude with you always and never lose your simplicity.
You have entered a new phase of your life. Good luck for your future endeavours. Apn to pass m hi rehte h to milter rhenge. Love you brother 💖.

Itne chhote se room m 3 log kese reh skte h. Sabka yhi reaction tha. When I look back in time, I feel silly because I thought that bhai Maharashtra se h, hindi nhi aati hogi. But then I was shocked by your Hindi. Bhai ko to aati h Hindi. You used to wonder: Bina brush kiye log kese kr skte h breakfast 😂😂. Those were times 🤣. Yaad h first year m, our room was like habitant of two different species coexisting together. Room ka ek side saaf, room ka middle part saaf aur dusri side m pawri ho rhi h 😂😂. 
Anime hota kya h tumne hi seekhaya. Kimi no nava dikhayi, Deathnote, AoT dikhaya. Y sab dekhkr anime m interest aaya. Aur phir bad m khud nhi dekha poora AoT😂. GOT se lekr Friends tak sab dekha tumne semesters m. Bolne ki jrurt to nhi h ki aap chapu ho. Sab log lage rehte the exam ka magne m aur aap kuchh hrs m padh kr ya bas exam attend krke hi chap dete the. Football ko lekr passionate ho. Messi vs Ronaldo aur FIFA m hi kab tumhara waqt nikal jata tha pta hi nhi chlta. Spoilers se bachne ke liye GOT ki subah screening krte the. Mess se jyada to tumhe canteen m hi dekha h bhai. Khana waqt par kha lena aur apni health ka dhyan rakhna bhai. Body m weakness mat aane dena. Agr koi nhane ko as a enjoyment dekhta h to wo tum ho.

You are one of a kind. You are the sincere and sweetest person I have ever met. I find tranquillity whenever I talk to you, my worries go away. Har kaam m hmesha positive attitude rakhte ho - “ho jayega bhai aaram se chill maar”. You wield confidence like armor. Kaha se late ho bhai itna confidence. Apni bat ko last tak defend krte ho. Be yourself and keep this attitude with you always buddy. You guys are the best roommates I could ask for. From nothingness to somethingness to usefulness, you were with me. It was childish of me to not let you know that I was leaving campus in first semester. I don’t know if I ever apologized, but accept my apologies now. Coming back to campus, you never let me feel alone. You were there for me, making me feel like home. Your methods were different from others. Engaging me with series/anime in my free time, helping me with academics aur anginaat kisse life ke. Pretty much kafi kuchh share kiya h apn ne. Chahe wo CHM lab ki bat ho ya MTH ki shuruaat. I am lucky to have amazing person like you as my roomie, as my friend and as my brother.

12,"Hey dear roomie !! 
You are the first Y17 I met in campus. From bhai to roomie to more than a real brother, this was our journey in short. When I came back to campus in 2nd semester, I vividly remember you saying this to one of our batchmates in Hall 2 canteen – “Bhai abhi abhi aaya h Vipin, thoda time do isko, go easy on him, isko draoo mt wapas thodi bhejna h”. It was not that our batchmate was intimidating me, but you understood the gravity of situation I was in and you were protecting me. That was your usual self. You would have done the same thing if anyone else were in my shoes. But Your kind gesture led be to believe that I am not alone. There are people rooting for me to recover and emerge stronger.
You see the best in everything. I am not saying that you don’t see the downfalls. Yes, you can see the both sides of the coin but you don’t ever let negative side dominate the positive side. You have an aura of warm hospitality. Anyone can seek guidance from you on any matter. I have learnt a lot of things from you. Being happy and calm despite difficulties tops this list. You were my home away from home. Thanks to you, I always feels that I have someone who would listen to me without any prejudices whatsoever. You are like a mentor, brother, friend everything wrapped in one.
Choosing you as my roommate was my best decision ever. If I can go back in time, then I would also do the same. From leaving IITK to not been able to leave IITK, I have evolved. I think I couldn’t have gotten my confidence back without your constant support. You always had my back. You never let me face difficulties alone. You motivated whenever I was down. You corrected me whenever I made mistakes. 
You are multidimensional. Who would have thought that sudden senator nomination could lead to the 3rd most vote counts. You are people person. Public speaking is your territory. I have never seen anyone so confident in getting A in HSS😂. You have vast knowledge in almost everything. You are hardworking. You can do anything if you decide to put your mind to it. From cracking into GS interview in intern drive to securing job at Blackrock, everyone has witnessed your hard work.
From learning French at IITK to learning Sanskrit at Mattur (Karnataka) in future, you have diverse array of interests. Cracking UPSC, opening NGO, donating for social cause, working as a social activist these are some things on your bucket list. You have zeal to try new things. OnePlus tagline “Never Settle” can be said as epitome of your life motto. I am lucky to have an amazing person like you by my side. Love you brother 🥰❤. I would definitely miss the random talks we used to have for hours lying in bed for hours. I don’t think I have to say it, but for the sake of memoir I am going to say it – we are not parting ever. Our bond is not that weak to be broken by passage of time.
You are off to a new journey of your life. Best of luck for your future endeavors and keep spreading positivity. Your smile is contagious, it need needs no reason, keep brightening the world with it.

Research paper bhi likh daale do to apn ne😜😂. UGP m mzze bhi kiye. Although FB m bahut chakkar katne pade the winter m apne ko UGP ki wajah se, but it was worthwhile. Yaad h apn ne poori class ko presentation bhej di thi 😅😅, man that was silly 😂. We had a blast in our dept courses. It is unfortunate that we won’t be doing same courses from now know. Koi nhi apn wese  hi mzze kr lenge sath m. 
You strive to learn meaning things. Mazdoori wali cheezon m time waste nhi krte. Jab lagta h ki y cheez kuchh sikhayegi apne ko, tab krte ho usko. You have a calm tone of speaking. You are an amazing friend. I know I can rely on you. You have helped me a lot, encouraged me whenever I felt down. I am grateful for many things. Love you brother ❤. 
Apn to 1 saal aur ruk rhe h campus m. 1 mauka aur h apne paas aur memories bnane ka. Milte h campus m 😀. Take care, good luck and Bye Bye 👋👋
P.S. - Tumhe to Kilvish bilkul pasand nhi h na. Hoga bhi kese kyunki Kilvish ko to andhera pasand h – “Andhera kayaam rahe 🙅‍♂‍🙅‍♂‍” 😜😂😂.

14,"First time CHM lab m mile the apn. Phir uske bad batein mulakatein dosti m tabdeel ho gyi. Aaj bhi yaad h Balaji Sir ka apne ko CHM lab m daantna aur phir aage jakr khud se muskuraana. 3.5 saal itna jldi nikal gye, pta hi nhi chla. Library m padhna, Hall 4 ki canteen m khana to kbhi campus m walk krna night m, sab yaad aayega. Shuruaat m apn dono kind of introverted the. Kafi kuchh ek dusre se seekha apn ne. Tumne mujhe jhela aur mene tumhe 😂. Dheere dheere friend circle bhi badha apna aur nye dost bnaye apn ne. You are a wonderful friend. You supported and motivated me whenever I faced difficulties. We had a great time together.
Kafi bar overthink krti ho ki khi tumhare actions kisi ko hurt na kre. Whi bat dohraunga ki chill maar, dost h smjhenge tujhe, tere actions ko bhi emotions ko bhi, bas ek bar aaram se situation smjha do unhe. I know IITK journey was not a piece of cake for you, you fell down, stood up even stronger and moved on. “Mujhe nhi pta kitne marks aaye mere” se lekr “Itne marks aaye mere” tak evolve huyi tum. You have worked on yourself. I applaud your efforts. I can see the lightness in your eyes when you talk about UPSC. Poora schedule bna rkha tha room m aur paste kr rkha tha, UPSC preparation ke liye. You are hardworking. Keep working on your ultimate goal and your hard work would pay in the end. Best of luck for your future endeavors.  Keep smiling and soaring higher.
I don’t know tumhe mera face kyu chuhe jesa lgta h 😂. M agr Rajasthani chuha ho to tum bhi Hyderabadi chuhiya🐭ho 😜.
