0,"Adesh bhai! I had the good fortune of having the best room mates in first year. Ek taraf Keshav, ek taraf tum.

Yaar sach bataun toh first few months were especially challenging for me because I had always been in my shell. But sharing my room with you, three of us being each other's closest friends and passing the time away in jokes and laughter was awesome. I remember tune apna chair sacrifice kar diya kyunki mujhe bed pe padhne ki aadat nahi this. NCC ke liye hum teeno ka rona dhona, Mini Militia ke games, tere school ke kisse, all of those a really good memories I have.

You are not like the most of us jo coaching ke badaulat aa  pahuche. Tune apne dam par phoda tha, apne dam par phoda hai and phodta rahega. Make sure you always remember that you are the literal embodiment of ""cream of the nation"" and once you put your mind to anything, you are surely going to ace it. 

Yaar tum jaise bando se mil paya, isiliye I think my stay at IITK has come to fruition. You are hardworking, care a lot about your friends, care a lot about your family and now are going to do a lot for this country. I still remember, how nicely you talk to your parents. Sometimes, as we pass the teenage phase, we start neglecting our family and but I learned from you that no matter what, family first.

You are an incredible human and although we didn't get a lot of time to catch up(last sem wapis campus bhi nahi aa paya mai) I will make sure that we meet soon. Ab toh aap bade aadmi banne waale ho so it might be tough for you to take time out, but because I have seen the kind of person you are and I have lived with you closely, I know you would.

Cheers dost

1,"Bhai Bakait! Yeh kya sab logo ne afwah faila rakha hi Jassa ne naam rakha tha tera. Baapu ne rakha tha bhai, and I remember it vividly. Apne hall me bakait ka definition jo bhi hai, uske chappuness waale matlab ko completely justify karta hai tu.

First year se hi the most dedicated individual in our wing. It is always very interesting going to your room and talking to you. Kabhi bhi khaali nahi baith ta tha tu and always trying to better yourself. And not just acads, I have also found your taste in movies/tv show to closely resemble my own and you are my go-to man to seek recommendations from.

 People do call out on your RR and I myself join the fun but I am sure no one actually means anything against you. And I have never seen you getting bothered by it too. I myself, have always found a really helpful guy in you whenever I need. Whether it be acads or any help, you never shy away.

Kaafi izzat bhi deta hai tu mujhe I don't know why. I don't deserve most of it and it shows more about you than it does about me. Your zeal towards success is something to aspire to.  I am sure you are going to climb the corporate ladder very soon and companies would be throwing money at you in no time.

Your graph in IITK has always had a positive slope (maybe a positive second differential as well), and I have seen your transition from a blank slate to what you are today. I wholeheartedly wish the best of luck to you so you continue on your trajectory and achieve whatever it is you want to be (I hear a lot of UPSC talks, eh?).

I have really enjoyed getting the chance to know people like you so closely throughout my stay at IITK. Apan trip pe kabhi nahi jaa paye abhi tak, Goa me bhi sirf last din mile. Let's make sure to arrange meetups whenever and wherever we can and keep in touch in future as well.

3,"The first people from IITK I ever met were you and Ojha. Pehli baar milke aisa laga tha bhai, yeh kaafi shaant swabhaav wala banda hai. Quiet and introverted. After, all these years with you, I can safely say that it was just a facade in front of your parents ;p 

 Kaafi kharab dance kiya tha maine aur tune freshers me, our first group ""project"". Then, PClub ke game dev competition me tune single-handedly jeeta diya. Tere hi wajah se graphics ka course liya tha jiske liye aaj bhi Keshav gaali deta hai mujhe. I never quite understood how that complex brain of yours thinks. Before studying anything, tu bolta hai ki tujhe nahi aata, and fir thode din baad milo toh bolta hai, arre yeh toh itna obvious tha.

One of the most chaapu and overachiever guys I have met. You always strive for perfection in whatever you do be it coding a game/RM room, making some sketch of a chair infront of you in your notebook, or your work. Super intelligent, kyunki you always ace all the coursework on any project but at the same time, have some out of the ordinary notions regarding Tulsi and whatnot. Having said that, you should know that I respect you a lot.   Goa trip me tere jokes, mere maze lena, and your awesome driving skills hamesha yaad rahenge.

 Let's finalize on that trip in August and will surely arrange one in Europe. You are the most baniya guy I have ever met. Combine that with that big fat brain of yours and we have my richest friend and acquaintance. Baitha hoga kisi hedge fund ka ceo ban ke 10 saal baad toh it's better that hum sab tere se connected rahe :p.

4,"Bohot mast aadmi hai yaar tu! Having discussions with you has always been such a great thing to have. Your ability to formulate arguments, back them up with logical deductions, and draw meaningful conclusions is phenomenal.

We had always interacted during courses but I think we had the most conversations in that internship season. Terese baat karke hamesha itna positive aur clear feel hota tha ki even that horrible time is a cherished memory.

You do know that you have a brilliant mind and I respect you a lot for that. You can work insanely hard if you put your mind onto something and that is something that will fetch you whatever it is you aspire to have. Moreover, you are not driven by the conventional measures of success and only pick up something if you genuinely like it. That's super commendable and I respect you a lot for it.

I would have loved to have many more discussions with you on computer science, career and life in general in our last semester. I never knew you were a fellow cricket enthusiast and of course bhai let's plan a trip to Lord's. Test is the truest forms of the game and I am always up for it!

After few minutes of utter silence and confusion, I one guy (out of the odd 400) pointing out that he did a small error somewhere in the first page (!!) of the proof.

I think we got to know each other better from the third-semester thermodynamics and in the time we spent together, I have come to know that you are one of the most helpful and honest guys I have ever met (and probably will meet).

8,"Bhai apan ek dusre ko Kota se jaante hai and I have seen your progress. Starting from a lower batch to getting the highest rank. You have managed to continue on that trajectory even at UG, and I am sure you will continue it even further along in your professional life.

We didn't have a lot of interaction in Kota but have great memories from the place, and I share that nostalgia with you. We started Undergrad with a freshers dance performance and maannn that was epic. Maybe people don't notice it often, but you can make people laugh and have made me laugh more than anyone in this college. I love your storied be it some incidents about your wing, Subhajit Sir, almost dying while river rafting or our inside jokes.


You are really pure from heart and have always been the most innocent guy.  You always speak about whatever you are feeling. Combine that with you intelligence and that makes you one of the rarest people anyone would come across. You always somehow make time to both work your ass off acing any task that you are assigned with and enjoy yourself to the fullest. You value friendships and relations, and I hope we maintain this friendship we have forever.

 Mai aur keshav ek team and tu aur durgesh ek team she shuruwat ki thi assignments and projects karne ki and that overall group has remained the same ever since  (Ayush had a wildcard entry). 

Every group needs a guy that leads from example and I am sure you already know it, but your are that guy in our group. Whatever task we are assigned to, you make sure that we do it super well and that's a quality which I think you should be proud of.  In this trip that we had, I saw how you were carrying us all. You were the one doing the hard stuff: managing our itinerary, negotiating prices, or taking care no one from our group is left out.  Let's make sure we have many more trips in the future.

I am indebted to IITK (and Kota ) for giving me the opportunity to meet people like you. Stay the same and prosper (which I am sure you would)

9,"There is no hiding how close we are, is it? One of the things I am most grateful for in my entire stay at IITK is the perchance that I got ""The"" Keshav Bansal as my roommate. That roll of dice, gave me a lifelong friend/mentor/role model and I am super grateful.

Everyone noticed that you were really shy and reserved in the first year but I always felt that you spoke when needed. You do not have any drive whatsoever to keep impressing people around you by talking and have believed in doing the work. Before that, this was something that I had only read or heard about, but with you I have seen it from my own eyes day in and day out. I proudly use you as an example while talking to anyone about what we should strive to be.


Many are humble from the outside, but you see that no one is always humble as you get to know them better. Well, I can attest to the fact that in the four years that I have been your roommate and closely worked with you on countless assignments and projects, you are humble through and through (even to the extent that I sometimes have to convince you of your caliber). 


I would have never learnt as much as I did, throughout the course of my stay here, if I hadn't met you. Your intelligence, ability to power through any task and your downright humbleness is unmatched to anything I have ever seen. And in addition to all of this, you have always been a great friend to me and we have shared countless laughs together. So believe me when I say there is literally nothing that makes me happier than being of any importance whatsoever in your life.  I have seen you transform into a more confident, funnier and a more chill-friendly version of yourself over the undergrad and I like to believe I have had some role to play in that.

There ought to be kinder people at the top of the food chain, and therefore I wish all the success to you.

I still have a lot to learn from you and will, therefore will try my level best to preserve this bond that we have.

10,"One of the nicest human being on campus!

The first memory I have of you is I think our first wing interaction seniors ne karwaya tha and ek bhaari awaaz wala patla dubla ladka. Your voice is opposite to your personality. The first time we talked about football was on the mess table and although it is sad ki you aren't a madrid supporter you have never been irrational in your analysis and passion. (Which is rare trust me)

I remember football,tech, music and dance to be the most common things we share, baaki tu hamesha meri leta toh rehta hi tha for being the 6 pack figure that I am.  I really enjoyed talking to whenever we met and saath me Shubham ki lene me kya maza aati thi.  Bhai bohot kam log hote hai tere jitne ache and dildaar. I have seen how you would never shy away with sharing whatever you own be it tere snacks, tere headphones etc. Tere senheisers ka use I think tere se zyada baaki sab ne kiya hai. Dil se ameer ka hone ka sahi matlab terese seekha hai maine.

Itna kind and selfless hona and on top of that being so intelligent is extremely rare bro. Last sem ka plan kiya tha woh toh pura nahi ho paya but jald hi milenge.  Humara Tomorrowland saath dekhne ka plan yaad toh hai na? Let's add an el classico to that list and make it happen.

Mujhe yaad the great partition of hagga, hagga ke iss paar waale B bot and uss paar waale and some other C bot.

I have the tendency to speak a little more than what is required but you never disliked me for that.

Tum jitna izzat mujhe dete ho, I am sure I don't deserve that but it makes it all the more important for me to continue this friendship for long.

Vishesh ke through hi hum mile the and I guess ESC ke lab ka discussion kiya tha sabse pehle. Uss samay hi tumhara focus clearly dikha tha mujhe and abhi tak the same holds true.

You have been an integral component of my journey through the storms of IITK. First year winters ka Microsoft challenge and lab ke PC par paper chhod ke jaana was lit. Third semester toh hum dene pura saath me baith ke padha tha be it probability ke assignments ka disucssion ya  Discrete aur Logic ke endsems. You are a lot like me in that you have a greater respect for work ethic than talent. Apne kaam se kaam rakhne wala and always taking others' effort in a positive light is a rare quality, especially in places like IITK.

Fourth Sem me tumhari advice maan leni chahiye thi and apping jaari rakhni chahiye thi. I remember towards the end bhi tumne woh KAIST ke prof ka bataya tha mujhe. Baaki harr couse me almost, projects and assignments me discussion kiya hai (insert the epic ""Chhod dijiye, aapse nahi hoga"" to that TA in Computation physics) and mere marks agar tumhara aas paas hai toh fir tension nahi hoti this (Exception: Compilers ;p). SPO Internship season me bhi tumne kaafi support kiya tha mujhe and I remember jab meri research internship ka news share kiya tha you were genuinely happy about me. 

In contrast to what you might think, you have a much better work ethic than me. I have seen your drive and the extent to which you are ready to go once you fixate your mind on something. That's something I have been inspired by and will continue to be even in the future.

Last sem chill karte Football, Tech discussions aur aapke  Conan, James Corden, Key and Peele ke recommendations ke saath and maybe some life gyaan bhi. Waise toh tum apne plans share nahi karte until the very end, but because of your intense drive, it is a given that you are going to be one of my most chappu dost. I am sure sooner or later you will also start dabbling with Quantum and I will be very happy to collaborate. Anyways, we are definitely going to keep in touch and I will try my best to keep this friendship intact for as long you can endure me.

You could feel the nervousness among the people that had just changed their batch. Then there's this guy. Curly hair, just woken up, about 20 mins late in a 50 mins test and then casually walking up to his seat. I think you took a good 5 mins before you realized there was a test going on. Cut to the results, the next day and what do you see?

I love chatting with you whenever I get a chance and am really sad that we missed that chance in our last sem.
