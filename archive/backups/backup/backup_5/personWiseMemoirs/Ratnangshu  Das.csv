Chalta firta imdb h tu. Wing cricket se leke bulla sessions. You have given us a lot of memories to cherish. From Psych to the classic ""nimbu --> dahi"" jokes, you have given us a lot of laughs.

And I have huge respect for you. You were the butt of many of our jokes, but you gracefully handled all of them, which not a lot of people can do. So keep up the good spirit and hopefully jldi kisi trip pe milenge.",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a63cf1819323d199d48c88,Aditya
