Bhai I can say Mse ka sabse studious boi hai tu . Har course mai front seat pe baith ke puri class dhyaan se sunna , doubts puchna jo ki profs bhi Kai baar nahi bata paate the. 

I hope humne jaise fickle mindedly time/IMS Mai select kiya tha hum apne Baaki life decisions waise nah le 😅😅.

There are so many great memories with you starting with orientation jab tu din Mai hi taare dikha deta tha Hume 😂😂.  Also playing football with you was fun you always have your 100 percent and that save you did was epic. D216 Mai mini militia kaafi memorable tha. 
But my heart still aches when you hung upon me and ditched us when we came to Kota to meet you 😔😔.

Subject : Tum aache ho aur bahut bade Madarchod bhi 

Dear Harshit,
It was a very good time of around 3 years which we had spent together.Tu nahi hota toh the fun quotient of the  wing would have dropped significantly. I remember the first sem ka Harshit jo rota rehta tha and since then there was no looking back uske baad toh bas daase aur pranks aur masti hi hai to look forward. I hope ab tu kabhi bhi life mai flight tickets bina destination dekhe nahi bharega. My most proudest moment of IITK is still jab maine samu aur bandar ke saath milke teri cycle upar pahucha di thi. Also thanks verma boi for teaching me and samu ESC201 5 minutes before quiz and yes teri treat pending mai next jab milte toh dunga . Yaad hai kaise humne  sabko Atop pe pahucha diya tha and apan dono A206 aur A204 le liye the. 
Last sem was fun. Those among us nights, poker nights, Frisbee nights ;),  that Upmanyu ka show jaha apan sab gif mai convert ho gae the . Last but not the least the parties jaha # kanuumerikanuu #Tpkobulao and #AkshatMadarchod famous hue the . I still don't know maine kya kiya tha to deserve that. I have our paths cross again. 


Till that P**ma Lmao

Thank You,
Dota

11,"Bhai tere ko better jaane ka mauka I got during lock down . It was fun preparing together for CAT.  Tere dedication and hard work I have seen both on the tennis court and during cat prep. You were the most regular players on the tennis court and I have seen your game improve immensely. Maine Teri forehand ki itne tarif Suni hai ki Del Porto type hai tera forehand 😅😅. I really wanted to play with you but wahi last sem thodi health issue tha toh court kaam aaya but jab bhi next mauka milega we will play.
Playing basketball with your wing that day was fun.
Stay connected bro and do well",Akshat  Agrawal,True,60c242aa659165b3aa645d0f,Maloo  Hardik
12,"Yo MSE bro it was fun preparing for exams and quizzes with you . I remember tu Mai aur Abhishiek Sharma were always the last 3 people to enter the exam hall apni prep last moments pe hi hoti thi. Teri mess ki royalty yaad rahegi ki Pure hall ke liye alag khana banta tha and Ramji ke liye alag.
Bhai had a good time with you specially during last semester . Bhai tera music ka taste and passion kaafi sahi hai keep that going and stay in touch.",Akshat  Agrawal,True,60c24be8659165b3aa645ea7,Ramji  Gupta
13,"We got to know each other from the Freshers inferno Initially I was a bit envious as everyone was like Batra header goal bhi maar raha, swimming Mai bhi phaad raha, Badminton Mai bhi chaap raha and I didn’t get to play TT and football games due to clashes. But soon after getting to know you I was happy ki yeh tennis nahi khelta 😛.  Playing football/ volleyball with you and Dtop was fun but playing against your wing uska mazza kuch aur hi tha.( inter wing semis ki loss was due to umpiring errors even you know it ). Also stop crediting your theory of negativity for us reaching the IFL semis it was the team that made it possible . 

I don’t know whether you will be a quantum computationalist( not sure if that’s a word 😛), physicists , chef or god knows what  but jo bhi hoga you would be the best in that field. Bas jab bhi next mile don’t be a chutiya jaise abhi hai and keep playing.

Lock toothe hue tera faint hona humesha yaad rahega 😂😂.You were a philosopher by your thoughts and a very difficult person to convince or win an argument against 😛.But I enjoyed those discussions. Maine kai baar mazak banaya hoga tera lifestyle ka but your consistency and determination about everything from academics to lifestyle is really admirable. I hope jaha tu rahe waha humesha doodh aur dahi ki nadiyaa bahe 😂😂.Aur ladki ke baap se haath maangne ke bajae panjaa lagao ge maath puch lena 😅.

Dhaula I really miss the Goa trip kyuki I wanted to see a person traveling in Delhi metro in Goa clothes. I remember how during exams 3-4 people used to be in your room and tu aaram se padh bhi leta tha aur unhe padha bhi deta tha I really admired that quality of yours . You were one of the most helpful people around, always ready to help anyone in need.
Last month to special tha hi we played among us, poker, badminton had lots of parties and you managed to be a part of all that despite your internship. I know you have a very bright future bas hum sab d-mid waalo ko mat bhul  jaana aur Zomato ke coupons bhi bhejte rehna 😅😅😅.
Also party karte rehna kyuki tumhe toh chadti hi nahi 😛😛
