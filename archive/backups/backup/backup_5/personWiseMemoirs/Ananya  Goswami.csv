Hey Akshay, if I had to say who is the most enthusiastic person in IITK I would definitely say your name. Be it a small get together, birthday planning or a 7-day trip, your enthusiasm is super infectious. There are so many memories with you that a memoir can’t be filled with them all. Although my favourite is when we inadvertently took Hemant’s counselling session and the dinner in Liquid afterwards XD I remember in first year when you first gave me that lamp as a birthday gift even before my birthday, things like that and all your efforts you put, with the biggest smile on your face too, into your friendships are just amazing to me. Faizan was absolutely right that evening in Goa, people don’t appreciate you enough. Being guilty of that myself, I wanna tell you how important you are to me and the group.
Also, I hate that I had to miss your sister’s wedding for that stupid quiz, I do regret that a lot. I’m also amazed at your passion for SAE, regardless of personal or academic commitments, you’ve put the team first and that’s extremely admirable. Anyway, we still have had a lot of fun in our time and I know we’ll continue to do so! We’ll meet soon! 
P.S. Love your mocktails and cocktails ofc and that pasta we cooked remember? Lol fun times <3

I remember being utterly shocked on seeing the calm person I had been sitting beside for the past week dancing on “Laila main laila” like a star on the orientation stage. We did become great friends after that, thanks to Kush’s grand treat :P First year outings will always be super memorable and special for me because of you <3 You and Abhishek have been there for me on so many of my lowest points and have always managed to make me feel better in a short while, be it in 3rd semester in CCD or that walk in front of CS in 4th semester. Equally amazing have been the fun, lighter moments, like watching you dance at prom, making a rangoli with you on Diwali, going to your open mic, celebrating new years getting hammered with you guys or just randomly hanging out. There are literally so many memories, I can’t do justice to all of them here. It’s been amazing knowing you all and seeing you bond in a way that is really something out of this world. The image of watching you all cry (and Kushagra trying to :P) after your heart wrenching poem that evening in front of Hall 13 canteen will always be imprinted in my heart. You’ve always been the alpha, the leader of the pack but seeing you get emotional, something which was so in contrast with your usual fun-loving and sunny nature, was something that shook me up from inside and made the imminent departure quite real :( Thanks for that poem though, I hope you really get it out in video format like you were planning to, it’ll always remind of our time at IITK. Thanks for being a great friend and I know we’ll keep in touch. Whenever you feel low, just know I’m one text or call away. Love you loads!

And I’m not counting your “assessments” of the group, okay?  Wo layover wala plan ho raha hai, mujhe kuch nahi pata. Lockdown me tujhse hi sabse zyada baatein hui hai meri. You were the one who knew everything going on in my life, and I knew everything in yours.

I do wish we had met sooner, campus memories aur banate saath me. But we have time, I need you to always remember that. Indore nahi to Gurgaon/Bangalore zaroor milenge. Hormonal Wifey ke saath aur fights jo karni hai mujhe XD What I love the most about us is that we may fight like little kids but at the end of the day, I’ll have your back and you’ll have mine <3 The text you wrote on DUGC fam was the only time you made me both teary and speechless, so thanks for that, it meant a lot to us.

I remember the events of that November and I felt so sad for you ofc but I felt so glad that you felt safe enough with me to confide in me and I was able to comfort you in some way. Remember I took you to the Ganpati pooja in the community centre and it turned out to be so much fun! Also, yaad hai tujhe Hall 6 ka bolne lage the log? XD I remember PHY102 endsems ke pehle ki shaam, I was sick and you came to teach me, you do such amazing things for your friends and basically give it your all, that’s something I’ve always admired about you. Also, your devotion for your family is really enviable, they’re lucky to have you as a son. We might have drifted apart afterwards but that doesn’t mean we can’t still steer our ships towards each other again? Let’s keep in touch and all the best!

I’m always gonna remember that walk we had around OAT when you were intoxicated and we both were broken hearted and how great of a listener you are. Then on the trip that followed, you helped me get through it just by being there for me and making sure I was having fun. Loved the fish spa though, didn’t you? :P Also, thanks for making me my first drink ever and making sure I had fun that night, it’s one of my best memories ever! I remember on Pichola Lake when Faizan played that song and I guess we all got emotional but I started crying, you hugged me and made me feel that it was okay to not be okay then. I think about that moment a lot, whenever I think of that trip. You always have created a safe space for me to vent out and be real, can’t thank you enough for that. I miss your presence a lot and I really regret the fact that we didn’t hang out much in the latter parts of our campus life, I guess we both got a bit busy with our lives. I hope to amend that soon.

I remember when I told you about my breakup, you didn’t understand how to handle such situations but you were still sensitive and caring enough to make me feel safe and cared for. I never felt judged by you and that’s a big thing considering you’re so chapu and the fact that we were in IITK XD I remember you were somehow always in your corridor and we used to have a chat before I went to Shreyash’s room. You were tracking me, weren’t you? :P I always had this Sheldon-like image of you and I’m extremely glad that you felt comfortable enough with me to share the Leonard parts with me too! I’m sorry you had to go through that, I can say from personal experience it’s not pretty. But you’re incredibly strong and you powered through and grew throughout it. I’m proud of you for that. Baaki aapke lame jokes and puns ke kya kehne XD Also, I really admire your work ethic and productivity, it must not be easy and I have no idea how you do it.
