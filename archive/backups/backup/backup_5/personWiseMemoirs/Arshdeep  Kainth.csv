But let me rephrase it, I've seen you grow in a thousand ways throughout our time. You've been such a great friend, brother and roommate. Yaad hai jab teri aur Sanjay ki ladayi ho jaati thi, in first year, fir mujhe tum log judge bna dete the, to resolve it. I'm really lucky ki mujhe tere jaisa roommate mila tha first year mein. Let's hope yr jaldi se apne milen, it's been such a long time.
Chal, chalenge kabhi eksaath kahin ghoomne, tab tak ke liye, take care bro!
See ya!",Arshdeep  Kainth,True,60c0e27b659165b3aa645265,Aman  Gautam
1,"Hey Anu, when we first met, little did I know that we'd go such a long way into friendship. We've had so much fun together, it's almost impossible to explain all the things we've been through. I'm definitely gonna miss your sassy and fun sense of humor. Best of luck for coming years. Hope that our bond remains the same in coming years too.
Wish we meet real soon :)
Until then, Adios !",Arshdeep  Kainth,True,607d79bab38952bbfbc68fa5,Ananya  Goswami

10,"Yo bitch, well I had to think A LOT of what to write, but then thought that I should just start writing :)
We've been through so much that it's hard to condense it all into a memoir (Also, given my remembering power, lol).
I remember meeting your mom the very first day at Hall 3, and later coming over to your room, seeing you there, sitting on the bed without mat in a corner. I had no idea that we'd be bonding soo well.
Those long hours of binge watching shows together with lights off to get the cinematic feels, playing games together, bitching and laughing at every fucking thing! Those pizza king (or king of pizza) maina orders we ate, then when we couldn't finish it, trying to find anyone who could lol. Yaad hai voh RM mein poora din pade rehte the, especially during summers. Oh bhai, this is really nostalgic. I was really lucky to have such an awesome friend, brother and roommate.
You really are my brother from another mother!
Keep up those positive vibes and that one hell of a confidence man. May you reach everything you aim for in future.
PS. Covid khatam hote hi Ahmedabad aa rha mein, for sure.
Bye until then.
Take care bro.
Cheers!",Arshdeep  Kainth,True,60a6114a819323d199d489e9,Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai
