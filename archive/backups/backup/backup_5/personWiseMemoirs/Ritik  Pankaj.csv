It's been a very very nice and beautiful company with you either on trip or on campus. One thing I learnt from you is not to give someone extra f*ck to any particular things, just let be as it's going.

And I remember once the Nun tragedy of ""Rave Moti"" and ""Rave 3"" XD. Seriously that day your face was mostly horrified just because of tempo charge than the movie as the first time in planning, your calculation went wrong. But still, that was my kind of surprise when I saw Vaibhav Aggarwal ( that was the most horrific thing in that movie theatre). Your dance skill with Hemant is still a turu lob & your PUBG skill is just great. Well, most of the time in gully cricket my second most wicket-taker where you( first is always Ashokii).

We are very thankful to Arun that he adopt you in exchange of Abhit( this deal was really worth it)

Still, there are so many things to learn from you and so many things needs to taught you. In the upcoming journey, I wish we went on an abroad trip until that I hope I'll get my driving license :p .

I really regret the 2nd year part jaha baar-baar mujhe SAE ke karan na bolna pad jata tha but although jab bhi moka milta tha, tab pel ke mazze karte the. Lala ji ko humesa pump up karna jab apne room se bedakhal ho jata tha! mutthu ke query solve karna ya Dinner Nimantran ka wait karna ye sab pata nahi age kab moka milega firse, 
but Prabhu yaar dill se dhanyawad tumko, kyoki mere Head Design ke journey tumhare bina kabhi pura nahi hota, most of the time tumhare imagination/suggestion pe meri design ready hoti thi and I had observed ki meri first year, first interaction wali design se Head design ke safar main kafi improvement hui hai XD.
