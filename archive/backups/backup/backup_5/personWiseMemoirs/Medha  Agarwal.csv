0,"I know you are everyone's Sontu but IDK why I think I have spent more time calling you Chotu, just for the irony of it. 
Yaar first year would have been impossible without you. Sab saath mein kiya - padhai, ELS, TA, aero, and of course A-603 ki mastiya.  ""Medha tumhare room mein bois hai"" always cracks me up, but it was so true; tu hota toh that hamesha. Thanks for getting me through ESC101; you know all about my syntax errors. You'll be glad to know woh abhi bhi hai. SC-II ki labs mein same harkate karti thi :P
I'll miss those Antaragini nights, random NH-91 dinners, and of course OAT hangouts. Those two years wouldn't have been fun without you.

I know we grew very much apart after the second year. To an extent, ki jab campus mein the toh samajh nahi aa raha that ki kya hi bolu. I am sorry for the distance. If I could go back in time, maybe I'll try to fix some mistakes. I knew you as the guy jo MTH mere se padhke, mere se zyada number lata ha and look what you have achieved now. Just keep paddling upwards like this. Kya yaar, I recall Goa mein apna drunk heart to heart interrupt ho gaya that. Koi nahi, another time!

I hope we meet again and relive those fun ""boondi ke laddu wali ice cream"" nights in Bangalore again. ",Medha  Agarwal,True,60a6abf6819323d199d49174,Aditya  Sonthalia
1,"Yo God! 
Yaar to this day I can't stop laughing at how much you resemble the Monkey King. I remember the first time Sonthalia introduced us, I took him away and whispered ""yaar yeh toh ekdum monkey king jaisa hai."" I remember how I crashed your and GJ's initial library date (when you weren't dating :P) and told her the monkey king thing. Thankfully, she didn't mind the similarity warna kya hi hota tera! :-)

I love how happy you always are and tend to dissipate that thing in every group. I have come out of our every conversation thoroughly amused and in complete awe of you. It was fun organizing GJ's birthday with you while you were fretting about doing the decorations all wrong. Chal I got a sick fire hazard story in return. Mujhe toh bohot maza aaya. 

I wish we could have interacted more on campus but jab bhi mile it was one memorable experience. Teri respect bhi bohot hai and tujhe dhamki bhi de rhi hoon - khayal rakhna meri bestie ka, bohot pitega warna. I really wish we meet again sometime. At least Singapore ghuma toh dena hi whenever I visit.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60a6a160819323d199d49139,Anany  Sharma

In Class XI, I saw a curly-haired guy who'd walk into my class during breaks and goof around like anything. It's a shame that we did not talk then, to the extent that until the time we found each other getting drenched in the rain during orientation, I didn't even know you were coming to IITK! Never did I know that that guy would turn out to be the best (and very insane) brother I could have ever asked for. The campus wouldn't have been half as fun as it was without you. 

Before making you all weepy by recalling our best memories, I need to say this - you have such a unique influence on your friends that makes them jump up from their inertia-seats and do some Bhavy-fun. I appreciate how you lift my spirit even in the worst times and make every problem look insignificant. I know we have had our fair share of RR, but some unsaid understanding of 'this shall pass' between us makes us joke about them while being knee-deep in life's shit. It is insane how at one moment you are this idiotic chotu who makes me facepalm at a frequency of 50 Hertz, and at the next moment, you are talking sense into me like a zindagi-ke-dard--know-it-all. After six years of knowing about your existence and three years of 'knowing' you, I can safely say that I love you enough that I am never letting you get rid of me.  Peace.

While you are supposed to reminisce your memories with someone here, I can't think of them in a finite number. But here are some campus ones that are absolutely close to my heart - sending fifty-odd gaalis to each other every day for absolutely no reason, helping you out when you were getting your ass kicked in PSO and pulling those all-nighters, bouncing into you in RM every day, our trips (with much-loved third-wheeling :-), and of course Hall-5 badminton. Remember how you highjacked that king-sized bed I wanted in Kochi? For the sake of other readers' sanity, I am going to skip the part where I talk about the methodology employed, but man, you skipped death that day. 

Surviving lockdown would have been impossible without you. I would always look forward to us randomly crashing each others' place. From the first (and a very awkward :-) visit to my place to multiple weekly visits during the lockdown, and finally, to me crashing at your place for some 15 odd fucking days, it is incredible how you are the first person who comes to mind whenever I am sad and need some cheering up. You made the college end not suck and even fun with all the karaoke, Bipasha, patte-sutta, jooooms, and my cutting-edge cooking. It was fun man. Thank you for being you.

P.S.: You lost it super easy on the dinner bet. Kya paneer ki toh season kara that :) Anyways, looking forward to it!",Medha  Agarwal,True,60c233a8659165b3aa645b23,Bhavy  Singh
