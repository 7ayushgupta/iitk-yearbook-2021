First year me to kitni baar tere room pe aise hi aa jaata tha....mostly khane ke liye 😅. Aur first yr summers me ek baar to mai aur mrigank bhook se tadap rhe the aur phir aapke canteen se laye hue aachaar paranthe ne bacha liya tha 🙌. Aur haan aloo fry and honey chilly potato is 🧡.  
Mere school friend (jisko jaanta bhi nhi tu), tune essentially uski job lagwa di bhai....aap itne hepful hai. Acha lagta hai bolne me ki I have a friend who has 6 star rating. Future me coding tips lene tere paas hi aunga 😅. Baaki all the best yaar aur jaldi hi milte hai hopefully 🧡.

1,"Hey man! Had a lot of fun interacting with you in the first year. Remember those CHM labs 😅. All the best yaar and hopefully, we'll meet someday 🧡.  ",Hargun Preet Singh Bhatia,True,60c25a45659165b3aa646112,Ayush Hitesh Soneria
2,"Ayushk, where do I even begin? During the initial days, I distinctly remember someone telling me in mess that there are 2 CSE students in our wing, both named Ayush 😆. Soon enough, we met and became close friends. The more I got to know you, the more I was in awe of your skills and talent. One of my favourite things to do on campus was to randomly barge into your room, and explore all the stuff you had in the room, while you were sitting on your bed the entire time 😂.

Not only did you help me in several courses (special mention: TA101 and Crypto 😅), but you were perhaps the only one who patiently listened to all my math shit, from Goodstein's theorem to Vector bundles. Not to mention the time during HSS pre-registration, when you, me and Anshul were busy discussing p*rn and other things, and then, a couple of minutes before the deadline, I realised that my Pingala has auto-logged out with the preferences not being saved. You then came to my rescue with your God-level typing speed 🙏 and filled out the preferences. 

We have so many fun memories yaar, from the petty food fights in the first year 😅 to standing outside the ENG class for arriving late (your fault there 😝). And, of course, that wild Antarigini night! Loved those Pizza nights and canteen hangouts. Masala maggi pe bhi extra masala add karwata tha tu 😂. Seriously though, you are simultaneously one of the most humble and intelligent guy I have met. Your intense dedication and excellent work ethic have always been a source of inspiration for me. I will always cherish your friendship and the great memories we had. It's unfortunate that we couldn't meet in the last sem (sorry for that 😔). Wish you all the best, and hope to see you soon 🧡.

3,"Harshit bhai! Mereko to tu CHM lab se hi yaad hai 😅. Koi bhi experiment dhang se nhi hota tha humse 😆. Kitne hi courses me humne ek doosre ki help ki hai. Mera to koi exam khatam hota tha, mai tereko dhundta tha discuss karne ke liye 😅. Aur sabse jyada memorbale to crypto tha. Tereko maine almost jabardasti course register karaya ek group partner dhundne ke liye 😛. Aur phir to kaafi maza aya uske assign karne me (not the exams though 😂). 

You are intelligent, humble, hardworking and most importantly, you are ready to help anyone without any hesitation. Also, itni baate hoti thi hamari but maine tereko kabhi bhi gaali bolte nhi sune (kaise bhai?? )...aur na hi kabhi gussa hote 🙏. Wish you all the best man and hope to see you soon 🧡.",Hargun Preet Singh Bhatia,True,60c2311a659165b3aa645ad3,Harshit  Garg
4,"The Chill + Sophisticated guy!
I clearly remember the time, in our first year, when Ayush challenged us that we cannot hack into his FB account, and you just calmly took a video of him entering the password 😆.  You tolerated me many times when I was in your room having random conversations with Ayush (even on your bed!). Thanks for that 😅.  I feel like we have quite different personalities and nature (even though we do share DOB 😂), and it always seemed to me that I need to learn lots of life skills from you 🙏. All the best yaar and hope to meet you soon. 🧡",Hargun Preet Singh Bhatia,True,60c24148659165b3aa645cd2,Jatkar Soham Devidas
5,"Raja beta te do chante!  
Mess chalna? Kya? Nhi? Aah! Private video :P

Seriously though, had quite a bit of fun with you. Kaafi understanding wala banda hai tu....mere weird emotional rr sunne ke liye thanks :P 

Hopefully, kabhi milte hai!

6,"Abhi hai library me...aaja :P
1st year me Vijyoshi camp se lekar ab tak kaafi change aa gya tere me xD
Tu jo topics pe discussion karta tha, although mujhe thodi vichitr lagti thi teri baate (aur probably baad me samajh aye) but i feel usse kuch naye persepective mile. 
And 204/403 ka to endsem yaad hi hoga :P
All in all, you are good-natured, humble, easy to talk to nd tum emotions to ache se padh hi lete. 

Hopefully, non-virtually milenge kabhi! 

P.S. Thoda course ke liye bhi padh liya kariye :P ",Hargun Preet Singh Bhatia,True,60a6bc98819323d199d49197,Saurab  Jain
