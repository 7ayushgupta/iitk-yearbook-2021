We have been friends since we came here #ChooseBeta 😂(his id in minimilitia which we played)
If you wern't the part of our group we wouldn't have enjoyed this much. 
Itna enjoy karke bhi accha marks lata tha (pata nahi kaise electical ke bande itna chaapu hai) 
Hamare badminton, Raat main cards, vollyball, monopoly pata nahi kya kya khela hai ham log 😁,
OAT main baddy khelne ke liye sabse dependable banda tha tu or college jayenge toh i am sure rahega bhi. 
Ek or saal hai apne saath coding or masti saath main karenge bohot.
chal all the best for the future.

Nor you me

I am just chilling
and picking random names
and writing this poem
to memoir these beautiful times

we wrote an exam
the best there is
and spent our pass
of these four years

we fought for things
we read for hours
we played and made friends
this was best time of ours

Ham logo ka gang ka second most responsible banda( ofcourse first is me 😛) ka title tujhe main aaj de raha hu 😂. Ham logon ka trip rajasthan wala, Monopoly raat teen tak, Patte raat bhar jo khel te the, kabhi nahi bhulunga main . May be these are not the best years of my life acadamically but have been the most fun with you and our people in my whole life.
Thanks bro for being there for me always.

16,"The most Irresponsible and talented guy i have ever seen. Being your roommate for 3 years we ppl(all 10) have enjoyed so much but when we went over line and wanted to play one more game you were the guy who normally stopped. 
We will spend another year together(if this corona permits) but the memories we have spent together the minimilitia we played together and every other game you were the one guy whom i would say i had the most fun playing with as you were equally strong to me in most of them.
You excelled in cricket and studies which mattered the most. 
It was nice knowing you bro! 
Best wishes
