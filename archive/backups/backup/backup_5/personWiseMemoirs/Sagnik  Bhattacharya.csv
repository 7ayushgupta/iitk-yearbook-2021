0,"….And aaj maine apna yearbook dekha ❤️… so first year was all about “Aditya WiFi on karde mujhe magaai karna hai” …second year was all about internship and data structured classes XD, third year was about career discussions and fourth was about COVID…well no, first was about getting to know this person jo humesha class se direct C305 aake baithta hai(u even told one of your friends your room is C305 lmao), second year was all about that 2019 summer when we spent endless hours at either ours or Saksham’s rooms taking “preparation” and cracking dirty jokes… third was about seeing you mature up …that transformation from “is internship mein mazaa nahi aayega” to “main almost sure tha offer aa jayega”…until the shit of a pandemic separated us… well, be the amazing “bhosdiwaala” (Mihir’s words) that u are …. And we are gonna fucking stay connected whether you like it or not….lots of love ❤️❤️",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60a7a0ab819323d199d49281,Aditya  Gupta
1,"The idiosyncrasies of mine were put to use on you the very first week we quite fortuitously met, and thanks to your innocence they did but exacerbate the situation. To a great extent it produced the sensation of mirth, and my fastidiousness towards being didactic ""by scandalizing"" of course. It was in the months that followed that I discovered your diffidence, and your helpful nature rendered our initial exchanges ephemeral. It did span out to involving discussions at the Hall 5 Canteen over my upcoming B grades or the মনিকা situation, when your confession ""of not being able to sleep one whole night"" proved totally iconoclastic to the presumption of your nerdiness. Well, things did flow smoothly since then, with Microcap discussions or lab report exchanges, and it was very slow and natural for me to value the bond we developed as a capricious one. Believe you me, you were someone I always knew I could bank on, and so I did hours before EC lab exam, and still Mazhari f**ked me over with wave-shaping. Occasional discussions of astrophysics and dark matter, more lab report exchanges, my B grades and how I'd rue the day I joined IITK, and a caring friendly ear provided by you, did make up for one hell of a ride! Hope we meet soon!! ",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,False,60c2b3b0659165b3aa64619b,Debmalya  Sarkar
2,"Thanks for the immense patience you and Pulku showed me those first few months when I came up with innovative ways to send people out… and also putting up with my “daddy” issues…kidding aside, you always amazed me with your humility , and when everyone would leave my side or stay angry, I knew i could always rely on you; you are one of the most fun roomies one can hope for, and seeing you perform so elegantly on that “Antaragni Nukkad “ stage in your first year gave me so much pride… well that, has always been your talent, and your field now; may you reach new heights of success, and we will stay connected throughout( u don’t get a say in that) …lots of love Roomie ❤️❤️",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60a79f22819323d199d4927f,Rishabh  Ramola
3,"…And I write after you already gave me an earful on messenger…to be honest I gave the content much thought… and thought of coming up with something unique… failed ceremoniously… and am “back to basics” as you put it… despite whatever fights we have had… I can say without a shred of doubt that you are my best friend at IITK, and a real weird one at that….so, if I walk down that “memory lane” which we so serendipitously took the resolve to always tread together… all that comes to mind is the first day when those shitty seniors made us sit on the floor …. There I remember saying to you “ami sagnik Mukherjee bole ekjon achhe jantam and tor face ta chintam but didn’t correlate”…and u did that very stupid “mama” waala expression (don’t do that it creeps me out till date)… fast forwarding to our endless magaai at CC before the first semester exams….down to the different excuses you made to Pushkar before locking the door so that I could cry about feeling homesick… to the first trip home we took together and my WhatsApp ploys on “Oder dujon ke amader lower berth gulo dibina” (and you violating that , always being the good guy)… to our first dramatic fallout because of Ornob reasons XD … to our pathways getting slowly separated because of our interest areas, yet still hitting new “highs” of magaai the night before TA202… to our second dramatic fallout because of what I don’t remember…. to the days of you coming into my room moment after my coming out article was published, saying “aagun lagiye dili toh”…. to the tense days of the internship season… and to our third fallout from which we didn’t recover soon enough…. I did write you that letter, in my defence, you didn’t write back until COVID came😒…. And then…then it was just COVID … so here I am, looking at my masterful recollection of our “cute” moments, laughing in glee and thinking of staying connected throughout life by or against your wishes, thinking what I wrote was a real tearjerker ❤️❤️",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60a79d41819323d199d4927d,Sagnik  Mukherjee
