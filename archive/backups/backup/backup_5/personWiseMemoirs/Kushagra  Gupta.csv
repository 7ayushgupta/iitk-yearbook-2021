0,"I remember the first walk I had in IITK, it was with you, figuring out the way to the airstrip. Tabhi se feel aa gayi thi ki bohot genuine banda hai, and this is the kind of people I want to meet here. It's been a long journey since, one that I've had the privilege to share with you. We've shared goals, dreams and ambitions, but the thing I'll remember the most is being able to share the truth with you. You may not think of it as much, but genuinely bohot kam log milte hai jinnke sath you can actually be yourself. I believe in you bhai, you just need to build the same confidence in you about yourself. Math ka RR to hum dono hi bhoolna chahte hai, so I won't recollect that here. What I want to cherish is our shared aspirations, our countless efforts chasing it and our shared dreams which we're going to achieve sooner rather than later.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a3df56819323d199d47fb8,Aakash  Khandelwal
1,"Bhai! Can't even begin, or hope to capture the moments I've shared with you, yearbook mei itni capacity hi nahi hai. College ki pehli daru se leke akhri tak (I made it a point not to drink after you left), canteen ke kebab parantha se leke Goa ke kaju tak, first year ke kattapa se leke...kattapa to tu abhi bhi hai XD, college ke some of the best experiences I've had the privilege of living with you. I'm terribly poor at first impressions, but thank god I was right about you, you bright bundle of positive energy. Even though NN was making us laugh, you've been the one to make me smile. In some of my darkest times in IITK, teri koi faltu bakchodi ya impossible plan was enough to remind me what's good in life, a random visit to your room was enough to remind me ki jitna bhi haggu I'll always have the best place to return to. Honestly, you've been the glue to our group, wo fevicol ka jod jo dosti jodta chala gaya. If I use the IITK lingo of bhai in it's truest sense, you shine as the best example of it. If ever you need me, if ever you make a plan, count me in, cause it's not about the place, it's about the people ( ;) ). This is not goodbye!

2,"Smartest person on campus, hands down (I include the profs too XD)! With that out of the way, thanks for all the memories and support man! I really appreciate it. I can't think of any other person to share the coordiship of Pclub with, and if it wasn't for times when we had to just grind thorugh it, the club would've failed. You've been the best coordinator the club has seen, atleast in my eyes (and that's a big compliment given the history). But you go way beyond that, I've always been in awe whenever I've worked with you, be it competing in Inter IIT, discussing topics people will understand only after 150 years, working through making problems or lectures, designing a Tshirt or even simply playing board games. I've always felt a certain ease when hanging out with you, and maybe that's why it was special for me. I'll cherish our talks cycling to and fro to RM, movie screening and board games in astro club, our discussions (literally everywhere), our 'trip' to Bombay, shared lunches and dinners (pizzas have never tasted the same outside Sandy's room) and most importantly, everything I've learnt from you. See you soon in Cali mate, we've yet to conquer Disneyland!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a4384f819323d199d48102,Aditya  Gulati
3,"Bsdk! Sorry, couldn't start your memoir without this. Let me start this memoir with an apology you deserve, tu humara personal punching bag tha but you stood strong through all of it. Can't think of a more fun or interesting person I've ever met, or imagine college life being what is was without you! And honestly speaking, you're one of the few people I cherish the most meeting here, so definitely US to leke jaa raha hu tujhe bhale hi bag mei bharke leke jana pade...can't imagine life being fun without you being in it. We all know tu bohot hi zyada smart hai, but what I want to talk about is how supportive and good-hearted you've been. Thode matlabi to sab hote hai XD, but the effort I've seen you putting for others (man it goes way beyond giving coding tests for others) is astonishing. Although life ki practicality mei kafi hagga hai tune (kabhi bag cinema hall mei bhoolna, kabhi phone, and wallet and ID card to bhagwan jane kaha hai)...but the way you've conducted your four years here, from your ideology towards it to your logic for living it, are closest to perfection. Your strength of character is astounding, jitne mazze humne tere liye I can't think of anyone else who could have faced it with a smile, and still be the buzzing, brilliant happy-feet. Know this for a fact mate that jitna devotion and dedication tune apni friendship mei dikhaya hai for all of us, utna hi hum bhi reciprocate karte hai tere liye. 'Aap -aap' karte hue 4 saal to nikal hi liye tune, ab Google bhi jaa raha hai..you're well on track on your plan to be the next CEO xd. Even after all our first year debates, fight club brawls and fifa el clasico's, you're the first person I would stand up for on campus. Although first year mei humne tujhe duniyadari sikhane ka try kiya ho, I will say this..never change.

You're one of the most fun people to have a conversation with and a really cool person to hang out with (even the sober me agrees). We've shared loads of stuff, from our branch, halls, debates and Vox to bongs, our love for beef, hijacking trains, sutte and drunkard dance steps. Convocation in Goa was extremely fun minister! And I'm thrilled to have had you as my Hobbes. It sometimes feels like you're one of the most wrongly judged people in hall 2, but I feel like I know you much better now, having shared a convocation at Goa and a very tipsy return to college.

5,"King of all trades man! IITK ka sabse talented banda hands down! I only really met you in 2021, but the fact that I've come to appreciate so much about you in such a short time speaks tons about your sheer brilliance. Masterchef Goa, Kanpur ka Da Vinci, Senna of SAE and a really sweet person. Thank you for introducing me to F1 mate. I'll forever cherish our memories in Goa..Hemant ki shadi, hijacking trains, almost being arrested, swimming with the fishes, living dangerously on Goa roads, impossible dark room games, perfect snacks and coffee, the best rum after a long trek..the list is endless.

I'll never forget our beginning in Antaragni, but what followed was more than memorable.

7,"Pranam prabhu! Aapki aarti likhte likhte memoir pe aa gaye hai. From literally seeking your blessings before exams in the first sem to the final hug before leaving IITK, you've been an integral part of my stay at IITK. You are the person I respect the most in IITK, and it never fails to amaze me how you always know the right thing to do, whatever the situation might be. I honestly wouldn't have believed that a perfect blend of understanding, smartness, kindness, courage, fun, wit, creativity, charm, humour, insight, personability, confidence, empathy, adventure (running out of adjectives here) could have existed, but you proved me wrong. From our first interaction on the mess table in the first sem to goodbyes of the last month, I knew I was talking to someone special. You've always been the strength of the group (including fight club XD) while also being the most comforting presence with an easy and charming laugh.  We have often shared moments of understanding, where a slight of the eye or a mid-sentence pause or a passing reference communicated what words could not, and the fact you could do this with anyone is a one in billion quality (and so are you!). I'll admit it, I was a little envious of you initially, but that quickly changed into awe, love and respect. You've been a constant inspiration for me, and I owe a lot of my transformation at IITK to learning from you. After all, who better to model yourself from than a guy who's seemingly perfect at everything. Your friendship means a lot to me, and one of the few times I've felt the freedom to be my genuine self have been while talking to you. Thank you for listening to me and accepting me during those times, I hope I can someday explain how important those moments have been. Bhoolne ka to sawal hi nahi uthta, I'm never finding anyone like you anywhere I may travel. All the best for your future mate, know that someone will always be in your corner whatever the situation (I've learnt this from the best ;) ).",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60bfdfe6659165b3aa645149,Anany  Sharma
8,"Hello the-person-I-regret-not-interacting-more-with XD. I'll take this memoir to express my appreciation and gratitude, something which I may never have done but something you definitely deserve. You're one of the most good-hearted, understanding, caring, and hardworking people I've had the privilege to meet. Even though we never got to have night out walks or heart-to-heart conversations, I've always found your presence to be comforting, and I've always felt like I can talk to you about anything. I guess you can call it friendship at first sight XD. Our memories go far and scattered across four years, but what I'll remember you is watching you being the best person in IITK. I'll remember walking into Abhishek's room and finding you consoling him, or meeting you outside CCD being a great friend to Ankit, or always being there for Hemant, and these are the moments that have defined you for me. You inspire me with your dedication to go that extra mile for things you care about, be it your friends or CWC or simply your point of view. You've always been supportive of me, and encouragement from you is extra sweet because I know it's coming from an amazing person. If it were up to meet and the rules permitted, I'd nominate you for every Gymkhana award there is.  We still have time before we get busy with life outside IITK, we'll do everything we missed on our next trip. 

P.S. - I hope the shirt reminds you of our friendship.

It's been awesome being one of the six rational people in debate rooms with you, watching your incredible journey to become one of the best we have to offer (also, beating Arnav in NUJS was oh so satisfying). You had some great ideas for the club, and I would've loved to see them become a reality. You've had a roller coaster of a journey at IITK, and I'm glad to have shared some of its highs (quite literal highs, bhand Ojha iz da best [1][2][3][4]). But despite all your antics, the dedicated and diligent Ojha is a force to be reckoned with. I've been a huge fan of your 'that's what your mommy said' moments, and your wise-ass one-liners crack me up every time. Keep to your brilliant best man, I am waiting for you to figure out where you want to make your mark cause you're just too talented not to make it big.

I'll remember you for the late-night winter camp sessions (and yashsriv giving me your messenger nickname), NYO discussions on turtle porn, pizza parties on a train to Mumbai, getting robbed of shrimps by IITB fachhas, collecting chillar while singing in antaragni, anti bong movement in German classes, the one debate I was able to drag you to, riding the highs and lows of a difficult coordinatorship, and the 'very formal' tea parties. Although we drifted apart towards the end of our journey (primarily because of my stupidity), I'm glad we got to share so many experiences, and I hope to make new ones when we meet in the US.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c08fed659165b3aa6451b1,Anish  Saxena

We took longer than I expected to become friends (thanks to our awesome start), but I'm glad we finished with sharing joints (NOT the joints you put on cakes) rather than sharing scars. I've only recently come to discover how wonderful a person you are, and I'm happy for the times we got to spend together in 2021. Our walk in Goa wasn't exactly how I thought it would be, but I guess that goes for our friendship too. We've come a long way, from ignoring each other in chem lab to trying to extend our shared stay in Goa (thankfully not with the police). I don't care what anyone thinks, but I got the best gift in secret Santa because has the force with her my Santa. Cheers to our shared highs -- from moping the OAT stage on Holi to practically drowning in Mama-Mio shakes to almost breaking the first floor with our killer dance moves in Goa.

12,"Hey Avik! Thanks for helping me out at the starting man, I was lucky to be paired with you in NYO, and I can't thank you enough for how much I learnt from you at that time. Listening to you talk about Deep Dream motivated me to make a dream of my own. I knew that you were brilliant from the winter-camp (first sem se to chaap hi raha hai, your gradient ascent learning rate is not a number), and I only expected that you would ace it in the end. Discussing ML related stuff (yeah, most of it was one way with you pouring knowledge) was super fun, and left me wanting to work more after I could close my mouth from awe. But despite being one of the most chapu people I've ever met, thanks for always being available for help (CS 698 plag reacts only). Your stellar career is well matched by your humble self. We'll watch you climb to the top of your field, but please don't forget us minions at the summit(just kidding, you're too good of a person to do so).

14,"Hey :). Writing this memoir brings back a rush of memories, and I can't decide whether to be happy about having shared them or be sad that our journey at IITK is coming to an end. It almost makes me want to just be quiet, with a sly smile on my face while my mind churns at a hundred memories per minute. But I won't do that, for you've made me see otherwise. We've been friends for a long time now, so much so that we can't even remember how and where we started. It feels like you just eased into my life at some point and have been an essential cog in it ever since, and I find that fitting. Although our friendship has had its fair share of explosive moments, the experiences I cherish the most are the seamless conversations where your thoughts fit in perfect harmony with mine, where filters on my thoughts did not seem necessary for the first time in my life, where I helplessly ended up laying myself bare, and where I finally learnt to value myself as a person. The surge of emotions I've felt with you is something exceptional, from a sudden rush of heartbeat when we shared secrets I did not think my tongue would ever taste, to heartwrenching lulls when we reached an impasse. No experience with you was ordinary, for the connection we've shared is extraordinary. I may have already expressed my appreciation, but lest the future-you forget, you're a gem of a person, perhaps the best I've met in the last four years. 

If people see a friend in you, know that they see an image of the best of us. If people have walked away during the journey, maybe they just couldn't keep up with your brilliant best. Perhaps they realised that they could never reciprocate your dedication as a friend, and perhaps they knew that they do not deserve you and were too afraid to admit it. Even I've had difficulty coping up sometimes, wondering if I deserve someone as perfect as you, but afraid to forego what your friendship meant at the same time. I know that I haven't been the easiest person at all times, sometimes even exasperating myself over what I've done. Our numerous fights, debates and breaks (sometimes not so little) in friendship bear testament to that. Thank you for always being the bigger person through these times, for trusting in the best of me even when my actions brought out the worst in me. Sanderson has taught me a lot about the value of trust, and in you, I've seen this virtue come to life and blossom. 

You know better than most about some of my difficult moments in IITK (and your role in it! JK), but I think it's essential for you to realise your role (knowing or unknowing) in helping me overcome it too. During my 'revival' (shall we say), I've often wondered how Avisha would react to a situation, and more often than not, that has landed me at the right decision, or rather, a decision I was happy with. You've pushed me to be the best version of myself, and that has transformed me in ways that were unimaginable to me for the longest time, yet ways I had always yearned for. It's one of the greatest gifts I could've asked for, helping me in my fight against the silly thoughts in the back of my head, and giving me an anchor when everything was slipping away.  I think you realise how important that has been for me, and I hope that conveys how much I value you. When people acknowledge the change I've gone through, or appreciate me for being a good friend, know that I silently thank you for showing me the way.

I realise I've been droning on for a page without ever really beginning your memoir. I wanted to make it a grand gesture to thank you for everything and summarise our journey, but I realise we've never really been about grand gestures. It's always been the small things that made you stand out among the riches of wonderful people at IITK. Your weird questions in the middle of a serious conversation [1], your cat-like sneer at my idiosyncrasies [2], your excitement about little things [3], your intimate knowledge about every nook and cranny of IITK [4], and your insistent hatred for dogs [5] coupled with how easy you make talking about the most difficult of things, your infinite patience and willingness to give second chances, a level of maturity and strength of character that well exceeds your age, the faith upon which I could share anything with you, and your commitment to trust and understanding was just what I needed in a friend. Not grand gestures, but a continuous adherence to these virtues have nurtured our friendship, and that's what I'll commemorate it with. I'll admit I've been a bit clandestine with the memoir (neither the world nor I am ready for it yet), but I think you'll read between the lines (you always do). I don't know if I've come close to do justice to what I wanted to say, but I know that our conversations have.

15,"In case you've hidden the original certificate XD - 
This certificate is hereby issued in appreciation of the prolonged strange, erratic and otherwise twisted behaviour of Ayush Agarwal. Ayush has always been conscious of the environment, leading the 'khulle mei hagna band karo' campaign in IITK and going as far as dressing campus dogs with diapers. His social initiatives have been a constant source of inspiration, with his efforts to iron S Ghorai’s pants every day in MTH102 even prompting the teacher to wear the same pants daily (unwashed mind you). As a ‘responsible’ citizen of India, he made 69 arrests on valentine’s day with the ‘anti-Romeo squad’. He even volunteered as a day labourer for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Ayush has been an active resident of the campus, he bought the most Bournvita from DOSA and used it to run the ‘I’m a Complan boy’ campaign. We will never forget his efforts in eliminating the national threat of Akash Anand’s pet birds and his generous donation of hair on Word Blood Donor day. His achievements in writing the best Hindi ‘nibandh’ in ELS poetry slam and the national record he set for treating cycle punctures have made him immortal in the annals of history. Ayush has made an indelible impact on numerous young minds with his ‘Kalbelia’ performance in Y18 orientation and his famous debate sessions on ‘Mayawati vs Chhipkali’. His research output for the institute is invaluable, with his latest experiment on producing mutant ‘nilgai’ called ‘piligai’ (by painting them yellow, naturally) creating ripples in the scientific community. Ayush has consistently shown absurd behaviour, throughout his comical tenure at IITK, and this certificate commemorates his madness.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c9a145659165b3aa64630e,Ayush  Agarwal
16,"Ok, this is probably the toughest memoir I've had to write. The reason (which I'm sure you'll guess without me writing it) is simple, you know so much of what I'm thinking before I say it, understanding exactly where I'm coming from that I feel as baffled as GJ in a stats class when faced with a task to pen it down finally. Nonetheless, I'll try my best and trust you to follow the unsaid. I feel like I've met a different Ayush from what I've heard about, and I'm not talking about just the stuff that comes to mind first. I don't think that a lot of people understand you as a person (I lay no claim to the same), for I've known you to be as good a listener as Medha, as supportive as GJ, as heart-warming as Ananya, as understanding as Avisha and as easy to talk to as Dootika in your unique way. I'm glad to have experienced these different facets of you and still recognize a vibe unique to you, and man, does that speak of character! 

We share so much of our academic journey at IITK - crying over pure math courses, sharing seats in every class, figuring out Veritas on blackboards, solving late-night stats assignments, and conspiring over google docs in the online semesters. Attending classes was never the same without our constant whispers, without you teaching me a secondary lecture in parallel with the professors. So it's not a coincidence that the rise in my performance concurs with spending more time in your company. Couple this with our random walks around RM, exchange of ideas and music over chat and in-person, that one crazy special kulfi, stealing your hat from your room, and ultimate frisbee in the rains of Goa, and we have the foundation for a remarkable friendship. But what made it extraordinary was the connection I developed over these moments on so many levels, to the extent that you can finish my sentences and mirror my thoughts (those double and triple jinxes bear testimony). We've never had any significant friendship defining moments, but finding each other in our routine was implicitly doing that throughout our journey. Maybe that's why your friendship is so special to me, or perhaps it's the fact that I could see an impression of myself in you, significantly different in many ways and yet so similar. Maybe that's why I relish watching you succeed as much as I enjoy my triumphs, and why if it were anyone else who got into GSoC instead of me, it would have hurt. 

That last day in Goa was amazing, and I'm glad you asked me to stay when everyone else wanted me to go with them. Underlying this, I'm grateful for finally finding acceptance, for having found a niche with you, Medha and GJ after wandering for so long. Chilling on Curlies in Anjuna, that dark room cum pakdam-pakdai, letting our imagination run amok on trippy windowpanes, I would gladly stop time at any of these moments and live them for eternity. I honestly can't think of the best way to end this memoir (because it's not the end?, or perhaps I don't want anything related to our friendship to end), so I'll trust you to figure out how I would want it to end.

Our frequent pilgrimages to Mocha (and even the virtual one) were special, and they helped me know you as a friend along with a debater. The poster boy of Debsoc, dog lover like no other, a masterful debater, someone quick to smile and a friend in need. Keep in touch, I'm looking forward to future discussions.

Unfortunately we didn't hang out a lot after that (despite the 'fake treats') but yeah, Goa and RM were a lot of fun. Btw you really need to work on your Google maps navigation skills XD. The craziness in Goa was crazier, and the bitching in RM was extra spicy because of you!

21,"Yo! First of all, thank you for helping me out in MTH, the surge in my mth grades is highly correlated with you helping me out with the tough ones (ji haan, hum jaise nadan balako ke liye tough the wo..abhi tak geometry nahi pata kya hai mujhe XD). Spending time in RM and astro club with you and Gulati had a lasting, serene quality to it because it just felt inexplicably right. No social pressures, annoying obligations, or a need to constantly filter what I'm saying..I was in my natural habitat when you both were around. Maybe that's why we had so much fun in simple things like cycling around the campus, screening movies in astro club, lounging in RM, sharing meals in Chick Blast (or in Sandy's room lol) or the not so simple (and extremely fun) 'trip' to IIT Bombay for inter IIT XD. BTW I didn't know you were a snack monster! RM third floor Bakarwadi, chowpati snacks on the beaches of Bombay, endless deliveries from zomato itna jata kaha hai? Maybe that super brain of yours requires constant fuel. US-Canada boundary kood ke visit karna, we'll always have a Disneyland ticket for you.

22,"Yo! Pehle to please don't kill me for some of the stuff I might write in this memoir, I don't want to be worried about knives in the night XD. I'm so glad that I finally got to share some treasured moments with you, and you aren't just Anany ki bandi, or Medha ki pagal dost, or the idiot who's rolling on the floor when drunk (I saw that happen, you cannot deny it!) anymore. 

I feel like people who do well in IITK need to be mentally tough, but I've met none as strong and resilient as you. It feels like you've been fighting and rebelling most of your life, and circumstances and people haven't exactly been kind to you (what an understatement!). But the blazing and brave Gunjan I see coming at the end of it is someone I deeply respect, someone with an inhuman strength of character, and someone who did not let the circumstances dictate her journey. I don't care what people say about you (and neither should you), their careless comments do not come close to the truth. I feel like I've had the privilege to experience the real you, and although it required some chipping, the gem in the oyster was that much special. And it was a privilege indeed! I truly am honoured by your trust in me, for considering me a friend worthy of those walks in the last month at IITK. 

I'm not exactly an emotional person, but I would be lying if I didn't feel my eyes turn wet that afternoon. You are one of the rare few I've poured a fraction of my heart to, that moment then was just too irresistible. It's a miracle really that I opened up so quickly, but I guess that speaks for you as a person. And that 'incident' in Goa! I can't think of many who would have continued to remain friends with me, lest forgive me after that. But your response to it was a hug, and that made me feel a little better that day, for I knew I had found a friend who'll always be in my corner. 

I share some of your concerns too silly, we all do. But we're just not brave enough to voice it, just not comfortable enough in our skin. I don't think you're someone who forgets when to stop talking, rather, you're someone who'll trust a friend blindly and pour your heart out to them, and I sincerely appreciate that (as I'm sure all your friends do). You don't need to filter your thoughts, or be mindful of your jokes or be wary of your actions with us. Because Gunjan, we get it, and we love you because and not despite of it. 

Well, I guess I can't end this memoir without thanking you for making my birthday extra special. You're one hell of a stalker, huh! I'm honestly scared now, I can't even think of offending you, for I like my head better on my shoulder rather than rolling as a football (no, you weren't speaking too loudly in Mama-Mio when you were high that day XD). But I genuinely cherish all the efforts you put in for it, it goes to show how much you care for your friends, and it made the desserts extra sweet on my birthday. I guess I'll end with a promise then, a promise to visit you every time I'm back in India until I change your mind and you settle in the US.

P.S. - I'm still waiting for that treat I was promised because I was the first person to pick your call when you got into Google, agli baar nahi mili to tere maal mei oregano mila dunga!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60ce20cd659165b3aa64643b,Gunjan  Jalori
23,"Yo buddy! Everyone falls in their journey, but the best have the strength to get back up and keep moving. I respect you man, because I see you bear that strength. It's weird because maybe it's an effect of reading Sanderson, but you're radiant with the light of Bridge 4 :). You're great at friendship, you know that? It's because you go way beyond the regular tickboxes of being a friend, and I feel like I can always rely on you. You bring a certain uniqueness (for lack of a better word) to any group, a breath of fresh air essential to complete any group. From being a frivolous bundle of energy lighting up faces to a thinker in deep thought, I've seen you be it all. I sincerely appreciate you confiding in me on our Goa trip, and am honoured to have you reward me with your trust. Even Kaladin started his journey through tough times, but your similarity with him lies more to do with how he fought back to become radiant. All the best for the future!

I know it's a big thing to ask, your journey has been incredibly tough, and you've had to fight through a lot. But I know that you are incredibly strong and will pull through whatever is thrown at you, so why not do it with a smile and prove everyone who doubts you wrong? I'm just talking about the smile though, you still need to work on your awkward leg poses XD. Riding through Goa has been amazing with you. Apologies for the last bumpy ride, but I'll make up for it with that white dress you spotted on the way to Morjim. It was amazing hijacking the aero farewell with you (sadly, it's the only one we could go to), but hey, convocation in Goa was amazing too. Congrats on finishing the Doodh Sagar trek first! Tees Maar Khan ke jungly kisse motivated you a lot apparently. Talking to you has always been fun, even if it's bitching about SNT or random RR. You have an extremely comforting presence, and it's so easy to laugh when you're around. Thank you for lighting up my days whenever I've met you. I hope I'm still on your good people list.

IITK places us close because of our roll numbers, and fortunately, that worked out to be incredibly fun in orientation and beyond!

27,"Hello, our newest brother! You are one of those I enjoy talking to the most. Somehow, teri baate directly dil pe hit karti hai and the connection that forms is incredible. Maybe that's because they are always coming from the right place, or maybe because you are unabashed and pure of heart or maybe because we connect on some different level that we are yet to understand. Even though you haven't been with us from the start, you've undoubtedly become an indispensable part of our group, someone who completes us. One of the most dedicated and hardworking members of our batch, surely one of the best we have to offer. And this is not restricted to your work, where we know you're incredible, but extends to your friendships as well. Remember that day in our third year, jab Ram room mei akela baitha hua tha and we both were trying to get him to tell us the problem, or that party in Abhishek's room jab Srinivas mil nahi raha tha, or that night in antaragni where we left hall 6 together. In moments like these, I realised how lucky I am to have a friend like you—an absolut(e) gin(em). Although we share countless memories of cycling trips, Delhi parties, aero farewells, group chats, baby yoda tales, beer exchanges, politics (of both kinds), crazy final month parties (and hangovers) that I cherish, I can't seem to have enough of them.

You are the first family I had at IITK, and I will always have a soft spot for you because of that. I'm sorry we drifted apart in the middle, I wanted to be there for you when you needed me, but I couldn't. I hope I can make up for that in the future. I miss walking around the campus with you in our first year. The random treats, blue world plans and nightouts were extra special because you were there. We'll start afresh with that black hat you always wanted, I hope we can rekindle our friendship. Always believe in yourself! I promise to always be in your corner if ever you need me.

Thanks for supporting my gadda khodne wala idea in Martin Garrix's concert, I still owe you a treat for that (although that extra charge for the semi spending the night was so not worth it). There's a reason your friends love you a lot, and that's because you are a bundle of pure ecstasy (not the emotion, the drug).

This journey would have been impossible without you, whether it's sharing a room for 4 years or sharing a cabin on bus journies. Mr Reliable always! If there's one person I would blindly trust on campus, it has to be you without second thoughts, and you've proven that time and again. Bhand Kushagra ko sambhalna bohot tough hai, and the number of times you've taken care of me is beyond imaginable. Lol I'd even say I was able to party freely because I knew agar kuch bhi hua to Ram bhaiya to sambhal hi lenge (except that day in Goa, beach pe chhut hi gaya tha tu XD). And the number of times you've offered to help on your own, somehow magically sensing when I needed help but was too ashamed or too beaten down to ask for it, is something I can never thank you enough for. Know that I have always appreciated your help and kindness, and it was only a lack of words that inhibited me from expressing my gratitude. Mishra jaisa matlabi admi tak bolta hai ki Ram sabse pehle aage ayenge madad karne, and Khandu ne Hyderabad ke kisse to sunaye hi hai. But obviously, you go way beyond that. You've been a constant rock in the sometimes spiralling experiences of IITK. Not kidding, just looking at your neatly organized side of the room used to give me a sense of stability XD.

I can't think of anyone more deserving the respect that you command over everyone. Ritesh badhiya aadmi hai, yeh sab hi bolte hai (aadhi bottle vodka andar ho ya bahar). It's a big feat that this respect comes primarily out of love, given all your blinding achievements. I've seen many people who pretend to be good, but none so kind and caring even when there's no spotlight to recognize everything they've done. But people do remember your kindness, and so do I, and maybe that's why they remember you as one of their closest friends. You might not remember it, but we met for the first time on the Bollywood night of our first year antaragni. We didn't know each other's name then, but something drew me towards you as I had the most fun swaying and dancing to the music. We've made loads of memories since, from jumping on bollywood songs to spraying passes on football fields, to sharing intern rejections from companies that do not deserve us, to countless parties in the final month. Even though Mishra and Gunjan are great friends of mine, your selection in Google was the most special, simply because you are one of the best IITK has to offer.
