And bro last month would have been difficult without you, as we were probably the only non-smokers among them.xD I really enjoyed the last one month, and tu mera wingie hi ban gaya tha in that month. We played a countless number of computer games, Tekken, Rocket League, Injustice (which you didn’t like much), basketball match almost everyday and a lot of amazing stuffs. I even went for Taekwondo with you, although 1 din bad sports facilities band ho gayi.xD You are a wonderful person and an amazing artist. Wishing you all the success and happiness in your life.

First year se hi hamne bhot saare games khele h, we even had the same controller.xD And then the summer sports camp was amazing, mess toh seriously bhot sahi tha, pta ni Nimbu Pani k kitne glasses piye honge hamne. From going to BBQ, Shopping,Parties, Movies, hanging out in the campus, I really enjoyed your company and all the memories are still fresh. College ka last year to almost miss hi ho gaya, but the memories of that one month can definitely compensate for the whole year. Yaar kitne maje kiye hamne, we almost never slept in the night during those days. And wo Kachori wala incident, that I can never forget in my life.xD Tere sath basketball bhi bhot khela h and tu pro player to h hi, definitely learnt a lot from you.  You are an amazing and a very genuine person, wish you good health and lots of happiness in life. See you soon.
