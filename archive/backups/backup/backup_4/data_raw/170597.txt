Dard dilo ke kam ho jaate agar tum thoda jaldi mil jaate. Tharwani ko atleast humko milane ka credit to dena hi padega. Ek to tu hagge ke uss side aur tha isliye bhi time lag gya pass aane m. Thodi bhut hi jaan pehchaan thi apni tab wo bhi oneplus aur vibrant ki wajah se. Chalo jo bhi ho we finally met ache se in 2nd year and najan the goat mila mujhe.\\n\\nInitially thoda hi football m enthu share karte the apn but then you started playing fpl and dreams 11 and all, then  you came to papa for advice lol. Tab maza aane lga tujhse baat karke and almost roz football talk shuru hogya apna. Mess m ho chahe Canteen m, Itna nostalgia hota tha baat krke. Uss beech tujhe fifa m bhi interest aagya hume dekh dekhke. Kaafi haath pair chalaye tune seekhne ke liye and you became a true fifa addict \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f (just like how its supposed to be). Phir to kya roz fpl discuss kro, fifa khelo, match dekho, bitching kro and repeat. Tujhe thoda bhut shauk bhi tha football khelne ka ground pe tu hamesha puchta tha mujhse aau kya khelne, mein hamesha haan bolta tha lekin i knew ki obviously tere jitna procrastinate krne wala aadmi nhi aayega \xf0\x9f\x98\x82. \\n\\nDheere dheere phir zomato ki lat bhi lg gyi apn ko (credit to goel and you). Itne tatti pizza khae sirf mess se bachane k liye (understandable tho lol). Canteen m bhi veg hi khata tha tu atleast to paneer to roz ka hi tha apna. But kab naa jaane football se shuru hue apn log jyada hi close aa gye. Football ki bitching se chalu krte hue life ki bitching krne lg gye. And who is the best bitching partner (ofc you).\\n\\nTu apni chillness aur optimism k karan bhut badnaam tha but later bhai dekha how important these things are. Under 200 AIR bhale hi tere cpi m naa dikhe lol but tere personality m h bro. You see the big picture and its really hard to be calm about it. Hidden genius in normie words.\\n\\nApni trips to yr kya batau kya sexy hui h abhi take and jo plans h apne aur sexy hone ka chance h. Rishikesh was epic. Scooty, Rafting, Train, delhi and all was amazing. Sorry yr tujhe 3-0 Liverpool k liye nhi uthane ko (in the end it doesnt even matters). Goa bhai really tough away fixture tha apne liye. Apne bina to trip hi nhi ho paata ye wala to. Jis tarah se logo ko ek ek karke convince karne m lag gya, Gaand hi lag gyi thi. But finally goa ka trip was sexy and successful. Ojas ko badiya le aaya tu uske bina kaun pilata apne ko lol. Pool side drinking yaad rhegi and swimming pool m jyada fun krna compared to beaches lol. Rooney celebration karte h wapas kabhi. Ab world cup aur krna h and life worth it feel hogi.\\n\\nCampus m aake bhi yr mein football hi nhi khel pya tumhare saath (fuck my toe). Lekin we had our fun in other ways. Ab to tu itna close aagya h ki kya hi bolna tere baare m aur kuch. Ek hi game khelte h, ek hi team ko support krte h, hopefully ek hi city m bhi honge. \\n\\nItna kamata h ab kharcha chalu krde bhai. Dosto pe, trips pe, party pe, jerseys pe. Milte to roz hi h apn whatsapp pe bas yahi chalta rha.\\n\\nBete abhi to saath hi apn.
