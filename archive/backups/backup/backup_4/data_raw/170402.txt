Hum sab E6-D6 kafi close the waise. That\'s where we began. I had never anticipated ki tu SnT mein ayega. And frankly before you became Batti coordi, I didn\'t realise ki itna chapu hai tu. Guitar, Gym, Batti, Microsoft and then GenSec bhi. We got more closer after Techmeet 8 and the elections. And fir 9 mein to macha hi diya. There were many things planned, but online mein we got a bit halted. No worries. Ab Consulting mein chapna. And yeah, do stay connected!

Remember those nights that we spent together in Hall 12 sitting in front of PIR sensor. Some funny events that I recall during our presentation at IIT B was the cup of tea spilling on the judge which led to our team getting extra time for the presentation.  The best part was our chat on the messenger group with Suraj, Abhigyan, Ashok. Might go through the chat to relive the experience of Techmeet once again !\\n\\nThe next memorable part was our second trip to Mumbai for presenting the prototype to BARC. We were fortunate to have connected with our alumni Sumit Chowdhury who later met us in Hall 12 canteen during his visit to IIT K.\\n\\nWe were really hoping to get a gold medal for the Roorkee edition by BARC/ Alphonso.\\nUnfortunately, this event was a closed-door event and we missed all the fun that we had in Mumbai. \\n\\nWe have been through ups and downs together in our Eclub journey. Thanks for always supporting me in my crazy visions for club. One last thing that we missed was our project on Crazyflie which had to be discontinued due to covid. Our batch will be remembered as the one which revolutionized the club. Not only did we bring in new initiatives, we also renovated the club and redesigned the club website. \\n\\nYour tenure as Gensec will also go down in history for bringing back the title of Techmeet winners. Hope that all four of us will have a chance of reunion some time in the future. \\n\\n","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":true,"_id":"60a6a5e3819323d199d49152"},{"text":"Last year main tujh jaisa dost milna one of the best chiz thi meri tenure ki.

Humne saath mein kitna zyada kaam kiya hai- TA201 project, pehli tech meet mein Mumbai jaana, TA202 project, itne saare batti, non-batti courses aur assignments, consulting prep- thanks for being the go-to guy in all of these! Tere elections ke time kaafi maza aaya tha, aur teri alag level personal growth bhi dekhne ko mili us time.

But uske baad toh kaafi cheezen aligned hone lag gaya tha. Eclub wala tenure mazedar tha waise kaafi, khaas karke end m tere and jay k club renovation wale initiative. But sadly khud k liye club renovate karwaya humne and phir online hi graduate ho gaye. Fir aaya techmeet, uss time kaafi saare projects ek saath kar rhe the hum log. Kudos tujhe and Jay ko, saath m poori contingent ki management wale kaam bhi jo sambhal rahe the tumlog. Somewhere during this, pata chala ki tu gensec ka election ladega. I was like, \\"acha hai\\". But mera pehle se hi decided tha ki, election m bilkul nhi ghusna. And eventually pata nhi kaise, hall 4, hall 10, etc k bahar campaigning kar raha tha. Lastly, tere gensec tenure m, techmeet 9.0 ki jeet was most memorable on the whole journey. All the best for your future endeavours.","author":"Soumya Ranjan Dash","visibility":false,"_id":"60c1da3d659165b3aa6455c9"},{"text":"Broosdk If I go back in time now and agar tu bole tu batti club ke coordi ka form nahi bhar raha to mostly mein backout kar lun. It was one of the best things I did in campus of course and usko average se memorable banane mein I think tera sabse bada contri hoga. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember koi chote chote incidents but this all is because we bonded right from day1. Baakiyon se dheere dheere bonding hui thi. I believe we were always on the same page which is very rare jab etne saare decisions lene ho. Apan mein 0 ladai hui hogi which is quite an achivement. Infact Abhigyan and tere saath bina koi topic ke bhulla kaatne mein bhi kitna maja aata tha. Election time tere liye to kaafi jyada stressful huva hoga but mere liye kaafi memorable tha. After winning Techmeet, my best moment on campus would be jab tu finally jeeta. And ofc ******* etna gussa aaya tha jab last day backout ki baat kar raha tha. Vo to stress mein dikh raha tha esliye kaafi bola nahi. So, overall I would say 3rd year shayad best year of campus life hoga and uska tu lkaafi bada part raha. Mil jaane be kabhi. Ab bhi mokka mile to Gurgaon ko prefer karna Mumbai jaakar kya karega. Vaise ab lag raha chote chote incidents bhi likh dene chayie the 10 saal baad mile to kuch yaad karne ke liye to hona chayie na xD.","author":"Jay  Mundra","visibility":false,"_id":"60c24008659165b3aa645c8f"},{"text":"Gensexx bhai!
