It was cute. I regret not being active in the club when you were Coordi, but glad ki we got to laugh about the club memories last month me. Aashayein harmonies, crushing on XYZ(you know who), treasure hunt, UC wali treat Dosa ke sath (both of us were trying so hard to cut the social awkwardness) and ofc Swinggg.

Forget fluids, I remember the classes better for the gossip you brought along (The OAT beam-walker) and the music we suggested to each other (Post-Modern Jukebox is amazing!). Also, does the M-Club have a spot for alumni performances? \\nThat aside, I admire your authenticity and how straightforward you are. Thanks for being straightforward with your advice when I would worry unnecessarily. \\nI hope you have a great career in Physics! (There\'s a reason why Shyamal and I called you God).

Thanks for being such an amazing roommate. One thing I\'ll always be proud of is that our room was one of the cleanest rooms in our batch xD. I\'m gonna miss so many things - aunty ke chocolate filled cakes (which I stole everytime :p), your M club posters and my wall painting, all those gossips about random people and random bitching, eagerly waiting for each episode of GOT, our alarms ringing alternatively and we procrastinating getting up for hours and so much more. Thanks for always listening to me - I could literally tell you everything knowing that you will keep it a secret. Thanks for making me try that blueberry yoghurt and for filling the CS form for me and priya :p. One time you wore a one-piece and straightened your hair...that day will always be remembered xD.  \\nI still remember how you somehow end up getting injured all the time in first year... ped se takra jana, cycle se gir jana, washroom me phone gira dena lol. You are a bunch of talent. I still don\'t know how many more hidden talents you have .... music painting studies and so much more, chalo at least we can leave dancing :p Wish you all the luck for the new journey you\'re gonna start.
