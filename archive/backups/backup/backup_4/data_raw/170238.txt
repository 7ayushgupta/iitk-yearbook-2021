We met for the first time while adjing a debate in the first sem and comparing notes for the debate. I remember thinking how tf is this guy so organized with his thoughts, aren\'t we both adjudicating for the first time! But that was you, all calm and collected and that\'s how I\'ll remember you. Discussing anything and everything with you has been an awesome experience. Through these discussions, I\'ve learned a lot from you, learnings going beyond simple arguments to a way of organizing my thoughts. From a novice whip to a master, it\'s been a pleasure sharing the debating stage with you, NUJS and beyond was a lot of fun. Thanks for starring in our win over Arnav and for coming to the debate at Hindu. Our frequent pilgrimages to Mocha (and even the virtual one) were special, and they helped me know you as a friend along with a debater. The poster boy of Debsoc, dog lover like no other, a masterful debater, someone quick to smile and a friend in need. Keep in touch, I\'m looking forward to future discussions.\\n\\nP.S. - Thanks for introducing me to Sapiens and Sanderson, they\'ve become some of my favourite reads.","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60c11dbd659165b3aa64536a"},{"text":"Hey man!

Maybe it was a product of the times, but despite the fact that we\'ve spent so little time together, we\'ve already done some of the \\"big\\" things in friendship, like drinking together, nightouts, some crazy parkour over walls, and running from the sis guards. Damn, just talking about this makes me nostalgic. Hope to see more of you in the next year :).

I really miss these things. Specially second-year summer- World cup, financial eco, internship prep.. everything was fun-filled. You are a great person... I don\'t know if there is anything you need to improve in yourself. You are already a great person. I hope we will meet (at the campus) again.
