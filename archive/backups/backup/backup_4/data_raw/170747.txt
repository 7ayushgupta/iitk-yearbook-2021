Tere saath chai peeke sab dukh-dard bhool jata tha mein. I remember our trips to Banarasi tea stall. You made me fall in love with tea. Up until then, I did not know chai could be so intimate. The trip we took to Mussoorie was awesome(Supreme included obviously). I tried alcohol for the first time with you. Thanks. You forced me out of my comfort zone and I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful for that.
