I\'m so tired of being disrespected on this goddamn website. All I wanted to do was post my opinion. MY OPINION. But no, you little bastards think it\'s \\"hilarious\\" to mock those with good opinions. My opinion. while not absolute, is definitely worth the respect to formulate an ACTUAL FUCKING RESPONSE AND NOT JUST A SHORT MEME OF A REPLY. I\'ve been on this site for 6 months: 6 MONTHS and I have never felt this wronged. It boils me up that I could spend so much time thinking and putting effort into things while you shits sit around (probably jerking off to cats or whatever gay shit you like) and make fun of the intellectuals of this world. I\'ve bored you? Good for fucking you. Literally no one cares that your little brain is to underdeveloped and rotted to comprehend my idea...MY GREAT GREAT IDEA. I could sit here all day whining, but I won\'t. I\'m NOT a whiner. I\'m a realist and an intellectual. I know when to call it quits and to leave the babybrains to themselves. I\'m done with this goddamn site and you goddamn immature children. I have lived my life up until this point having to deal with memesters and idiots like you. I know how you work. I know that you all think you\'re \\"epik trolls\\" but you\'re not. You think you baited me? NAH. I\'ve never taken any bait. This is my 100% real opinion divorced from anger. I\'m calm, I\'m serene. I LAUGH when people imply I\'m intellectually low enough to take bait. I always choose to reply just to spite you. I won. I\'ve always won. Losing is not in my skillset. So you\'re probably gonna reply \\"lol epik trolled\\" or \\"u mad bro\\" but once you\'ve done that you\'ve shown me I\'ve won. I\'ve tricked the trickster and conquered memery. I live everyday growing stronger to fight you plebs and low level trolls who are probably 11 (baby, you gotta be 13 to use Leftbook). But whatever, I digress. It\'s just fucking annoying that I\'m never taken serious on this site, goddamn.","author":"Harish  Dechiraju","visibility":true,"_id":"60810b41819323d199d46d52"},{"text":"table ke neeche dekh","author":"Tushar  Goswamy","visibility":false,"_id":"608a6a96819323d199d46f93"},{"text":"table ke neeche dekh","author":"Tushar  Goswamy","visibility":true,"_id":"608c69d6819323d199d475a6"},{"text":"Neeeeelu D - D for debt\\nMujhe campus mai sabse zyada pareshan tune hi kiya hoga.
