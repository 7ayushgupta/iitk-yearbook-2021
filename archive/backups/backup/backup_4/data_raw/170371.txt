The corporate income tax rate is 15%-25% [1]. The CCP levies taxes on businesses which it uses to boost the power and influence the party possesses both in China and abroad. There was once the belief that China would become more democratic as it traded with the world. This prediction has never occurred. In fact, the CCP is stronger than ever before.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party runs hundreds of concentration camps across the country, and your purchase of Chinese made products allow these abuses to continue. At the time of this writing, China has at least 1 million Muslim Uighurs in Chinese run concentration camps [2] where murder, rape, and torture are common occurrences [3]. There are also reports that describe how Chinese authorities are forcing minority women to undergo sterilization [4]. And these abuses detailed above are not just happening to Muslims. Christians, Buddhists, and the Kazakh are also imprisoned in these concentration camps [5] [6]. Women in the camps who do not sing patriotic communist songs or praise president Xi Jinping are raped and electrocuted repeatedly [7].\\n\\nChina suppresses freedom of expression. Communist authorities routinely detain, persecute, and jail people for crimes such as \xe2\x80\x9cspreading rumors\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinsulting the countries leaders\xe2\x80\x9d, according to Human Rights Watch [8] and Amnesty International [9].\\n\\nChina allowed the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cCOVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d virus to proliferate in its own borders before it became a pandemic. When Dr. Li Wenliang, the \xe2\x80\x9cWuhan Whistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d, alerted his community that a strange new virus was killing people, Chinese Communist authorities jailed him where he subsequently died from COVID-19 in jail [10]. The CCP then censored all information about the virus. Eventually, it jumped the border and became a worldwide pandemic.","author":"Harish  Dechiraju","visibility":false,"_id":"60802dbf819323d199d46d2e"},{"text":"Cantt > Sonatalab\\nOffice > Friends\\n:)","author":"Pulkit  Pandey","visibility":true,"_id":"60808c4c819323d199d46d40"},{"text":"First day of college: frustratingly looking for directions of the T.A lab. \\nA week later, runs an election campaign, writes a memo stating direction boards should be kept all all over the academic area.
