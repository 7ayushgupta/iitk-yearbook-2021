You have been one of those few people in CHE jinse kabhi CHE discuss hi nhi hui. I remember many instances when we poked fun at the \\"Kitne Bane, Kitne bane\\" junta. You are a great person to talk to. We have had countless silly discussions, from how Gillian should spend the One Thousand Dollars to Five Ways to Kill a Man.

I think hamne similar struggles face kiye hai so we can easily relate to each other, and share them without any hesitation, yaad hai vo oat me ham dono jo baate ki thi that was so comforting, hame aur yese sessions krne chahiye thi yrr but mauka hi nhi mila yrr.

All those chemical classes together were just fun, we used to play and talk in 2nd-3rd row and hamare profs bhi acche the ki hame kuch bolte nhi the \xf0\x9f\x98\x9d .
