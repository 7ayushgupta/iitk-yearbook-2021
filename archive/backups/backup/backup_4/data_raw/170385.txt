Mess table conversations were always so fun with you. Your extremely misogynistic views about everything were fun to hear.  Your ability to pull out last year\'s question papers is second to None. Love your passion for books and seeing you read tons of history books has also got me interested in it.. I am pretty sure you will be writing a book in a short time which might get you a man booker or get you jailed. Waiting for that.. cant even write all the hilarious conversations we had... just too many. Stay like this and keep loving Manendra Agarwal.

Bro hum ko samajh me nai ata ki tum itna calm and consentreted kese rahta h hamesa. Doing all the assignments before everyone. You manage your time too well. Looking at you I almost got depressed in 1st year (tabhi to room shift kiya tha Shashi or Najan ke sath). But you are really awesome guy. Be it papaji of mini militia, getting intern on day 1, you nailed it everywhere. \\nHope you do great things in the future too.

Boht mast aadmi ho Uncle aap. Pure IITK life me, anytime at the Mess table, I would look ki kahin Uncle baithe toh nahi hai. Agar aap mil gaye toh bas, kaam khatam! 1-1.5 ghante ka mahol set.

You can be a very good teacher.\\nI remember you hated hss courses in the first year, aur ab aapne jitna diverse topics padha h utna kam hi logo ne padha hoga.\\nUncle you have this extraordinary trait of giving everything to a task until you succeed.

And aptly so! Probably one of the most unique guys I have come to know on campus, w.r.t your traits, behaviours, nuances and of course (borderline misogynistic?) views :P.
