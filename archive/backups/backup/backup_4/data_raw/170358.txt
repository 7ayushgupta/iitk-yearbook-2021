Jab tu shuru mein aaya tha tab mujhe teri shakal mere ek Kota wale friend ke jaisi lagti thi XD. First year mein to kaafi faila ke rakhta tha tu samaan. Teri cupboard ka saara saamaan table aur chairs pe aa jaata tha sem end hote hote. Fir vahi, exam jab khatam hote the tab jamata tha wapas. Lekin abhi end tak aate aate kaafi zyada improvise kar liya hai tune, even mujhe beat kar diya safai ke maamle mein. Tera vo superman wala pose yaad hai jo tujhe Nupur ne karne ko kaha tha?

Antaragni mein Coke Studio aur Local Train ke shows mein kya mast maje kiye the. Aur tera aur Mishra ka vo controller ke liye fight club karna. Ek baar to tumlog paper fight khel rahe the, jo towel fight mein convert ho gayi thi baad mein. Jab bhi kahi bahar se room pe aata tha to kuchh na kuchh bakchodi karta hua hi milta tha tu. Jhadu se jo tune Abhishek ko maara bhand hoke, aaha, saare sur aur taal mil gaye. Aur fir shoes pehen ke hi so gya bed pe. Cooridor ki aur teri haalat dekhte hi samajh gya tha ki kuchh hua hai. Aur uss din bete ka birthday yaad hai, jab apan thoda baith ke apne room wapas jaane wale the. Lekin tu dance karne lag gya tha aur mai room chala gya. Thodi der baad mai dekhta hu ki do log tujhe room pe laate hai, aur tujhse khada nahi hua jaa raha. Aise na jaane kitne karname kiye hai tune. Goa mein bhi kya sahi maze kiye the yaar.
