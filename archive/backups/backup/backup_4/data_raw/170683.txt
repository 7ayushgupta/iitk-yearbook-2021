The first memory would be when the batches had just shuffled in 11th. The first day we had a maths class test (3-4pm) before our classes began. You could feel the nervousness among the people that had just changed their batch. Then there\'s this guy. Curly hair, just woken up, about 20 mins late in a 50 mins test and then casually walking up to his seat. I think you took a good 5 mins before you realized there was a test going on. Cut to the results, the next day and what do you see?
