Jab bhi kuch kehna hota hai tumse mai toh seedha keh deta hu tumhe dont think aisa kuch hoga jo nahi keh paaya hounga. Thanks for giving me that space and trusting me at the same time. I remember that one time when you sensed that I might be overthinking things and might be in the guilt that I have messed up things. You knew I might be hurting myself just by overthinking on that and you sent me the most comforting text one could possibly send at that time. tbh I was really really scared at that time and you helped me. Life is weird no? Sometimes we help people and we think that it is a very small thing for us but it really means a lot to them. Thanks for that. Well this was just one incident, I think there a lot more incidents where you helped me when I wasn\'t doing okay, Even lockdown ke time me you were one of the very few people jinse meri har roz baat hoti thi and I think uska reason bhi obvious hai. You end up where you find most comfortable.  Thanks for existing. Thanks for everything. I will never forget the antaragni nights when we scrolled tinder together, the nights in sixth semester when we bonded and opened up to each other, that one whole night when we shared the gossips, the days when we planned out things together, the last night when you gave me that letter and other countless occasions.

It was one of the sweetest and most wholesome things anyone has ever done for me. The message you wrote inside was very heart-warming. You almost had me in tears that evening. It meant a lot. Thank you again <3<3\\n\\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to know you much initially but roaming around in Antaragni with you was veryyy fun. All that mocking and daring we five used to do around, I will always remember it. That was the time when we started bonding. \\n\\nWorking beside you as a CS Coordinator was pure bliss for me. This tenure definitely made us better friends and improved our bond. It was my pleasure (and honour as well :P) working with you as your fellow Coordie. I wish we could have gotten more time to work with each other on the campus itself.\\n\\nYou are one of the most sincere, kind, and wholesome people I know. Always stay the same, a lot of people (including me :) ) cherish you for that <3. We will soon meet again. I will be in Bengaluru, and I might drop off to Mangalore and ask you for a tour, so please be prepared for that :P. Also, our Coordie trip is pending, so let\xe2\x80\x99s plan it as soon as the situation returns to normalcy.\\n\\nAll the very best for your journey!! Take care and lots of love <3<3<3","author":"Tanishq  Patil","visibility":true,"_id":"60c10dda659165b3aa64531b"},{"text":"Hey Yashika !!\\nI still remember how in the first year we used to fight and argue even over the silliest things but don\'t know when and how we became such best friends. \\nAnd yeah, we haven\'t talked for days and even months but still, our friendship grew stronger and stronger.

My first impression of you was that you were really friendly and socially smart. Someone I looked up to as I was really shy and introverted and most of the time didn\'t know how to interact with people. Chapu toh hai hi tu from dance to classes. Thanks for the lessons and doubt clearing in CHM/CHE courses. We also had taken CHM102 doubt clearing session... I was too nervous, but you handled it like a pro!
