You are a nice and helpful person, and also one of the most studious, hardworking and work oriented person, in short chaapu :p person.

I have been in the hostel from my 9th standard, and you are the best roommate I have ever made. I am so sorry for the alarm sound ( scooby doo pa pa.. even I hate it now). My first impression of you was she would be super smart, cute and very cheerful, which you really are. I wish we could get one more EDM night to go dance like crazy. Thanks for being there when I was feeling emotionally low in my second year :). I loved when aunty brought those different eatables which she prepared in our room. Please send me the recipe, that flavour is still in memory. Other than studious Esha, which most of the others know, I am glad I got to know Esha, who loves dancing during EDMs and treats, does Zumba, chit-chats, gossips, and is very fun-loving. Of course, never start a year watching Vivah; we know it\'s going to be a disaster. \\n\\n  We will be in touch, love you a lot and all the very best <3","author":"Yashika","visibility":true,"_id":"60a41544819323d199d48076"},{"text":"\\"Tum gandeee ho!!!!\\"","author":"Rijul  Tandon","visibility":true,"_id":"60a4157d819323d199d48077"},{"text":"Yo pseudo behen!!\\nProbably one of the cutest and sweetest girl on the campus.

First of all, thank you for helping me out in MTH, the surge in my mth grades is highly correlated with you helping me out with the tough ones (ji haan, hum jaise nadan balako ke liye tough the wo..abhi tak geometry nahi pata kya hai mujhe XD). Spending time in RM and astro club with you and Gulati had a lasting, serene quality to it because it just felt inexplicably right. No social pressures, annoying obligations, or a need to constantly filter what I\'m saying..I was in my natural habitat when you both were around. Maybe that\'s why we had so much fun in simple things like cycling around the campus, screening movies in astro club, lounging in RM, sharing meals in Chick Blast (or in Sandy\'s room lol) or the not so simple (and extremely fun) \'trip\' to IIT Bombay for inter IIT XD. BTW I didn\'t know you were a snack monster! RM third floor Bakarwadi, chowpati snacks on the beaches of Bombay, endless deliveries from zomato itna jata kaha hai? Maybe that super brain of yours requires constant fuel. US-Canada boundary kood ke visit karna, we\'ll always have a Disneyland ticket for you.\\n\\nP.S. - We\'ve watched one of the most entertaining football matches together, dogs pasand nahi koi baat nahi but ab football follow karna padega.","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":false,"_id":"60c2256c659165b3aa6459ac"},{"text":"Hello MTH god.
