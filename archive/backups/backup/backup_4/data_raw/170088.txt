But on the bright side, because of your questioning, the tutor was lenient to us during the vivas \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3, so ya thanks for that too.

Funnily enough, we were both on campus for a good two and half years and yet we first interacted at the HCIL HQ in Delhi. The Honda YES experience was definitely a memorable one. The ceremony was even better. And what a speech that was at the ceremony! and ofc, that completely defined your caliber! It\'s been great getting to know you and I have honestly learned a lot from you. Thank you for the good discussions while applying for YES plus earlier this year. I believe we\'ll be bearing the responsibility of doing the publicity for the YES program for some more time xD. So, definitely gonna be in touch.
