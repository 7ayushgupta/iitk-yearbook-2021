I guess you were more happy than me when I got an opportunity to work under him. During the second year summer, I learnt various things about the project from you regarding the project, got the help from you again and again for a small problem in the project. You taught me how to use VASP and HPC and all the stuffs. It was great to spent time with you during the project. During the third year we started talking a little more due to almost same courses. After that we started taking the same  OE courses before discussion and the things went on. Then the random calls and discussion about the internship, life and all the silly stuffs. Ransom talks\\nabout the professors and all.  I guess you don\'t have cheated much during the exams before college life but you started that in the PHY473A also. Doing the crypto  in the same group was a lot fun. We spent whole day in cracking the DES but at last we figured out that our code is wrong. Also PHY690W was also a fun with you. You shown extraordinary performance by writing the codes in the last moment. It was one of my best group to work with you in PHY690W, raat me PPT banana\\nand report late me submit krna, all the things were fun. Assignments bhi bahut tumse copy kiya aur pakde nahi gaye.
