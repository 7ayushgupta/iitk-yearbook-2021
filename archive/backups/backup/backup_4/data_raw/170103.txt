From literally seeking your blessings before exams in the first sem to the final hug before leaving IITK, you\'ve been an integral part of my stay at IITK. You are the person I respect the most in IITK, and it never fails to amaze me how you always know the right thing to do, whatever the situation might be. I honestly wouldn\'t have believed that a perfect blend of understanding, smartness, kindness, courage, fun, wit, creativity, charm, humour, insight, personability, confidence, empathy, adventure (running out of adjectives here) could have existed, but you proved me wrong. From our first interaction on the mess table in the first sem to goodbyes of the last month, I knew I was talking to someone special. You\'ve always been the strength of the group (including fight club XD) while also being the most comforting presence with an easy and charming laugh.  We have often shared moments of understanding, where a slight of the eye or a mid-sentence pause or a passing reference communicated what words could not, and the fact you could do this with anyone is a one in billion quality (and so are you!). I\'ll admit it, I was a little envious of you initially, but that quickly changed into awe, love and respect. You\'ve been a constant inspiration for me, and I owe a lot of my transformation at IITK to learning from you. After all, who better to model yourself from than a guy who\'s seemingly perfect at everything. Your friendship means a lot to me, and one of the few times I\'ve felt the freedom to be my genuine self have been while talking to you. Thank you for listening to me and accepting me during those times, I hope I can someday explain how important those moments have been. Bhoolne ka to sawal hi nahi uthta, I\'m never finding anyone like you anywhere I may travel. All the best for your future mate, know that someone will always be in your corner whatever the situation (I\'ve learnt this from the best ;) ).","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60bfdfe6659165b3aa645149"},{"text":"Sir AIR10,\\nAnany tu ekdum ideal raha hai college me.
