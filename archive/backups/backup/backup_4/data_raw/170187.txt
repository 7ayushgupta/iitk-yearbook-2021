You could sometimes (SOMETIMES) read my expressions and would warn me to use a filter. The list goes on and on. I most liked that you are a great secret keeper and try not to show your judgments (judge sab karte hai obviously). You always had a good movie, bean bag and snacks in your room (or I added in your canteen account :p). You always made my birthdays super special(when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget) and thanks for the cookies, next time it is your duty to bring double the amount of the same cookies.
