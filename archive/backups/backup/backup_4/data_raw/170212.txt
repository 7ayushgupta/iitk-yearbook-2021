It\'s a shame that we did not talk then, to the extent that until the time we found each other getting drenched in the rain during orientation, I didn\'t even know you were coming to IITK! Never did I know that that guy would turn out to be the best (and very insane) brother I could have ever asked for. The campus wouldn\'t have been half as fun as it was without you. \\n\\nBefore making you all weepy by recalling our best memories, I need to say this - you have such a unique influence on your friends that makes them jump up from their inertia-seats and do some Bhavy-fun. I appreciate how you lift my spirit even in the worst times and make every problem look insignificant. I know we have had our fair share of RR, but some unsaid understanding of \'this shall pass\' between us makes us joke about them while being knee-deep in life\'s shit. It is insane how at one moment you are this idiotic chotu who makes me facepalm at a frequency of 50 Hertz, and at the next moment, you are talking sense into me like a zindagi-ke-dard--know-it-all.

Peace.\\n\\nWhile you are supposed to reminisce your memories with someone here, I can\'t think of them in a finite number. But here are some campus ones that are absolutely close to my heart - sending fifty-odd gaalis to each other every day for absolutely no reason, helping you out when you were getting your ass kicked in PSO and pulling those all-nighters, bouncing into you in RM every day, our trips (with much-loved third-wheeling :-), and of course Hall-5 badminton. Remember how you highjacked that king-sized bed I wanted in Kochi? For the sake of other readers\' sanity, I am going to skip the part where I talk about the methodology employed, but man, you skipped death that day. \\n\\nSurviving lockdown would have been impossible without you. I would always look forward to us randomly crashing each others\' place. From the first (and a very awkward :-) visit to my place to multiple weekly visits during the lockdown, and finally, to me crashing at your place for some 15 odd fucking days, it is incredible how you are the first person who comes to mind whenever I am sad and need some cheering up. You made the college end not suck and even fun with all the karaoke, Bipasha, patte-sutta, jooooms, and my cutting-edge cooking. It was fun man.
