Mst hi honge as always with contagious smile and lightness in your eyes. You are a wonderful friend. I am extremely lucky that I met you. \\nAesa nhi tha ki hum 1st semester m bahut achche friends the, hum wingie the. Phir bhi tumhara mujhe campus bulaane m help krna is applaudable.

These words are like tip of iceberg. I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain everything in words. But after listening to these words, a sudden outburst of confidence hit me. Despite failing to be in campus for 2 times, I came back for 3rd time and never left solely because of your support at that time and your belief in me. \xe2\x80\x9cDoobe ko teenke ka sahar\xe2\x80\x9d, what does this actually mean I get to know through you. You were like ray of light in darkness at that time. \\nI admire your simplicity and helpful nature. But the story does not end here, the story started from here.

And I can\xe2\x80\x99t be thankful enough for everything. The person that I am today would not exist without your never-ending support. You are the person who inspired me very much. That inspiration led me to apply for SG because I wanted to be the person like you who helps others.\\nYou are sincere in your feelings. You are most religious and spiritual guy I ever met. I never saw you refusing to help or making excuses to avoid helping others. Har kisi ko padhne ko motivate krte rehte ho hmesha. Chaapu to h hi aap. Your hardwork speaks for itself.
