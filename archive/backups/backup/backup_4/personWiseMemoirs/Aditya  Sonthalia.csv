3,"Mishra ji, Bokaro king. Aapke baat karne ki tehzeeb kisime nahi dekhi campus me. My favourite memory will always be you taking me in front of the hall 9 bathroom mirror and telling me “Ye dekhiye 4 Aditya” and then explaining BFS DFS and cryptography to me in the corridor lmao. You are one of the very few people who calls me Aditya in campus lol. Aapse unique sahi me kisiko nahi dekha, legit din me agarbatti jalate hain raat ko kuch aur. Bangalore me bhi bohot bhandi raatein hongi bro. Love our pictures from Antaragni and SG times. Maze kariye, jald milte hain :)

4,"Hello discord bot. Did you know that the first person convicted of speeding was going 8 miles per hour. Anyway, you have introduced me to the golden combination of chai sutta and I will always be grateful for that. You are one of the truest friends one can have and you have proven that so many times. Making sandwiches and cocktails for everyone- be it at 3 AM in the night or early morning, you are always there. Tere gifts to everyone and cool documentary recommendations- all are super cool. Tera cooler is actually insane bro, and don’t give up on art, that is one thing which makes you so unique and fun. Trek pe itna enthu kaise tha bhai tumme ab tak nahi samajh aaya xD Milte hain jald jaise hi gharwaale nikalne de mujhe, baaki aao raat clubhouse pe velle baithe hi hain sab :)

5,"I still remember how we once talked about sex with the therapist as a porn category and then I had a link ready for it. There have been multiple “maal hai kya, paper hai kya, bong hai kya” conversations pre-lockdown and ig that’s what ganja gang has been about. Atreyee texting me though will remain the funniest memory of you lol. Awkwardness aside, you’re pretty chill, funny and hardworking and I admire that. All the best for the future :)

6,"“Bro lock karke mat jaana nahane jaa raha hu”
“Bro thoda canteen wagareh ghoom ke aa 12 baje tak xD”
“Bro fuck TA, kaun padhega”
And a ton more memories. I’m lucky to have vibed with you and to have found you as a roommate. Our collective room beautification but at the same time the contrast between the two halves of the room will remain my favourite memory. I really got psyched by the way you even kept your socks properly dude. You have already highlighted a lot of key fun stuff in my memoir lol. One which you missed is the awe with which we were looking at each other when Kothari ate all that food in the canteen. End ke mahine me bhi tumhe bhand kar hi diya and of course your super organised room was ready as a sleep backup everytime too. OH ALSO WE SIGN OFF AS WANTED IN THE KD BUILDING WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I’m sure chill karte karte you will kill it in your field. All the best, milte hain jald :)

I’ll always cherish the random 4 AM yappy cafe visit we had after your oyo interview. Hopefully, dieting, plans to run away abroad and getting married to a Muslim is on decently xD Baaki detail me tumhare vogue gift me likh diya tha sab kuch, padhlo wapas. P.S.
