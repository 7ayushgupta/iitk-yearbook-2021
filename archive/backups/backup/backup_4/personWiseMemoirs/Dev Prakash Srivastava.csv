0,"Sharma bro! Bhai tumhare jaisa seedha aur genuine insaan nahi dekha maine. Never talked alot in the first year. But ESO208 se jo baat hona start hui. Honestly the most hilarious course, exam ke baad burai karne mein maza aa jata tha. Also seeing you move from starting the assignment a week back to starting the night of deadline (courtesy me obviously 😌). And there was no going back after that. All those long walks to doaa in the middle of the night when everything was closed, exam time mein CCD aur CC mein pade rehna caffeinated af. I think we made a record when 9 people slept in your single room (perfect wedding feels).
Man it was great to know you. Aadha ECO mein toh mai teri wajah se aa gaya.

P.S. First year mein mil jaata toh ECO mein hi BC kar leta😂",Dev Prakash Srivastava,True,60c22cad659165b3aa645a54,Aditya  Sharma
1,"Hey bro! Bhai tumhara likhna start karun toh iss memoir mein fit nahi hoga. The most fun loving person I've met on campus. Campus mein sabse zyada bakchodi kari toh tere saath - antaragni parties, drunk pictionary 😂, lambi walk pe jaana, raat mein campus ki obscure jagah explore karna, acad area mein aadhii wing ke saath chhupna, summers mein raat mein padhai kam bakchodi zyada, chhat par baith ke horror movies binge karna, tujhe aur ojha ko road par se uthana😂 -kya kuchh nahi kiya tere saath.
But saath hi mein teri planning skills kya sahi hai - weekly schedules, to do lists, trip planning😝. Also thanks for spending sooo much time and efforts for planning and executing my gifts. Tere bina mera kya hi hota.
Finally, you are a really good person. Stay like this always!",Dev Prakash Srivastava,True,60c24104659165b3aa645cc2,Chirag  Kapoor
2,"Yo man! I must say it has been a mad journey at IITK. You went from that really serious guy with that backpack religiously going to the audi to you coming to my room screaming at Ritesh (the contents best conveyed through DM🤣)  - that too all within one year.

I think I really got to know you in the second year, newly BC-ed to CHE, plus did the same courses (even HSS!). All those assignments and course-shit, and along with it lots and lots of talking. And finally, you bore witness to my epic 2nd year CHE fraud culminating with the Fluids debacle, I almost convinced you that drugs are good. I am somehow proud of the bad influence I was to you - you desperately needed it😝 (Blatant self-importance but true). to be fair tho, I gained a lot of stuff from you too. In some senses you were a stark opposite of mine and through you I realised aspects I had never considered and maybe made me change too or at least respect them.

All in all I feel like I have seen different you-s throughout the 3 years at campus, tho all connected by a thread. But maybe that's what IITK does. You go through the highs and lows, discover new stuff, come to respect things you took for granted and constantly keep learning and changing. And I'm glad to have shared this journey with you.

P.S. - Right on the deadline, like always😎",Dev Prakash Srivastava,True,60c1697a659165b3aa64541b,Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh
3,"I remember my first all-nighter in IITK. First year, sitting in your room (E-101), playing CONTACT😂 and then getting into some deep philosophical shit till morning(as would become typical). From then to my last all-nighter, sitting on the path in front of A-Block, wondering how our time at IITK will be coming to an end and how we’ll make the most of it, it has been hell of a ride. Through all the years at IITK, I’m glad we shared all those talks, some sober and some drunk af. 
Also that birthday surprise you all gave, hard shit to forget😁. It was one of my best moments at IITK.
Finally, I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again you are the person whom I’ve seen evolve the most in IITK and I greatly admire and respect you for it.

P.S -: Kya bakchod posters the tere room pe

P.S -: Writing as if hum jaa rahe hain but abhi ek aur saal mil ke enjoy karna hai

4,"Bhai ab kya hi bolun tere baare mein. The best roommate I could have possibly had. Itna room ka sacrifice mere liye koi nahi karta😂. Last tak.
Lag hi nahi raha itna time beet gaya. First year mein raat mein sabke saath bakchodi karna, raat raat bhar tv shows, subah jaa ke sona.
Baad mein tere room ka scene fixed ho gaya tha. Tu table pe dabba aur register 
pen rakhh ke baitha rehta tha aur kam se kam do log baith ke bakchodi kar rahe hote the. Bechaare battu ko bohot bewakoof banaya.
But enjoy bohot kiya. Tere aur Chirag ke saath winters mein baith ke tandoor ke saamne naan aur chicken khana, cycling karna, badminton khelna. Will miss you man. Manali ki trip toh nahi bani. Bangalore mein milenge ab.",Dev Prakash Srivastava,True,60c23111659165b3aa645ad2,Ritesh  Naik
