Dhoni toh chalo chutiya hi hai :P humlog definitely touch me rahenge, C110 will stay alive, saalon baad IITK wapas jaayenge mai tu Vedant C110 me ek din shivbhakti karenge.

Shadi me bulana bhai teri jaldi ho jayegi shayad? I reckon apne wing me Dishant (Rajasthan) ke baad sabse pehle teri hi hogi :P",Yugesh Ajit Kothari,True,60c22fac659165b3aa645aa1,Kevlin

Alrighty, bhai I think we got to know each other through PClub, but over time became really good friends. Heres to the 100s of lunch(s)/dinners at ChicBlast, to being stressed of the same things as pclub coordis, to hiding pizzas in NCL during blackbox and to hours and hours of endless discussions and rants in KD/RM. Hoping these days are not over and that Stanford or EPFL, we will continue to stay in touch and possibly even do all of those things yet again. I think we are in way too many common social media groups to lose touch but lets keeeep in touch. Also I think we had the coolest club t-shirt of all time during our tenure!",Yugesh Ajit Kothari,True,60c2310d659165b3aa645ad1,Kushagra  Gupta

Mujhe lagta hai maine IITK ki majority life happenings tujhe hi batayi hai sabse pehle. Do you remember December 2019 before I went to MPI, what a night that was man :') Sorry I broke your laptop that day lol. Bhai raat raat rolls aur dominos se pizza mangwana. First year me shorts me thand me 2 bje Crown burgur jaana, humne toh sath me kitna kuch kiya hai yaar! Tu acha aadmi hai thoda zyada hi sabse bohot achi dosti hai teri isiliye silently har friend circle me all powerful ho jaata hai (although ab maine bhatia aur nikunj ne ye realize kar liya hai :P ) Apna poker table acha set ho gaya hai yaar isko chodenge nahi saalon saal chalayenge! Baaki Covid me ghar pe scene sath me banane ka maza hi aur raha hai yaar XD 
Madhur you have truly been an amazing friend and an indisposable part of my IITK journey. Also good that tune end me Dual drop kar hi diya tujhe kitna samjhaya tha ki pointless hai tere liye :P Bhai SnT Secy banna tha yaar tujhe tu khada hota hum bana hi dete bhai kyu nahi hua. Know that you will always be in my thoughts and prayers and I hope you find a girl soon (or are you more interested in Dikshant?) Europe aao bhai ghumne chalte hain amsterdam. Eastern Europe me *** ka precursor mil jata hai easily udher pure milega bhai mazza aayega! Milte hain jald hi! Time series yaad hai na kya bakchod nikala tha humne xD Presentation lol.

41,"In a 1:16 sex ratio in our batch I had very few female friends and you were one of them. Hum dono aise alag se bohot hangout toh nahi kiye hian but common friends, places me kaafi beaten toh kiye hi hain. I am not sure tu final sem me friendly se 420 friendly hui thi ya nahi par hui thi toh maine miss kardiya yaar, you make very nice insta reels and watching you dance high would have been entertaining! Apan randomly college me mil jaate the toh beaten toh kaafi kar hi lete the, teri vibe botot achi hai Medha stay like this always! Hopefully fir asehi kisi common context me milenge and it will be just as easy for us to hangout as it has always been.

COVID life me bhi ab tune chaar chand laga diye hain bhai jaldi se karde kal hi karde bhai please time lagta hai thoda aane me. Hamari wing ka na ho ke bhi tu hamari wing ka tha bhai, Vedant ke double room me reh hi lena chahiye tha tujhe 3rd year me full time. Tu itna pav kaise kha leta hai?????? Kasol me toh tune kya kya dikha diya bhai mai kabhi nahi bhulunga wo Challal aur Katagla aur baaki random gaon. Freedom is truly hard to find but we found it lol :P

Trading kar bhai aur trading kara bhi thodi. Fundae tujhe kabhi bohot dene nahi pade hain tu cheezen kar hi leta hai khudse.

49,"60,000+ Whatsapp messages in 2 odd years (maybe another 200-300 odd hours of calls at least?). By any measure that's quite a lot Pratigya! Despite all ups and downs, you've been an extremely non-trivial part of my IITK journey. Endless gossip, random conversations (sometimes unbelievably so), non-stop bakwas about anything and everything on God's green Earth, and all those walks across campus. I think in retrospect there's a lot to remember, a lot to laugh and cry about, and a lot to reminisce about. I hope you liked Calvin and Hobbes (or at least I hope you read half of it xD ). I could never get you to read many books nor watch some of my favourite shows but if you ever want to (or for that matter talk about random things again), you know where to find me! 
Alright Pratigya, I don't have a lot to write here, I think you know.
Its been real! :)
