4 saal kab khatam ho gaye bhai pata nhi chala, isse lambe to apne faltu ke philosophy ke discussions chalte the. Saath me trip plans bana ke aur actually execute karne me bohot maza aaya, aur shayad bas mai aur tu hi the constant har trip me. Aur banate hain jald hi hopefully. Cheezein to bohot yaad aa rhi hain par first year me diwar kudne wali bakchodi stand out karti hai. Aur uske alawa wo delhi to kanpur local train F***. Mauj hi ho gayi thi. To many more trips, parties and hackathons together cheers (tu giloy pee lena)

BTW you are a n-ice guy🤣🤣😜",Yash  Kuwade,True,609c1666819323d199d47a1f,Aditya  Gupta
1,"Hey Sonty! Waise I got to know you a little late but bettter late than never lol. I still remember hall 1 ke bahar you, me, anmol and pulkit discussing random things after midnight, more to the tune of gossip lmao. But those were really fun times. Hope to chance upon you sometime, keep well😁",Yash  Kuwade,True,60a3efd8819323d199d47fea,Aditya  Sonthalia
2,"Hey Ananya!
Microeco was really terrible but having you people in the same class made it bearable😂 Joking around outside book club coordi interviews was a really fun memory. You have a great attitude and drive, and a lovely smile. All the very best for your future, you got it😁",Yash  Kuwade,False,60c2599d659165b3aa6460f3,Ananya  Goswami
3,"Yooo Jai!! You are one of the coolest people I've met here. I think we properly met only during the coordi interviews, chattering outside in OAT. The tenure was superfun and you were one of the reasons why😁 Also wo weird psycho questionnaire me maine aur bhi zyada weird answers likhe the if you remember😂 Milte hain fir kabhi!",Yash  Kuwade,True,60a4f8e2819323d199d482c7,Jai Ranjan Sharma

6,"Hey Ayush!
Vox ka first article with you, Saksham and Sidsax was a lit experience. Also tere room me vo vox hangout while playing organ attack and bearing with Sanket's jokes 😂You always came across as very friendly and welcoming and I'm happy to have known you. Obviously you'll achieve great things as you have in the past. 
Best of luck for the future and hope to meet sometime!",Yash  Kuwade,True,60b337db659165b3aa644ee8,Ayush  Agarwal
7,"Hey! Almost forgot about that question😂 Mai aur bhaiya ekdum velle ghum rhe the us time, thx for showing up. Tumhari stories to kafi suni hain bhaiya/ramola se, always referred to as ""Madam"" (origin story?😂). 
Best of luck for the future😁 ",Yash  Kuwade,True,60a886bf819323d199d49391,Dishaa  Rajora
8,"Memories to itni hai ki sari yaha aa nhi sakti. Infact aadhi to bhool bhi gaye honge. Starting from orientation wala tug of war to last day wali high and senti feels, I found a brother in you aur aage bhi aise hi chalta rahe bas. Zyada anecdotes to yaad nhi dilaunga par youtuber ram manohar ki brainstorming se leke shooting tak everything was lit(literally) aur college ki core memories me se ek hai for me. Bas chaapta reh forever, jaisa tera enthu aur attitude hai success is inevitable. Naam enthu kumar aise hi nhi rakha gaya tha lol. Aur age wale jokes chalte rahenge. 😁😂",Yash  Kuwade,True,609c131f819323d199d47a1e,Rishabh  Ramola
9,"Veere!! randomly punjabi me tujhse baat karna has been a constant kick in my life😂😂 Tu jitna sorted hai maine aur koi nhi dekha. Also mere jokes appreciate karne wale select few me se ek🤣 Mere room me baithke pulkit ko roast karne wale sessions hamesha yaad rahenge. I'll miss knocking at your door and calling you for the mess. Wo 2nd/3rd(time bhool gaya experience yaad hai😝) year wala dominos ka late pizza was too goooood. Stay cool, stay glassy brown munde. Aur milte hain asap.

PS: galaxy ki performance was not bad really😂",Yash  Kuwade,True,609c19f4819323d199d47a21,Saksham  Gupta
10,"Aur bhaiya! agar tujhe sum up karna ho to bolunga Rancho jaisa inventor, Raju jaisa engineer, and Farhan jaisa artist all in one. Tere jokes aur rants sunate rehna. Main mere sunate rahunga🤣
Thanks for all the profile pics😛",Yash  Kuwade,True,60a3ec95819323d199d47fdf,Shashwat  Shukla
11,"Hey Shreyas(h)! 
Mai to hun ek saal unlike Pulkit par lag nhi rha campus khulega lol. First year, Litsoc room, blitz round -- these words together bring back more memories than the number of prompts we guessed😂 Happy to have shared moments like Diwali wala sasta GTA shoot, S words ki groundbreaking success, and end end me tere chhat wale chutiyape. 
Thanks for your glasses😛",Yash  Kuwade,True,60bba67c659165b3aa644fe7,Shreyash  Ravi
12,"Aur bhaiya Ujjwal! DR1 forever🙏 Humlog pehli baar first year me mile the agar tumhe yaad ho, aur wo bhi galaxy ELS me😂😂 sabse unexpected jagah. Abhi ek saal aur hai, campus khul jaye bas wingies banke bohot mauj karenge🤣 Chapte to tum rahoge hi, bas kripa banaye rakhna😂",Yash  Kuwade,True,60a65461819323d199d48e5b,Ujjwal Pratap Singh
13,"Hey Yatin! never would've met you if not for the KGMU thing. Kitna maza aaya tha bhai udhar, I remember the mnms and all the fun we had playing games and hunting for a good place to eat lol. Also ""OKAA"".  Mere pas abhi bhi tera photo rakha hai sitting on the floor of the corridor for god knows what reason😂 maybe I'll get to post it sometime. Your humor stands out, in a good way😆 Loved knowing you and the BSBE gang. Milte hai kabhi fir!",Yash  Kuwade,True,60a6482b819323d199d48d76,Yatin  Azad
