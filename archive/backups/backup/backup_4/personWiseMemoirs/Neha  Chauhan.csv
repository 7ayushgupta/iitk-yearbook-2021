Dude you are the most humble and warm soul I have got interact within iitk. You are a genuinely socially smart and friendly person. I have never seen you talking shit or rudely to anyone... you always seem to have this amazing cheerful calmness with you that I sometimes wished I had in me. Your dedication and passion towards volleyball and just the positive energy you bring into the team including boys and girls, I really appreciate that about you dude. You remember the PSY class in which you were asking me whether sir called out your name as you were away... and then sir actually called out your name... that was such a coincidence.XD.
Yar sahi m humare do plans rah gaye execute hona. T_T. Cheers to all the memories we made in volleyball court and during team hangouts. Sadly hume farewell party nhi milegi. TT_TT
PS. After seeing your memoirs I get to know you are a great CS go player... dude come play Valorant! I would love to play valorant with you! 
It was always fun talking to you. Hope we get to meet soon on the campus. ",Neha  Chauhan,True,60c249ef659165b3aa645e50,Abhinav  Bende

From going to Japan to meeting at IIT Kanpur, what a coincidence yar! I didn't get to talk much with you in college, but it was always fun whenever we interacted. The wall painting work as a fresher was bearable because of you.. and worked on it till the very end. It was fun painting with you... also, in the PG orientation, speed painting😊😊😊 
Stay safe and amazing.",Neha  Chauhan,False,60c22456659165b3aa645995,Ananya  Goswami
2,"Hey Priyal, I am here to say that you are a nice and warm person. I remember the incident in SOC class when I had to sit on the second row due to some ahem reason, I was too nervous and asked you and Priyakhee (the only girls other than me in the course) to come and join me there, and you came and sat beside me. TT_TT I never thanked you properly for this. Thank you. Probably you get to hear this a lot: You are really a sweet and cool person. (like icecream) :P 
Stay safe and happy.

Plays only compy.. ""the best phoenix in the whole world""! 
Dude, you are awesome and so effortlessly talented... You were great support for many MTH courses in the online sem. It was an enriching experience to get to know you. You are a nice person imo.
All the best for everything in the life ahead dude!",Neha  Chauhan,True,60c24e9a659165b3aa645f18,Chindirala  Sasank

6,"Yo, dude!
First of all, where is my memoir!?
Secondly, I would like to talk to you about a lot of things, obviously making MTH courses and other courses bearable in one of them, but also for bringing your unconditioned positivity and so hopeful enthusiastic attitude of yours. Thank you for listening to my rants from time to time, and thank you for keeping a place for me in your groups TT_TT. You are really a hardworking and chaapu guy! 
And thank you for being a common friend and resolving our disputes. Though my first impression of you was that you are really judgy towards me, and that's why I avoided interaction with you, I guess I am past that now. Even though you might now consider me as a ""friend,"" but you are somehow now a part of the bubbled world that I like to live in. 
Cheers to one more year of college to go! let's rock the placements together!! Hopefully, you will try valorant sometime at least after getting a great job! hehe.
Stay safe and positive.:)

It is so difficult to write memoir for you... it seems like I can anytime reach to you and we all (GOK) are never going to separate... Aur there sath toh sab kuch kar liya hai maine 😛😁. God, I still cringe towards that night.. but it was with you that is the only reason I don't wake up at night randomly cringing about that night. You are the most genuine and open minded and overall chill person I know yar... I don't know you know that or not but I really respect you for your calmness and savageness both at the same time... my student in PJs who has beaten me in it now... heads off.
Don't you ever forget about me, okay? Love you girl!
Let us all book flat and live together yar!  😊😊😊",Neha  Chauhan,False,60c257bc659165b3aa6460b4,Maitreyee  Srivastava

Yar tere se jab bhi baat hoti hai accha hi lagta hai... I remember the last time we met at Yahika's birthday celebration... ate se hi tere sath dance karne lag jana... that's just the kind of vibes you give dude... you are really nice and friendly. And that's why you are common friend with anyone I know. XD. Mast hai yar tu... I first get to know you because of yashika... and in first year had fun with you both in silly activities. 
Tere sath toh volleyball bhi khela hai XD you remember that night tournament? mast khelti hai yar tu volleyball bhi... aur logon ko yakin hi nhi hota hai. XD
Milte hain yar kabhi agr jaipur ana hua toh ya tu kabhi dehradun ghumne ayi toh.

I get to know you form TA project... if you remember... we got second place XD. You are cool dude... get to know this after doing common courses with you. Your anime recommendation was weird... XD but keep them coming. You are a real weeb as told by your (ex)roommate. You watch a lot of anime even more than me (and I watch a lot). XD. You were time to time honest and willing to become friends I really appreciate that about you.

You are one of the persons I wish I have talked to more in college, but we had different friends and interests. Still, on the last day when you came to say goodbye in the mess, it was really lovely. TT_TT
I hope I get to meet you properly and talk to you more someday.

13,"Yo mate!
If you haven't repeatedly tried to talk after snt summer project I would have completely ignored you that was just the kind of impression you had left on me. But somehow we kept talking because of sports and resolved things. It was an enriching experience taking with you, you are really talented and smart mate. Thanks for hearing my suggested songs... your suggested song was nice too. 
I hope we get to meet on campus, fellow dual matey.

Dude, you are really cool and smart. I got to know this from our recent common courses, which got easier because of your help. (CSXX ka assignment kiya kya? 😅). Arigato. It was fun sharing BT of courses with you :P. Hope we get to meet in college soon, Dual buddy! :)

My first-year roomie and sister... My first impression of you was that you were really friendly and socially smart. Someone I looked up to as I was really shy and introverted and most of the time didn't know how to interact with people. Chapu toh hai hi tu from dance to classes. Thanks for the lessons and doubt clearing in CHM/CHE courses. We also had taken CHM102 doubt clearing session... I was too nervous, but you handled it like a pro! It was a fun and enriching experience to interact with you 😊.
I hope we sisters get to meet someday after college and covid. 
Take care!",Neha  Chauhan,True,60c22771659165b3aa6459d9,Yashika
