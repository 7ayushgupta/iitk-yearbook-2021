0,"Hi Fren😁
Still grateful to Yashika and Utsav for introducing me to your group. Kaafi charche sune the tumhare in dono se XD. It has been a pleasure meeting you—the ""not-so-quiet, cheerful, entertaining, and bakchod fren"" of mine🤩. 
I don't remember our first interaction, but I'm sure it must have been in the library because we've met there mostly XD. You're the only person jiske photo reviews are more pleasing than the photo itself😂. Aise hi reviews dete rhna bs. I bet I won't be able to count the names you've given me, but thanks for calling me Monisha. Keep sharing your covers, memes and lovely playlist as always. Peer pressure m aake tareef nhi karungi Nandini ki tarah😛 . 
I wish I could spend some more time with you, but it's not the end yet. I'm definitely going to go on a super fun trip to North India with you as soon as possible. 
Till then, take care. 
Miss you<3

I wish I could turn back time and meet you sooner. That way, I could spend a little more time with you. I can't even imagine how I would've survived MSE and college without you. I still remember your smile when I told you about my branch change, and I literally knew that I will be able to go through it. From sharing the same department to sharing life secrets, we've come a long way, and I couldn't be more thankful to have this cute-chubby-witty-sassy person in my life. Classes k baad ki chai, labs ki masti, lab assignments ka rona, tera raat ko 2 bje aake Maggie ki demand krna aur mere room ki tareef will be missed a lot :(
Thank you for always being you. Thank you for always being there to listen to me. Life wouldn't have been the same without you. I guess I'll cry my eyes out If I write anymore. 
Hope I meet you real soon and cook amazingly delicious maggie for you( is baar kettle wali nhi hogi :P). Stay safe and take care. And just remember that I'm just one call away. 
Love you <3 <3

안녕!
It all started from A607. From next-door neighbour in the wing to best of friends, we've come a long way indeed. Being navodayans provided us tonnes of conversations over school life, food and friends. I still remember how miserably we failed the plan of being roommates (including Yashika). God, we were hilarious😂. But ig not being roomies didn't really matter when it came to our friendship. Those unplanned treats, sharing wardrobe, endless gushing over K-drama Oppas, and cycle rides would never be fun without you. I'm super proud that we introduced Yashika to K-world😌. I've definitely hit the jackpot in friendship, and you guys are the proof. It's been a fantastic journey, and we're gonna make it even more fun from now on.
Let's plan a trip to S. Korea super soon. Kya pta HYBE m job mil jaaye vahin ( I'm gonna DM BH for sure if they drop any vacancies for BTS staff this time😝). Yashika ko bhi leke chalenge aur China chhod k aayenge usko vahan se LOL 
I'm making you visit Rajasthan as soon the situation gets better because I'm missing you a lot. See you soon and yes... Thank you for everything.

It's actually been 5 years! I vividly remember the day I met you in Dakshana, and I still can't believe that our fantasy of going to the same college came true. I was so happy ( even more shocked) when I saw you in front of the hall office on my first day at IITK. It's been one hell of a ride, and you've always been my saviour throughout. And yes, our random 2 AM conversations about literally everything, including friends, food, fashion, crushes, have made it so much more tolerable and entertaining. Ice cream and Meggie sessions were icing on the cake XD ( I'll always miss this). 
You have my heart for being the most dramatic and self-obsessed ( in a good way) BFF I could ever have. And yeah, I'll keep advising you on your relationship issues ( you know kitni pro hu m isme LOL) 
Thanks a lot for making me grow so much as a person and as a friend during these 5 years. I'm going to brag about having this "" Smart-Gorgeous-Badass Bestie"" for the rest of my life XD. Ig itni tareef kaafi h, Baaki tareef milegi tb karungi.
