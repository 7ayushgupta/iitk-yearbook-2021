You were one of my very first friends on campus. Coincidentally being together in same batch in all the labs and even in cpa, pe we got to spent a lot of good time together in first year. 
Our ritambhara gossips, daily chit-chats in mess and the crazy dance sessions are some memories that I will keep with me forever.
Thanks to you for being such a good neighbor(I don't think maine apne room me itna time spend kiya hoga jitna tumhare me kiya tha ).
Hope to meet you soon !!! (and yeah we will always be in touch)
All the best for your journey ahead <3",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60bb7998659165b3aa644fd9,Abha  Tamrakar
1,"Hello Madam !!
From being my first friend in college to getting placed in the same company (and even in the same location) <3 
It has been 4 long years ... Never thought I would spend so much time with you. (even being in different departments)
Have so many memories to share but one of the most memorable is our trip to Banglore (yaad h excitement me tu ticket bhul gayi thi aur fir kitna juggad karke nikalna pada tha)
Thank you for always supporting me emotionally and being there for me every time I needed it.
Stay amazing as always !!!
PS -: No Goodbyes as our journey continues ....",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60a59048819323d199d48714,Monika  Rathore

I remember we first met in takneek for a robotics event and the nightout with you was pretty fun. (also got to know how fun-loving person you are)
After that never got a chance to spend much time but jane se phele your last goodbye made me soo emotional.
All the best for all your future endeavours :)
Be in touch <3 !!!",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60a62a55819323d199d48b69,Maitreyee  Srivastava
4,"Hey Nikita !!
Although we have met and talked several times before, but 4 saal me itna rapport kabhi nahi bana jitna last month me bana.
I really miss those long walks, our plans to explore the campus ( which failed everytime we made ), and those amazing photoshoots.
Will always remember our crazy bulla sessions and the way we used to share our secrets.
Thanks a lot for making my last month so memorable 
All the best for all your future endeavours :)
Be in touch <3 !!",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60a57478819323d199d48685,Nikita  Singh
5,"Hey Prajwal !!
I still remember how serious we all were initially for the summer project but ended up doing jugaad just to complete the project somehow 😂 . It was fun working with you and yeah after that we have done so many courses together. Special thanks to you and Ravi for helping me in OS assignments(otherwise, I don't know how I would have managed them 😅)
All the best for your journey ahead <3. Hopefully, our paths cross sometime in the future (maybe in Microsoft....).",Nalli  Bhavita,False,60bb2afd659165b3aa644fce,Prajwal H G
6,"Hi my princess haddi !! ( 😉 pls don't get offended )
I had never thought we'd ever be friends in my first year, but we ended up being the best. I honestly don't remember how or when I met you, but I am grateful that I did.
My go-to person (even for the silliest things). Thanks a lot for patiently listening to all my boring stories ( knowingly and unknowingly, you are the only one with whom I have shared everything)
I will never forget those killer expressions (sometimes they even scare me  😂 )
All of those movie nights and bulla sessions are memories I will cherish for the rest of my life.
Stay amazing as always !!! May all your wishes come true and may you achieve everything you desire.
Hope to meet you soon! and love you a lot 😘

7,"Hey Yashika !!
I still remember how in the first year we used to fight and argue even over the silliest things but don't know when and how we became such best friends. 
And yeah, we haven't talked for days and even months but still, our friendship grew stronger and stronger. (I believe our friendship wasn't an accident nor happened for a reason but happened as it was destined ☺️)
I could always open my heart to you (with even the pettiest thoughts because I knew you would never judge me 🙂)
Always loved hearing your stories (esp about your crushes lol 😜)
All those movie nights, random bulla sessions, and our late-night cravings are some memories that I will keep with me forever.
I used to and will always look upto how hardworking and dedicated a person you are.
Thank you for always supporting me emotionally and being there for me every time I needed it. Stay amazing as always !!!
May all your wishes come true, and may you achieve everything you desire. Love you a lot !! ❤️
See you soon in Hyderabad.....
PS -: why am I always the last one to know about your secrets :'(",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60c1368a659165b3aa6453c1,Yashika
