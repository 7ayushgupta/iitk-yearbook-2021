In 4 saalo me na jaane kitne matches found hue, ya kitne shows aur artists ke suggestion share hue, ya kitne events pe humlog sab kuchh bhula kar nachte rahe..
I dont remember the number times we went for those late night canteens or the number of times we had a debate on random topics.
But I do know, ki yaar mast nikle ye 4 saal. 

And yes, that Delhi trip was wild and could have been better, wahi Mussoorie trip bhi yaadgaar tha. Ab dekhte hai, whats next...

Stay in touch and CHAAPTE raho....",Piyush  Singh,True,60a64bb8819323d199d48dc1,Subham Kumar Hota

2,"Yo Blak, sabse pahle to thank you for introducing KPOP.. We have had differences in the past but I really think that you have now become an amazing person. Over these 4 years, you made me try several thing which I would have never done on my own. It was a great time these 4 years, those games we played and the trips... 
And yes trip ka zaroor chalenge.. Gaming Cafe, I m in...",Piyush  Singh,True,60a666fa819323d199d48f99,Shreyas  Potdar
3,"Bhai, being form the same dept, apan ne kuchh zada hi experience saath me share kiya hai.. wo prof ke pakau lectures, winters ke morning classes, random assignments and reports jugadna and what not.. Thank you for always being there.. 
Iske alawa to bhai all those gaming days and nights, canteen me paise udane ke baad ke regrets and what not. On a second thought, apan ne itne kaand kiye hai saath me ki its hard to pinpoint any..
And yeah, I do get angry sometimes but only at the ones who I think are really close to me, so sorry for my anger issues..
Aur rahi baat trip ki to pahle permission jugado.. mere side se problem nhi hai although I m fine with fruit juice for the time being..",Piyush  Singh,True,60a65b48819323d199d48ecf,Sudhanshu Pratap Singh
