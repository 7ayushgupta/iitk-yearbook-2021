2,"Hey, Although we met few months back but our friendship grew exponentially. The goa trip was the best with you guys along🤩.Although you were a little hesitant initially before driving, but you are a pro👌🏻 in it. Back to campus time was the best spent with you all, be it playing UNO, listening to music, exploring campus or late night talks. Outreach's rooftop was the best hangout place. 
Looking forward to plan something and meet you all again. All the best for your future endeavours.❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a4fd1a819323d199d482d8,Atishay  Shrivastava
3,"Yo Banner, u were a roommate who everyone should get. You helped me a lot during these years from studying TA101 to coding to lif101 in CC before endsems. You were an asset to me. You are the most intelligent person I have ever met in my life so far.   Stop trying to break into my devices😑. You are a genius. But you have a second side too, which not everyone knows 😏.You owe me many treats including that fiitjee scholarship 😝. We will meet sometime somewhere, just don't forget me. 🤓",Saransh  Nadda,False,60a2b523819323d199d47df9,Ayan  Banerjee
4,"Hey Deeksha, last few days in the campus were very memorable. It was so good of you to take us to campus tours and help us explore new places, be it oxidation pond or environment lab fountain. Our group has some exclusive photos in front of the library in Japanese garden 😝. From outreach roof top to Annabelle doll in director's bungalow you showed us all 👻☠️. All the best for your future endeavours.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60c258d3659165b3aa6460db,Deeksha  Yadav
5,"Bro, many of our conversations were on the mess table. Started taken brown breads seriously on knowing 3 gms of  protein in it from you. 😂. Photoshoot was so much fun with you.

7,"Yo! At first we met during fashion show. Then, we were in the same team in Udghosh which we successfully conducted amidst lots of fun. The dart 🎯 games in B107, interviewing junior execs in Hall 1 common room are some of the fun memories with you. Then there was this Banaras photowalk. It was really fun watching movies and going out for group dinners(specially NH91😂). We were somewhat in touch throughout the 4 years at campus. All the best for your future endeavours.🤘🏻",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a2db93819323d199d47e4c,Nupur  Mehra
8,"Yo Pinku, ab tumhare liye kya hi likhu yr. Did you ever count?  It has been 10 long years of our friendship. From being classmates to being batch mates in college, we have seen it all. Together we have enjoyed and hungout for so much time in this campus. All those night outs and dinners in canteen or restaurants (Mainly NH91😂) to visiting Z square often. Those nightouts at the events ground during fests, exploring the campus at night, hanging out in OAT and CCD 🥺 will always be missed. We have many more trips pending.  Plenty of more years to come. Tumse to milna julna laga hi rahega. ❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a15d7e819323d199d47c7a,Prakhar  Srivastava
9,"Are bhai bhai bhai... Still remember our first talk, in gym when I asked you to demonstrate triceps exercises. Tab se thodi  bahut chit chat hoti hi rahti hai. What a coincidence it was to meet you all in Goa. It felt like we are in campus and there is this fest going on😆. Bas vahan kahi ka program sath nahi ban paya🥺. But I hope we will meet sometime somewhere in future. All the best for all your ambitions. ❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a635e1819323d199d48c12,Raghav  Singh
10,"Yo Rahul, It was really nice knowing you. Didn't expect ki itna bolte hoge tum 😂. Bahut fearless ho yr tum. The capacity of your drinking  and post results make me say tum to bade heavy driver ho bhai. 😆 We really have spent some good time with you on the trip as well as back on campus. Don't take too much stress on seeing roti's stonks going up 🤭. I will miss all the fun we did together in campus. We are definitely gonna meet soon and plan for more trips together. All the best for your journey ahead ❤️.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a64759819323d199d48d6b,Rahul  Jindal
11,"Hello Riya. It was very difficult writing a memoir for you that's why waited till the very last day 😐. We have been together since class 11th. Done our coaching, jee preparations and then college together. You were always there for me throughout my ups and downs. We met almost every single day and spent every memorial moment of our college life together. Our normal day at college was like waking up, going for classes together (except first year), hanging out at CCD, oat, old or new shopC, yours or mine place, etc etc...  and most importantly figuring out in which canteen we had to go for the dinner😂. From studying with you in the library or should I say CCD 😬 to doing our labs together, I just cannot forget those moments ever. Conducting Udghosh with you was so much fun and exciting. Spent so many sleepless nights together during fests and enjoying them to the fullest. From frequent visits to NH91, Anaicha and Z-square (or exploiting them to be precise😆😅) to exploring many new restaurants with you was so much fun. We have watched so many movies together 🍿. Thanks for always helping me in the shopping 🛍️, you really have a very good fashion sense👌🏻. We had so many trips together and many many more are pending 🤭. Last one month in the  campus was best utilized with you, from exploring new places to trying out new things like pool, wall climbing, etc. Thank you for helping me in the academics. 7 years already done and many many more to come❤️. As far as memoir is concerned, ""I can do this all day"" 🤪.  Exiting here, so as to leave you with something to write 😏.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60c1dd49659165b3aa6455e5,Riya  Katiyar
12,"Hey bro, the small talks outside labs, the discussions during the internship phase and the mass copying during the environment lab is something I remember you by. All the best for your future endeavours and hoping for some amazon vouchers in return 🤓. Lets see where we meet again.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a2c3d7819323d199d47e23,Rohan Gupta (P Kumar)
13,"Hey Shivansh, from being my Wingi who was irritating for me 😫 in first year to  landing up in same group in geotechnical course, I have seen both sides of you 😐.  But surely that group was the best among all I had been in. We did so much fun during our lab, partial credit goes to the best location we got to work in (which includes CC canteen 😜). Thank you for helping me out in my doubts and doing assignments. I wish you were here when the college reopened. We will schedule another video call soon.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a17f28819323d199d47c90,Shivansh  Tripathi
14,"Hey Chapu Roomie, it was really nice sharing a room with you. We had lots of talk and fun together. I realised that we three were destined to become roomies after we three got the same marks in CHM102A in midsems 🤓(Quite a rare thing). I will never forget the taste of your homemade mathris. I want to confess that I  used to sneek out some in your absence 😐. All the best for your future endeavours. We will meet sometime soon.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a2b04f819323d199d47ddb,Snehan
15,"Hello Swati. Yeah, we have met few months back but it doesn't feel like that now. Trip with you all guys was the best. From playing UNO to watching movies and hanging out with you guys was awesome and I will never forget. Remember your hilarious act you did in RM when the doors were closed 😂 still makes me laugh a lot. Looking forward to hangout with you both in near future and more trips pending. 
You both together really make a good couple ❤️. All the best for your future endeavours.🤘🏻",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a63fb8819323d199d48cca,Swati  Upadhyay
16,"Tushy, remember when we first met at Ashish sir's coaching, tumhare scooty ki keys dikki mai band ho gayi thi 🙄. Uske bad direct orientation mai mile the. But it was Udghosh which brought us close. Hail Udghosh 😅. From spending so much time in H1/B107 to organising the fest successfully as a senior executive we have spent soo much time together. All the dinner outings, treats, hangouts at CCD and oat etc. etc.  we used to have so much fun. Trip to Jaipur and Banaras(U were very annoying there🙄) was special too. You owe me many treats, just waiting for the pandemic to get over 😏. Also we have a pending trip. Tum to pass mai hi rahte ho yr pick-up karne aa jana once this is over.😜",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a16b58819323d199d47c80,Tushank  Gupta
17,"Bro, although we have not talked before but meeting you guys in Goa was the best. Couldn't believe our stay would also be the same Kamat holiday homes 😂. We could have planned something together but you guys skipped mornings 😂. Nightlife kafi enjoy kari vahan 😏. All the best for your future endeavours. 🤟🏻",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a64af2819323d199d48db5,Umang  Malik
18,"Yo Uttu, I hope you are doing well. Not seen you since long. It was so good to work with you, conducting Udghosh. It was really nice of you to come and attend those birthday celebrations even those were amid exams. I still remember your pole dance which you did around me (aka pole)🙄 in FMC room. The movies we watched and the dinners we had will be always remembered. We will definitely meet sometime somewhere in near future. All the best for your UPSC preperations.❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a62e11819323d199d48b9e,Utkarsh  Singh
