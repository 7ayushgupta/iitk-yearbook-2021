It's strange how we find such great friends in people we didn't expect to.
Thanks for always being there to listen to me  especially when I would come to you to rant about the shit in elections.
Keep up with your conviction for self-improvement; it's inspiring.

1,"TA ho ya Abhishek Chaudhary ka project:
Prof or Guide : Bahut hi bakchod project banayenge hum
Aditya : Hao.
Aditya (after some time) : Humko bas project khatam karna hai!

Lekin jo bhi kaho...TA ka project tha bakchod!

Abhishek Chaudhary ka project bhi kya chutiyaap tha; 2 mahine bas Data collect kiya aur Sir ko gyaan pelte hue suna. 
Hum dono : Sir, kuch remote areas ka data to nahi mil raha.
Prof : data nahi mil raha to tum dono ko wahan bhej denge, data lete aana...

Tere room par kitni bakchodi ki hai...

Kitni saari yaadein hai apni; Bithoor ki wo cycle trip, Delhi ki wo roadtrip, Parathe waali gali aur Gurudware me humne itna khaa kaise liya!
UP Singh ke saath dinner pe us conversation me to alag hi maze aaye the!

Apne late night assignments were a different memory altogether! Har baar discuss karne pe hum dono me se kisi ka kuch na kuch galat nikal hi jaata tha! 

Duniya-jahaan ko gaaliyaan dete hue mujhe sunne ke liye Thanks (although most of the time tere paas koi option tha bhi nahi) ",Shivansh  Tripathi,True,60a48f0d819323d199d48144,Aniket  Raj

4,"Yo Saini!

At Kanpur Railway station, I checked the hall allocation list, my roommate's name was Abhishek Saini....Hmmm... Cool, milte hai isse!

Because of my own narcissism (Sorry for that), we started off with a communication gap and it prevailed for a long time... Dil bahut halka ho gaya tha when I finally apologized to you for not being a good roommate!

Dil ke bahut acche bande ho tum.

Yaad hai jab light chali gayi thi aur hum A5 me laundon ko daraane gaye the (mai white bedsheet odhkar bhoot bana tha) aur ek senior nikal ke aa gaya tha ek room se...""Y17 ho?....chalo nikalo""
...jo bhi ho, A5 waalon ki phat to gayi thi.

B6 ki roof pe kitni saari memories hai... Baarish ke baad ka sunset dekhna, Nitik aur wingies ke saath horror storytelling and some random bakchodi.

Blue world ki kahani bhi alag hi hai... especially IIT Gate pe mera first time beer try karna (yaar koi acchi beer suggest karte...Kingfisher bhi koi suggestion hai). Kitna darte hue pi thi maine, ki campus pahunchne tak bhand na ho jaaun; aur wo thi bhi itni zyada (lekin bhand phir bhi nahi hua)
and then the walk back to Hall (wo bhi seedhe seedhe nahi kiya gaya hum logon se). 

And remember the freshers' treasure hunt? Bas final destination par pahunch gaye, wahi badi baat thi! Also, Odyssey ka treasure hunt bhi kitna mazedaar tha, diwaar se clue waala paper hi phaad diya tha humne ;).

Aisi hi kitni saari yaadein hai tere saath; big and small, bitter and sweet!

Cheers to all the memories together.

Remember first year me tumhari skirt me wo photo...us entry ko accept karwaane ke liye bhi mehnat karni padi thi (All seniors were like : Abe ye to skirt lag hi nahi rahi)

Sorry to disappoint you everytime jab tum poochne aate the ki assignment hua ki nahi...aur mera reply hamesha yahi rehta tha ki nahi hua (itni jaldi kaun assignment karta hai yaar!)

Had some great memories with you; GI lab ki lambi conversations, CC Canteen ke dhokle and our video calls! Apni conversations ki range ki koi limit nahi hai!

Thanks for always being there for me!
Itna saari memories hai apni; Wing, Antaragni, MT, Blue World aur na jaane kya kya.
Lekin sabse yaadgar memory rahegi wo Antaragni me cycle ke confusion waali. Maine cycle borrow ki, phir chodh aaya, phir tum utha laaye, phir mai kisi aur ki utha laaya; itna zyada confusion tha. Details theek se yaad nahi; isiliye bola tha isko likh lete hai kahin. Ab lag raha hai ki likh hi lena chahiye tha.
