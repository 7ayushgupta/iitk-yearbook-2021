Mera isse pehle koi bhi roomie nahi tha (hostel me nahi rha tha na mai) , You first me fucking first roommate . Bhai pehli baar dekha tha na toh full on gaand phat gayi rhi ki yeh toh bc giant hai  ,yeh gaand maar dega but fir jab maine tumarha baat karne ka style suna toh i was like yeh toh bhai full on softy hai! But no MC i was wrong , bhai shivansh kya MC vaali harkate kari hai tune , BUT BUT BUT all just changed so much when you came into Nandu's and my room and said ""Sorry"" , Man it was so emtional to me!! I realised the amazing change which occurred in you! You became such an amazing person , helping people , staying in their bad times. You became the person with whom i can be comfortable with, to whom i can share stuff! 
If i talk about some fun memories toh then i would mention about C6 ka MKB karna , bhai and kya be bhoot banke baith gyaa tha beech me , saale chapal khali batao uss din , hadh hai bhai!  
Your mango treats were so amazing <3. I know you are preparing hard for UPSC and i am sure you gonna become (obviously because you are hard working , true to yourself and regular) , but you have already earned my respect and love bruh! You will definitely be missed and agar same cities me honge toh pakka milenge bro <3 and obviously mere dil me humesha tere liye ek special jagah rahegi

Apparently starting me toh mujhe hi pata tha tu kitna bada harami hai , bc kitna politics khelta hai but so glad you left that path at early stage . Infact you , me and nandu left that path for our betterment! Bhai odyssey , mini miltia , Yellow and brownie (XD XP) (legends of B6 hahaha) , Ramaiya ka khana (mujhe hotel and ek ramaiya jaise jagah ka naam yaad nahi aarha toh ramiya hi likh diya) , your birthday tradition of you running away in campus from GPL - ""because rivaz hai !!"" XD, bhai kya toh simp kiya hai humne kuch seniors and kya toh bezatti bhi kari hai <3. Really IITK would feel incomplete without you. My man , my bruh !!
