1,"Gawwwds!!!!
What a person and what a talent. Padhai, gaana aur ab to party(xD) bhi kuch bhi karwalo har cheez mein chaapu. I wish we had bonded a bit earlier but ""All's well that ends well"". Are Hindu Sher to bolna hi bhul gaya. Itna mast laga tha ek Hindu Sher se milke. Same ideologies and same concerns(yaad hai first year ki debate with Yogi, gaand hi fat gayi thi gale ki lol). 
Bas gawds aage jaake bhul na jaana.
P.S: Ye jo final year mein evolve hue ho na aap, gaand fat gaya dekh ke.

2,"Are Yogi bhai!!!
The real party animal now of the wing. Bhai tujhe main kabhi predict hi nhi kar paaya. 1st year mein mujhe mazakiya laga, 2nd year mein politics mein interested laga aur 3rd year se to politics mein hi aa gaya (cough) Senator sahab (cough). But I never thought I would bond with you as we have now because well many things(difference in opinions, difference in ideology and THAT fight in the mess). But bhai jo hua accha hi hua I guess. Best of luck future ke liye bhai. Pyar aur izzat hamesha bani rahegi.
Milna zaroor.
Not a Goodbye.
