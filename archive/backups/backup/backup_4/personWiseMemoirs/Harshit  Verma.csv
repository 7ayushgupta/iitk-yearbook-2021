Dear Akshat,
It was a very good time of around 3 years which we had spent together. That ""Woooooo"" voice will be missed a lot. Still the party of ESC201A is pending, and I am writing this on my diary. Thank you for saving our 31680 Rs., else meri gaand tod di jaati. It was a moment of grief that you weren't able to come with us to Goa, but we did Rajasthan together.
Spending time playing Among Us, was the best part of that quarantine period. Making fake tinder IDs xD although you should say sorry to that guy named Utkarsh ""bechare k 2 baar lol"".
All in all, it was great time spent together. I kindly request you to please stay in touch and meet whenever you are in Kanpur or I am in Delhi, so that we can live once again on nostalgia.

PHY103 tutorial was going on, you were sitting with Sardar Paji, my wingie, I sat a row next to you, and then Paji called me and said "" abe bsdk idhar aake beth "", then he told me, ""Ye bhi Kanpur se h, aur ye CHE k h"". I was like wow man what a coincidence, pr kata to bechare k bhi h lol. 

And then the difference between your row and my row converged to zero.

It was quite a lot of fun in these four years. Those lectures, where you taught me how to use mobile during the class, yeah its quite a fun sitting in front row and being online at the same time. Internship time was a bit tough, but that is what life is, it has its ups and downs. But seriously that was a funny incident, jb ITC k ppt mein I said ki jo khade hogye unka shortlist nhi hua :| :| :|, though it was a sarcasm.

Those endless sleepless nights at library, going to Hall 2 canteen, roaming around library to hunt for other CHE batchmates, those late library sessions, doing assignments together was the beautiful life in the campus.

Ab wo August January wale kaand k to kya batau, but jo bhi hua accha hua. I do care sometimes about August but none for January. Jo ki recordings mein ekdum clear tha. xD

I still remember I called you that Antaragni night, being drunk, spoken everything lmao. The next day was fun.

Aur koi baat nhi prom night k liye nhi jaa paye but ase hi try kro, still got 1 year left. ;)

Thanks for listening my RR throughout these years, and many many more years ahead, kyunki abhi to bs shuruaat h.

We spent a lot of moments together, from the labs of Vishal to labs of Control, and then this pandemic struck. I initially got you as an irritating, hyperactive and over conscious type of person, but still it was fun being friend with you, I don’t know why, but somehow, I just managed to survive with you. xD xD
I will always miss those heated bullshit arguments that we used to have, which never reached a conclusion. Those poor jokes from you which can made anyone cry, bullying professors and those theories towards life.
Accha, for that imposter kaand, I literally do not know how I was involved, I can only say sorry for that because even I am not aware how those things got fired up. That incident, I guess ruined everything between us, but I am fine, if this is what makes u satisfied. That is what life is, you can have anything in life, but you cannot have everything that you want.
Nonetheless, it was fun being with you for almost like 2 years. If I will ever write a book on my college life, you will surely be a chapter in it, may be two :P. It finally goes this way, not how long, but how well you have lived, is the main thing, I am sure these two years are enough, if not further.
