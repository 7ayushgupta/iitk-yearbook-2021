I fondly remember our Bangalore days. It was really fun to be with you all. Mujhe instantly pata chal gaya tha that you're a very humble guy! You really love taking photos and posing for them :-P. Mysore mei we really had fun recreating memes through pictures! Usse pehele apni kabhi baat nhi hui thi same hall hone par bhi but after that we really hit it off in that trip! Chaapuness toh extremities par toh hai hi but you're easily approachable and fun to be with. All the best man for your new journey! Cheers!",Utkarsh,True,60c103bd659165b3aa6452da,Harsh  Agarwal

We might have seen each other many times in these four years, but we really had contacted this year. The sam interaction at the campus would have been really cool. From what I can make out, you're a really dedicated person and possess a wide array of knowledge. Talking at lengths is quite easy with you because of how refined your thoughts are. All the best for the GSoC; I hope you'll be able to convince a person to join open-source as well as I had convinced a bunch! Let's definitely try to meet on campus!

Bhai tere saath kuch aisa hi rha hai, pehele kya the aur ab kaise ho gaye. The only thing positive, when I shifted in 3rd year, was only you. Jo interaction hua, sabse deep terese hua. Kaafi mysterious aur deep bande ho, aur sabki crisis mei bhaut madad karte ho, yeh batane ki jaroorat nahi, dekha hai maine. Sahi hai bhai bade aadmi toh banoge hi, usse zyaada imaandar aadmi banoge. Baaki bhai apna bhi memoir ho chuka hai badiya sa. All the best bhai, jaroor touch mei rahenge. Idhar aate jaate rhena.

Kaafi chill maarte ho, aur doosro ko bhi karate ho! 🤣 Lucknow trip toh alag hi fun thi bhai! Wo pizza nights, random stories mei bahut maza aata tha! Abhi jab indore aaye the we tried to meet you but nahi bann paaya. Koi nahi, jaisa bola trip toh honi hai 😅, saath mei chalna! All the best!",Utkarsh,True,60a6337d819323d199d48bf0,Parth  Luwaria

Mujhe hamesha se lagta hai toh secret genious hai! Jis kaam mei tera mann lag jaata hai usse bhaut creatively karta hai! I still remember that intern bt night and that peaceful placement night where you just slept on the group call. That really speaks mammoth about your transition. Ab yeh naye field mei tu aa gaya hai toh badiya kariyo aur tauji ki chaaya mei toh ho hi. Recent MP trip mei bhi bhaut maza aaya tha guptaji ki mauj mei aap bhi jab shaamil ho jaate hai! 
I just love your banter with yashraj, gazab entertainment ho jaata hai xD! All the best bhai! Touch mei rahenge.",Utkarsh,True,60c21db7659165b3aa645919,Priyanshu  Saxena
6,"Bhai Sabhay!
One of the first friends honge mere IIT K campus mei Yashraj ke saath. Ek toh tum bhai the aur TT bhi khelte the toh aise aur baat cheet hui. Shayd yaad hoga tumhe sabse peheli treat tumne hi di thi DoAA canteen mei :-P. Mujhe abhi bhi yaad MTH101 ka vo vector spaces ka question jo tumne galat bataya tha :-P.
Tum bhi bhaut badle ho bhai, aur kaafi acche ke liye badle ho aur ab chill karna seekh gaye ho xD. Tum mehnat karne se bilkul nahi darte aur apna hamesha 110% diya hai. I sometimes feel bad that you had an unfair share of bad-luck aur yaa jo tum deserve karte ho vo nahi ho paaya. But bhai everything is sorted in the end are I guess tumhaare liye ab sabse best hi hua hai. I feel that you have very staunch ideals aur jisko shayd tum inherently bahut maante ho. Aur kabhi bhi apna displeasure kisi ko nahi batate, bas shaant rhete ho. So I am sorry kabhi mazak mazak mei tumhe bura laga ho. Trips mei bahut fun hota hai aur hamesha kuch unique hi rheta hai. Sabke saath adjust kar lete ho aur bas khaana accha ho jaaye toh tum khush ho jaaoge :-P. 
Tumhaari branch alag thi, mere bhi alag thi. Mera 5-year hone ki vajah se cheeze sync mei nahi ho paayi, but jo bhi courses kiye hai tumhaare saath, bahut maza aaya hai. Apne bhi ups and downs rhe hai but abhi kaafi time se contact phir se ho gaya hai and I am really grateful for that. I would be the probably one of them jisko bhaut bura laga tha tum nhi aa paaye the and I even refused to take your room for that. It now feels good jisse mei EE se related kuch baat ho jaati hai aur guidance mil jaati hai. Help karne mei tum bhi Naman jaise ho, sabki help karte ho. Thode competitive ho :-P, but vo shayd tumhaare andar best laata hai. But bhai kabhi bhi so called failure ko bahut dil pe mat le lena, jo mujhe lagta hai tum le lete ho, but bahar se nahi dikhaate.
Baaki aur bhi cheezein hai jo rhe gayi hongi, vo Alwar aake karenge. All the best bhai, just believe in yourself!
Baaki toh sab ""Badhiya"" hai.",Utkarsh,True,60bf7371659165b3aa6450d3,Sabhay  Jain
7,"Hey man,

I am glad that we had a good time together. I really loved that you could part of our trips and wholeheartedly enjoyed yourself with us. Sabki preconceptions hoti hai logo ko lekar meri bhi thi 1st year but man you have changed a lot, and changed for good. Bhaut maza aata hai, you always try to include yourself aur bhaut time spend kiya hai.  Badiya hai bhai ek saal toh aur hai, phirse milenge research ka sochte rhenge. Tera toh ho jaayega, mera bhi guide karva diyo :-P . Phirse trip hogi plan sab chalenge saath. The last 1.5 months were gold yaar. We really had fun. Your streamlined attitude is something I admire and learnt many things. Cricket is always better with you and your anecdotes (you know what I am talking about :-P) always makes me laugh, and thank you for always repeating that for me. All the best man, hopefully phirse milenge, campus nahi toh trip par. Have a good time! :-D",Utkarsh,True,60be7389659165b3aa64506d,Sathvik  Bhagavan

I really had some good discussions with you, which I am glad that connect continually got transformed! Bete Mauj kara di lol! Stay safe and be happy!

10,"Bhai Suyash!
Even I felt that yeh printed mei hone waala hai phirse likhte hain!
Bhai mei kya bolu, jo kaam tune kiya hai, of highest standards kiya hai aur literally gold hai. Matlab yaar kya the bhai 1st year mei, sirf banter chalta tha xD baaki bas namaste sir! Phir tauji ki madad se hum sab log ek wing mei aa gaye toh thoda aur jaana. You were hell busy in your 2nd year toh thoda sabse time kam spend hua but bhai I would say that was the turning point in your life. Matlab bhai jo bhi mei change hua hu, usme tera bhaut bada haath hai. I still remember on casually cycling to KD ki you randomly said that ""Tu itna accha dost nahi hai bhai abhi toh"", toh I literally felt that. Isko badiya se dost toh banana hai yaar :-P. Phir kya, jo bhi tere saath opportunties mili, hamesha kari hai. I believe in failures but what I learnt from your essentially is always give 110% in your efforts, just be all in and play all your cards. And that really helped me how to approach problems and opportunities in life. I would say apna bond had gone through an evolution process, the thoughts evolving to be the fittest. Tu aur tau jab aaye the delhi mei recently bhaut accha laga tha bhai chalo sab saath mei jaa rhe hain. Aur kya hi mazze aaye yaar abhi campus, sab kuch naap liya bhai! Buchas toh bhai apna ek alag hi companion rha hai, bhaut mazze kare hai saath mei. Tu Mech ke liye itna passionate hai bhai aise environment mei toh mei samajh chuka hu jo tu karega usme sirf chaapega. Bhai mere paas shabd nahi bach rhe hain bolne ke what your friendship means to me. We feel grateful bhai tujhe maza hamaare saath hi aata hai. I really feel good tera YashRaj ke saath bhaut sahi bond hai, usko tere jaisa koi nahi samajhta. Trips mei toh bhai mauj hui hai bas bhai! Phirse ek aur plan karni bhai. What I really love between our discussions is that ki bas haan mei haan nahi milate, jo sahi lagta hai vo bolte hain, aur doosre ko poora samajhate hain ki vo sahi kyun hai. Isse hamesha thoughts etched in memory ho jaate hain. Thoda load aur recently discovered OCD par dhyaan rakhiyo :-D. 
Chal bhai abhi koshish karunga Alwar aane ki toh terese aur Sabhay ke saath masti karenge. Baaki bhai agar aap mere raaj mei jee rhe hain, toh raajtantra aapka hai :-P. Milte rhenge bhai mei toh kabhi phone karlunga tu bhi bilkul mat sochiyo!
All the best bhai for your new chapter! I hope that I'll play a role that I had been in your campus life  as in your life ahead in the aura called ""Suyash Singh"".

Bahut mazze aaye the bhai Bangalore trip mei, har weekend hi trip ho rhi thi, we even celebrated your birthday there too!  Vo train se vaapas aana aur jaana aur uske beech ki conversations, summing up your semester, random rants aur arbitary discussions, kaafi sahi rhete the! It feels good poore 4 years hum log touch mei the, when only things just started out of coincidence, I am glad that happened. Chalo milte hain bhai jald hi party karenge mast. All the best!

TA ke project mei group alag se banawaya phir bhi, kya hi bana diya tha end mei lol :-P. Your goals are really refined and work really hard for that and that's something I learnt from.
