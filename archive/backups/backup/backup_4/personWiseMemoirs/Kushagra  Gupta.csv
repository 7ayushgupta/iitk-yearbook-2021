0,"I remember the first walk I had in IITK, it was with you, figuring out the way to the airstrip. Tabhi se feel aa gayi thi ki bohot genuine banda hai, and this is the kind of people I want to meet here. It's been a long journey since, one that I've had the privilege to share with you. We've shared goals, dreams and ambitions, but the thing I'll remember the most is being able to share the truth with you. You may not think of it as much, but genuinely bohot kam log milte hai jinnke sath you can actually be yourself. I believe in you bhai, you just need to build the same confidence in you about yourself. Math ka RR to hum dono hi bhoolna chahte hai, so I won't recollect that here. What I want to cherish is our shared aspirations, our countless efforts chasing it and our shared dreams which we're going to achieve sooner rather than later.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a3df56819323d199d47fb8,Aakash  Khandelwal
1,"Bhai! Can't even begin, or hope to capture the moments I've shared with you, yearbook mei itni capacity hi nahi hai. College ki pehli daru se leke akhri tak (I made it a point not to drink after you left), canteen ke kebab parantha se leke Goa ke kaju tak, first year ke kattapa se leke...kattapa to tu abhi bhi hai XD, college ke some of the best experiences I've had the privilege of living with you. I'm terribly poor at first impressions, but thank god I was right about you, you bright bundle of positive energy. Even though NN was making us laugh, you've been the one to make me smile. In some of my darkest times in IITK, teri koi faltu bakchodi ya impossible plan was enough to remind me what's good in life, a random visit to your room was enough to remind me ki jitna bhi haggu I'll always have the best place to return to. Honestly, you've been the glue to our group, wo fevicol ka jod jo dosti jodta chala gaya. If I use the IITK lingo of bhai in it's truest sense, you shine as the best example of it. If ever you need me, if ever you make a plan, count me in, cause it's not about the place, it's about the people ( ;) ). This is not goodbye!

2,"Smartest person on campus, hands down (I include the profs too XD)! With that out of the way, thanks for all the memories and support man! I really appreciate it. I can't think of any other person to share the coordiship of Pclub with, and if it wasn't for times when we had to just grind thorugh it, the club would've failed. You've been the best coordinator the club has seen, atleast in my eyes (and that's a big compliment given the history). But you go way beyond that, I've always been in awe whenever I've worked with you, be it competing in Inter IIT, discussing topics people will understand only after 150 years, working through making problems or lectures, designing a Tshirt or even simply playing board games. I've always felt a certain ease when hanging out with you, and maybe that's why it was special for me. I'll cherish our talks cycling to and fro to RM, movie screening and board games in astro club, our discussions (literally everywhere), our 'trip' to Bombay, shared lunches and dinners (pizzas have never tasted the same outside Sandy's room) and most importantly, everything I've learnt from you.

3,"Bsdk! Sorry, couldn't start your memoir without this. Let me start this memoir with an apology you deserve, tu humara personal punching bag tha but you stood strong through all of it. Can't think of a more fun or interesting person I've ever met, or imagine college life being what is was without you! And honestly speaking, you're one of the few people I cherish the most meeting here, so definitely US to leke jaa raha hu tujhe bhale hi bag mei bharke leke jana pade...can't imagine life being fun without you being in it. We all know tu bohot hi zyada smart hai, but what I want to talk about is how supportive and good-hearted you've been. Thode matlabi to sab hote hai XD, but the effort I've seen you putting for others (man it goes way beyond giving coding tests for others) is astonishing. Although life ki practicality mei kafi hagga hai tune (kabhi bag cinema hall mei bhoolna, kabhi phone, and wallet and ID card to bhagwan jane kaha hai)...but the way you've conducted your four years here, from your ideology towards it to your logic for living it, are closest to perfection. Your strength of character is astounding, jitne mazze humne tere liye I can't think of anyone else who could have faced it with a smile, and still be the buzzing, brilliant happy-feet. Know this for a fact mate that jitna devotion and dedication tune apni friendship mei dikhaya hai for all of us, utna hi hum bhi reciprocate karte hai tere liye. 'Aap -aap' karte hue 4 saal to nikal hi liye tune, ab Google bhi jaa raha hai..you're well on track on your plan to be the next CEO xd. Even after all our first year debates, fight club brawls and fifa el clasico's, you're the first person I would stand up for on campus. Although first year mei humne tujhe duniyadari sikhane ka try kiya ho, I will say this..never change.

4,"Maybe we didn't start on the right foot (absolutely no idea why that's the case), but I'm so glad we corrected it (bonding over maal ka perfect example!). You're one of the most fun people to have a conversation with and a really cool person to hang out with (even the sober me agrees). We've shared loads of stuff, from our branch, halls, debates and Vox to bongs, our love for beef, hijacking trains, sutte and drunkard dance steps. Convocation in Goa was extremely fun minister! And I'm thrilled to have had you as my Hobbes. It sometimes feels like you're one of the most wrongly judged people in hall 2, but I feel like I know you much better now, having shared a convocation at Goa and a very tipsy return to college.

5,"King of all trades man! IITK ka sabse talented banda hands down! I only really met you in 2021, but the fact that I've come to appreciate so much about you in such a short time speaks tons about your sheer brilliance. Masterchef Goa, Kanpur ka Da Vinci, Senna of SAE and a really sweet person. Thank you for introducing me to F1 mate. I'll forever cherish our memories in Goa..Hemant ki shadi, hijacking trains, almost being arrested, swimming with the fishes, living dangerously on Goa roads, impossible dark room games, perfect snacks and coffee, the best rum after a long trek..the list is endless. You inspire me to be a better person man, I've learnt a lot from you.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a6eb88819323d199d491d9,Akshay
6,"Mr Debater! It's been a pleasure debating with you and just hanging out with you on our pilgrimages to Mocha and Chick Blast. I'll never forget our beginning in Antaragni, but what followed was more than memorable.

7,"Pranam prabhu! Aapki aarti likhte likhte memoir pe aa gaye hai. From literally seeking your blessings before exams in the first sem to the final hug before leaving IITK, you've been an integral part of my stay at IITK. You are the person I respect the most in IITK, and it never fails to amaze me how you always know the right thing to do, whatever the situation might be. I honestly wouldn't have believed that a perfect blend of understanding, smartness, kindness, courage, fun, wit, creativity, charm, humour, insight, personability, confidence, empathy, adventure (running out of adjectives here) could have existed, but you proved me wrong. From our first interaction on the mess table in the first sem to goodbyes of the last month, I knew I was talking to someone special. You've always been the strength of the group (including fight club XD) while also being the most comforting presence with an easy and charming laugh.  We have often shared moments of understanding, where a slight of the eye or a mid-sentence pause or a passing reference communicated what words could not, and the fact you could do this with anyone is a one in billion quality (and so are you!). I'll admit it, I was a little envious of you initially, but that quickly changed into awe, love and respect. You've been a constant inspiration for me, and I owe a lot of my transformation at IITK to learning from you. After all, who better to model yourself from than a guy who's seemingly perfect at everything. Your friendship means a lot to me, and one of the few times I've felt the freedom to be my genuine self have been while talking to you. Thank you for listening to me and accepting me during those times, I hope I can someday explain how important those moments have been. Bhoolne ka to sawal hi nahi uthta, I'm never finding anyone like you anywhere I may travel. All the best for your future mate, know that someone will always be in your corner whatever the situation (I've learnt this from the best ;) ).",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60bfdfe6659165b3aa645149,Anany  Sharma
8,"Hello the-person-I-regret-not-interacting-more-with XD. I'll take this memoir to express my appreciation and gratitude, something which I may never have done but something you definitely deserve. You're one of the most good-hearted, understanding, caring, and hardworking people I've had the privilege to meet. Even though we never got to have night out walks or heart-to-heart conversations, I've always found your presence to be comforting, and I've always felt like I can talk to you about anything. I guess you can call it friendship at first sight XD. Our memories go far and scattered across four years, but what I'll remember you is watching you being the best person in IITK. I'll remember walking into Abhishek's room and finding you consoling him, or meeting you outside CCD being a great friend to Ankit, or always being there for Hemant, and these are the moments that have defined you for me. You inspire me with your dedication to go that extra mile for things you care about, be it your friends or CWC or simply your point of view. You've always been supportive of me, and encouragement from you is extra sweet because I know it's coming from an amazing person. If it were up to meet and the rules permitted, I'd nominate you for every Gymkhana award there is.  We still have time before we get busy with life outside IITK, we'll do everything we missed on our next trip. 

P.S. - I hope the shirt reminds you of our friendship.

It's been awesome being one of the six rational people in debate rooms with you, watching your incredible journey to become one of the best we have to offer (also, beating Arnav in NUJS was oh so satisfying). You had some great ideas for the club, and I would've loved to see them become a reality. You've had a roller coaster of a journey at IITK, and I'm glad to have shared some of its highs (quite literal highs, bhand Ojha iz da best [1][2][3][4]). But despite all your antics, the dedicated and diligent Ojha is a force to be reckoned with. I've been a huge fan of your 'that's what your mommy said' moments, and your wise-ass one-liners crack me up every time. Keep to your brilliant best man, I am waiting for you to figure out where you want to make your mark cause you're just too talented not to make it big.

I'll remember you for the late-night winter camp sessions (and yashsriv giving me your messenger nickname), NYO discussions on turtle porn, pizza parties on a train to Mumbai, getting robbed of shrimps by IITB fachhas, collecting chillar while singing in antaragni, anti bong movement in German classes, the one debate I was able to drag you to, riding the highs and lows of a difficult coordinatorship, and the 'very formal' tea parties. Although we drifted apart towards the end of our journey (primarily because of my stupidity), I'm glad we got to share so many experiences, and I hope to make new ones when we meet in the US.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c08fed659165b3aa6451b1,Anish  Saxena

We took longer than I expected to become friends (thanks to our awesome start), but I'm glad we finished with sharing joints (NOT the joints you put on cakes) rather than sharing scars. I've only recently come to discover how wonderful a person you are, and I'm happy for the times we got to spend together in 2021. Our walk in Goa wasn't exactly how I thought it would be, but I guess that goes for our friendship too. We've come a long way, from ignoring each other in chem lab to trying to extend our shared stay in Goa (thankfully not with the police). I don't care what anyone thinks, but I got the best gift in secret Santa because has the force with her my Santa. Cheers to our shared highs -- from moping the OAT stage on Holi to practically drowning in Mama-Mio shakes to almost breaking the first floor with our killer dance moves in Goa. We're like gin and tonic, only recently discovering how fun we are when mixed. Let our friendship age, iska nasha bhi dheere chadega. ",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60b741f4659165b3aa644f54,Anshika  Verma

Listening to you talk about Deep Dream motivated me to make a dream of my own. I knew that you were brilliant from the winter-camp (first sem se to chaap hi raha hai, your gradient ascent learning rate is not a number), and I only expected that you would ace it in the end. Discussing ML related stuff (yeah, most of it was one way with you pouring knowledge) was super fun, and left me wanting to work more after I could close my mouth from awe. But despite being one of the most chapu people I've ever met, thanks for always being available for help (CS 698 plag reacts only). Your stellar career is well matched by your humble self. We'll watch you climb to the top of your field, but please don't forget us minions at the summit(just kidding, you're too good of a person to do so).

Definitely one of the most fun people I've met, teri harkato se Medha ki chandangoh bhi sharma jaye.

I remember thinking how tf is this guy so organized with his thoughts, aren't we both adjudicating for the first time! But that was you, all calm and collected and that's how I'll remember you. Discussing anything and everything with you has been an awesome experience. Through these discussions, I've learned a lot from you, learnings going beyond simple arguments to a way of organizing my thoughts. From a novice whip to a master, it's been a pleasure sharing the debating stage with you, NUJS and beyond was a lot of fun. Thanks for starring in our win over Arnav and for coming to the debate at Hindu. Our frequent pilgrimages to Mocha (and even the virtual one) were special, and they helped me know you as a friend along with a debater. The poster boy of Debsoc, dog lover like no other, a masterful debater, someone quick to smile and a friend in need. Keep in touch, I'm looking forward to future discussions.

Spending time in RM and astro club with you and Gulati had a lasting, serene quality to it because it just felt inexplicably right. No social pressures, annoying obligations, or a need to constantly filter what I'm saying..I was in my natural habitat when you both were around. Maybe that's why we had so much fun in simple things like cycling around the campus, screening movies in astro club, lounging in RM, sharing meals in Chick Blast (or in Sandy's room lol) or the not so simple (and extremely fun) 'trip' to IIT Bombay for inter IIT XD. BTW I didn't know you were a snack monster! RM third floor Bakarwadi, chowpati snacks on the beaches of Bombay, endless deliveries from zomato itna jata kaha hai? Maybe that super brain of yours requires constant fuel. US-Canada boundary kood ke visit karna, we'll always have a Disneyland ticket for you.

It's weird because maybe it's an effect of reading Sanderson, but you're radiant with the light of Bridge 4 :). You're great at friendship, you know that? It's because you go way beyond the regular tickboxes of being a friend, and I feel like I can always rely on you. You bring a certain uniqueness (for lack of a better word) to any group, a breath of fresh air essential to complete any group. From being a frivolous bundle of energy lighting up faces to a thinker in deep thought, I've seen you be it all. I sincerely appreciate you confiding in me on our Goa trip, and am honoured to have you reward me with your trust.

I know it's a big thing to ask, your journey has been incredibly tough, and you've had to fight through a lot. But I know that you are incredibly strong and will pull through whatever is thrown at you, so why not do it with a smile and prove everyone who doubts you wrong? I'm just talking about the smile though, you still need to work on your awkward leg poses XD. Riding through Goa has been amazing with you. Apologies for the last bumpy ride, but I'll make up for it with that white dress you spotted on the way to Morjim. It was amazing hijacking the aero farewell with you (sadly, it's the only one we could go to), but hey, convocation in Goa was amazing too. Congrats on finishing the Doodh Sagar trek first! Tees Maar Khan ke jungly kisse motivated you a lot apparently. Talking to you has always been fun, even if it's bitching about SNT or random RR. You have an extremely comforting presence, and it's so easy to laugh when you're around. Thank you for lighting up my days whenever I've met you. I hope I'm still on your good people list.

IITK places us close because of our roll numbers, and fortunately, that worked out to be incredibly fun in orientation and beyond!

Maybe that's because they are always coming from the right place, or maybe because you are unabashed and pure of heart or maybe because we connect on some different level that we are yet to understand. Even though you haven't been with us from the start, you've undoubtedly become an indispensable part of our group, someone who completes us. One of the most dedicated and hardworking members of our batch, surely one of the best we have to offer. And this is not restricted to your work, where we know you're incredible, but extends to your friendships as well. Remember that day in our third year, jab Ram room mei akela baitha hua tha and we both were trying to get him to tell us the problem, or that party in Abhishek's room jab Srinivas mil nahi raha tha, or that night in antaragni where we left hall 6 together. In moments like these, I realised how lucky I am to have a friend like you—an absolut(e) gin(em). Although we share countless memories of cycling trips, Delhi parties, aero farewells, group chats, baby yoda tales, beer exchanges, politics (of both kinds), crazy final month parties (and hangovers) that I cherish, I can't seem to have enough of them.

I miss walking around the campus with you in our first year. The random treats, blue world plans and nightouts were extra special because you were there.

Thanks for supporting my gadda khodne wala idea in Martin Garrix's concert, I still owe you a treat for that (although that extra charge for the semi spending the night was so not worth it). There's a reason your friends love you a lot, and that's because you are a bundle of pure ecstasy (not the emotion, the drug).

Lol I'd even say I was able to party freely because I knew agar kuch bhi hua to Ram bhaiya to sambhal hi lenge (except that day in Goa, beach pe chhut hi gaya tha tu XD). And the number of times you've offered to help on your own, somehow magically sensing when I needed help but was too ashamed or too beaten down to ask for it, is something I can never thank you enough for. Know that I have always appreciated your help and kindness, and it was only a lack of words that inhibited me from expressing my gratitude. Mishra jaisa matlabi admi tak bolta hai ki Ram sabse pehle aage ayenge madad karne, and Khandu ne Hyderabad ke kisse to sunaye hi hai. But obviously, you go way beyond that. You've been a constant rock in the sometimes spiralling experiences of IITK. Not kidding, just looking at your neatly organized side of the room used to give me a sense of stability XD. And thanks for being patient and bearing the annoyance that I am, honeslty koi bhi aur to kabka laat marke nikal chuka hota. And thanks for being the eyes and ears of our group, you've made our experiences and memories immortal. IITK photos dekhke sabse pehle teri yaad hi ayegi. We have so many memories to share, from small tid bits as roommates to party freaks in Goa to passengers on the same track. I can't capture all of this within a few sentences, but you've already done that for us. Your trove of photos and videos is the most precious treasure for me in IITK, and a constant reminder of the special people like yourself that I had the privilege of meeting. Jaate jaate Abhishek ke baap ki upadhi dena chahtu hu, solving one of the biggest confusions of our times and a promise to try to emulate all you've done for me in IITK (a task which I can never possibly complete but would gladly attempt nonetheless).",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60bfcf99659165b3aa64513a,Ram  Goyal
27,"Few have an aura of positivity, who deserve a halo around their heads. Little did I know they would also be extremely fun to party with. I've tried to become a better person through my four years here, and I want to thank you for being one of my role models for this. I can't think of anyone more deserving the respect that you command over everyone. Ritesh badhiya aadmi hai, yeh sab hi bolte hai (aadhi bottle vodka andar ho ya bahar). It's a big feat that this respect comes primarily out of love, given all your blinding achievements. I've seen many people who pretend to be good, but none so kind and caring even when there's no spotlight to recognize everything they've done. But people do remember your kindness, and so do I, and maybe that's why they remember you as one of their closest friends. You might not remember it, but we met for the first time on the Bollywood night of our first year antaragni. We didn't know each other's name then, but something drew me towards you as I had the most fun swaying and dancing to the music. We've made loads of memories since, from jumping on bollywood songs to spraying passes on football fields, to sharing intern rejections from companies that do not deserve us, to countless parties in the final month. Even though Mishra and Gunjan are great friends of mine, your selection in Google was the most special, simply because you are one of the best IITK has to offer. 
P.S. - I still enjoy the song you recommended me once on messenger, not because I've suddenly become fond of Hindi songs, but rather because it reminds me of the times we've shared.
P.P.S - Trip to pakka banti hai, Jindal ko peeth pe baithake bhagte hue wapas dekhna hai mujhe.

28,"Hey man! Medha might be annoyed if she reads this, but your iPad notes were the best (by a big margin :P). Thanks for all your help, especially when I couldn't understand my own handwriting XD. They have literally convinced me to but an iPad for myself. That summer studying econometrics was fun man, especially the 'hijacking' we did on *someone's* account. Although we haven't hung out a lot, the stories I've heard about you from people are enough to convince me that you are an incredible person. I'm a huge fan of your design work man, keep the good stuff coming.
P.S. I'm still coming back to you for all phone-related questions, even fifty years from now!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c232bc659165b3aa645b05,Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai
29,"Yo LKT! Remember, daddy is always proud (insert image) XD. Bhai balti to bharni padegi, mai to bol raha hu upgrade karke bathtub kar dete hai. We just missed getting you in hall 2, but you've always been one of us. Maybe that's because you always brought a smile to our faces. Hoodie lace fight ki championship karenge! But iss baar apne glasses sambhal ke rakhiyo (sry for that XD). We've all found our niche in the conglomerate of IITK, but my journey wouldn't have been as much fun if you weren't a part of it. When I look back at my best memories of first year, I realise that they were extra special because of you. Thank you for being that dependable, genuine, good vibes, killer dancer (I remember the dance face-offs in first year XD) friend that brightens up any group. In the memory of all the good times, scarring Baldips since 2018!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60b73706659165b3aa644f53,Soumya  Gupta
30,"Taare zameen par XD... IITK ka sabse 'special' bachha hai tu, and sabse fun bhi. People will remember you for all the times you've made them laugh, teri bakchodi world famous hai. But I'm glad to be one of the fortunate few to have witnessed your other side too. I remember my first late-night walk on campus, hum football field ke peeche chal rahe the and tab teri processing fast thi XD. You struck me as a highly sensible guy, but wo tere baap wing mei 2 kele dabane tak hi seemit tha. Just kidding, I've found that same Swapnil whenever I talk to you (even the conversation in Delhi just before coming to campus). Thanks for taking care of Yoda, you were like a parent to her, and she wouldn't have survived if not for you. Jitna bhi tu usse maar le I know tujhe wo bohot zyada pasand thi kyunki aise hi subah 4 baje uthke kisi random kutte ka dhyan nahi rakhta koi. Jitne mazze tune dilaye hai, uske aadha bhi koi kare to they'll say they had the best campus life..so thanks a lot for being the ever entertainer, college life wouldn't have been close to special without you in it. Jitni jaan fight club mei lagai hai, utni hi har jagah lagade koi rok nahi payega tujhe. There's a reason you have a special place in all our hearts, sath ki bakchodiya to theek hai but dil bohot saaf hai tera. I have always found a companion in you whenever I needed one, I hope I can be the same for you. Iss memoir me memories to nahi daal paya mai, aakhir hai hi itni sari and itni special that the only place where they can do justice is my heart. So let this be a memoir of gratitude, a token in front of everything you've done for me and for others. ",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60bbccb6659165b3aa644feb,Swapnil  Tripathi
31,"Yo! You're only human and not a robot, right? Sometimes your addiction, conviction and almost perversion for perfection is beyond comprehension XD. Haan bhai, yaha log tere level ke hi nahi hai XD, because you operate on a super-human level. I don't understand exactly how, but I know that you'll kill it at Tower while nailing your various start-ups at the same time. Well, maybe because it's you we're talking about. Goa trip was super fun mate, even though you were sober the entire time! Your chapuness aside (although I'd like to see anyone try to move the bulk of it), you are one of the sweetest people on campus. I remember our first interaction, we met in that CS food fest thingy and were cycling back to our halls. You noticed something wrong with my cycle, and immediately jumped off to fix it, and I thought, yeah, he's a nice guy :). Keep up your excellent work ethic and ambition man! Baki Baba ka ashirvad to hai hi apke yoga lessons ki wajah se. Can't wait to meet you again in the US, please invite me to your rooftop pool full of money.

P.S. Thanks a ton for the card, it brightened up my day.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c22feb659165b3aa645aa9,Yash  Baheti
