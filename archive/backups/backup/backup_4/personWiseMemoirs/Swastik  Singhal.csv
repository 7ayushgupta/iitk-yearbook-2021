Its been a while since we hung out. I still remember how you, Ananya and Avisha helped me during the worst time of my life. We became best friends instantly in the first semester and now when I look back I feel so lucky to have you as a friend. Fests were so amazing with you guys and I hope you still remember my signature step :P
Its sad that we drifted apart after the first sem but I had some reasons. But looking back now, none of those reasons were good enough to lose an amazing friend like you. I hope we catch up again in future and hang out whenever we have a chance.",Swastik  Singhal,True,60bd1ddf659165b3aa645038,Dishaa  Rajora
1,Maine kuch nahi kiya tha.. Tu khud hi itni baatein karti rehti thi ki deregister toh hona hi tha.. :P,Swastik  Singhal,False,60bd1ad9659165b3aa645037,Jaya  Maheswari
2,"Khichar sir chaapu wale sir.. Apni wing ka superstar hai tu bhai.
Bhai tere saath canteen jaane ke alag hi maze the.. saala kaam karte se utha kar le jata tha. Tere se zyada chill aur mast banda nahi mila.. Pure sem nahi padhte the but fir bhi exam mein chaap dete the.. Agar campus mein kisi ko pubg khelne ka award milna chaiye toh woh tu aur tera judwa bhai hain :P Kya hi alag level ke pro players ho bhai (Emulator par :P).
Tere ko zabardasti MT le jaane mein jo maza tha woh MT jaane mein nahi tha.. Gudgudi karte hue le jao :P
Aur bhai yeh last sem ki bakchodi toh alag level thi.. Tere room ki toh gaand hi maar li thi.. sab wahi baithe milte the. Tagda mahaul banta tha.. 
Tu life mein aage kaafi machaega aur agar possible hua toh pakka saath mein startup zarur kholenge.. ",Swastik  Singhal,True,60bd1a5f659165b3aa645036,Rahul Kumar Khichar
3,"Bro kaha se shuru karu samajh nahi aata. 4 saal ki dosti ek memoir mein toh nahi likhi ja sakti but i'll try.
We met in the library and I thought you were some random Y17 guy with a common friend but kisne socha tha ki apan best friends ban jaenge.. Tu un logo mein se hai jinse mai kuch bhi share kar sakta hu and tu judge bhi nahi karta.
Tere saath chai dates and trips to banarsi tea stall are so memorable to me. Hall 4 mein raat ko sirf chai ke liye milte the and dil ki saari baatien khol dete the. Those were the best of times.
Apni mussorie trip toh bhai bakchod thi and tu mujhe agli trip se pehle swimming sikha diyo please!! :PP
You are one of the best persons I met on campus. You were a true friend to me and always tried to correct me when I was wrong. You stood with me always when i was low and always celebrated with me in my highs. Tu hamesha mujhe encourage karta hai aage bhadne ke liye and that is a very rare thing on campus tbh. I really miss you man.
I will always be there for you whenever you need me.
Call me when you want, call me when you need, call me in the morning and I'll DEFINITELY be on my way.
Tu mera dost nahi, bhai hai bhai. Love you brother. ",Swastik  Singhal,True,60bd1757659165b3aa645035,Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai
