You are one of the sweetest and most humble people I know. I am glad that in whatever time we got, we became good friends with each other. The CTM selection period, orientation sessions, Hakuna Matata, all were fun and awesome when you were there. Coordies ko mana kar treat lene ka bhi apna hi maza that yaar us time. It would have been great agar hume thoda aur time mila hota interact karne ka. 

All the best for your journey. Humehsa aisi hi sweet, kind, humble and helping person rehna yaar. I really cherish you for that. Hum bahut jald milenge wapas. Tab tak ke liye take care and please stay in touch <3<3<3",Tanishq  Patil,True,60c201ab659165b3aa64578d,Abha  Tamrakar

Apna main interaction bhi PUBG ne hi shuru karwaya tha yaar. Uske baad fir MSO201 aaya, apni sabki achche se baja kar gaya wo course. Still yaad hai uska wo objective endsem, negative marking ke karan sab roye the marks aane ke baad xD

Nonetheless, a special mention goes to our last stay in campus, mene kaafi bond kiya tere saath. Thank you yaar for all that advice in Samu's room during quarantine and afterwards as well. Wo advices kaafi help kar gayi. Those among us nights, endless bullas, carrying out the rescue operations after people getting stoned, sab ke sab kaafi mazedaar the :P. Us stay mein I got to know your other side as well ki kitna emotional bhi hai tu, bas duniya ko khulke dikhata nahi. Really glad that we bonded. And aage Bangalore to hai hi apne saath.

Situation normal hote hi wapas se trip plan karte hain, tere saath ek bhi trip nahi ho paayi meri. Aur aage Bangalore mein aur bhi jyada enjoy karenge, plans ready rakhna :P

Until next time then, dhyaan rakhna apna, touch mein to rahenge hi apan, explicitly nahi bolunga :P. Milte hain wapas se bahut jald.

PS: Thank you for convincing me for Hall Photoshoot, warna mein definitely regret karta baad mein.

Jab bhi koi mujhse puchega ki name the most all-round person you know, undoubtedly tera naam hi sabse pehle aayega mere dimaag mein. Kaise chaap leta hai yaar har jagah itna. Spill the secret please :P

Beginning your IITK journey from a chubby moustache guy (:P) and evolving towards a smarter, wittier and one of the fittest guys in the wing, we all have had our moments together. You are one of the most mature persons I have ever met, and your dedication and hardworking has always been on a different level. I firmly believe ki tu bahut aage jaayega life mein and will do something big <3

I can’t thank you enough for all the calls and texts you did to me when I needed them the most. You provided me support I can rely on when I was searching for one. Humesha aise hi kind-hearted and happiness spreading insaan rehna. This world needs a lot more people like you :P

If I start counting the times jab humne saath mein kaafi maze kiye, list finite nahi reh paayegi xD. Still,

To all the football and volleyball matches

To kahan se shuru karun, saare kisse likhne baith gaya to words aur space dono kam padd jaayegi xD

Okay, so let's start from the summer of 2019. Spending the entire day in the office without doing anything significant, getting stuck in never-ending bulla sessions, waking up at 1 PM on weekends in the office, and whatnot. I can't remember even the smallest duration of that summer, which was not fun with you being there <3

Dil se thank you yaar for all the support you provided me. I remember ranting in front of you, getting all disappointed and ready to give up after I got rejected by those companies I had prepared and worked hard for. You lifted me up in those times and kept my strength intact. And you kept doing the same countless other times as well, including the frustrating second week of my internship :P

Arzoo, you're the strongest person I know. In this last one and a half year, you have seen a lot of ups and downs, but you were always there, always available if anyone needed your help or your presence. The way you keep your cool in difficult situations and then give your best to come out of them, I really envy you for that. You have worked very hard to reach where you are today, and you truly deserve it <3

Understanding you would have been the most difficult thing I have ever done. And I can proudly say that I did succeed to some extent in this regard :P. I am very grateful that we became such good friends. Tu bahut down to earth person hai yaar, and you were always there to listen to me without judging, whenever I needed you. Also, I won't ever forget the humorous responses you used to provide even in serious situations because, surprisingly, they did cheer me up a lot of times :P. Everyone knows your sassy and badass side, and it has been mentioned in your other memoirs as well, but here I am with the totally different aspect of Arzoo jo shayad jyada logon ne perceive nahi kiya hoga :P

All the best for all your future endeavours. Always stay the kind, bold, and fearless person you originally are and have a great life ahead. Be happy humesha and keep spreading the smiles around you. Numerous bets were won and lost, and a lot of debt is yet to be paid. Isliye jaldi hi milenge saara hisaab chukane ke liye. Cheers to all the bad times and, more importantly, the fun and the good times we spent beside each other <3

Until next time. Take care and lots of love, best friend <3<3<3",Tanishq  Patil,True,60c1d672659165b3aa645591,Arzoo

Okay, here we are now!! Ending one phase of our companionship before commencing another one. And here I am with my words (although these would never be sufficient) describing our friendship.

Itne sweet, humble, cheerful aur wholesome insaan kaise ho yaar tum, mujhe bhi sikha do thoda please so that I might come out as less formal and less straight-forward with the people I meet for the first time.

मैं अकेला ही चला था जानिब-ए-मंज़िल मगर 
लोग साथ आते गए और कारवाँ बनता गया

Is karwaan ka sabse pehla kafir tu hi hai bro. I still remember the day I texted you and you called me back to hear me rant out. You are the person who taught me the importance of self-care, and I will forever be grateful to you for that. You had to bear a lot of shitty arguments of mine, pata nahi sorry bolun ya thank you. Better leave it to you, jo better lage wo rakh lena, jo na lage wo bhi rakh hi lena :P. Those evening walks and philosophical (and maybe moral and ethical) discussions with you and Dipuk in our last stay are the ones that I will always cherish and remember.

If I remember our first interaction, it was probably on the day we became CTMs. You were an introverted, calm, sweet, humble and this awesome guy when we first met. Over the span of two years, I have seen you evolve, and the best thing about you is that you kept all of your good aspects intact within you, you didn’t change even a bit in that regard. 

Summer of 2019 kitna mast tha na yaar, we used to just sit around and gossip in the office the whole day. I wish we got more time to be in each other’s proximity in our Coordie tenure as well. All those long meetings, interviews, sessions, might have been frustrating at that time but are now a happy nostalgia. Also, please maaf kar dena jab bhi mene tujhe kuch bol diya ho kaam ke pressure mein aake, you know that ki mene mean karke to bilkul nahi bola hoga. And agar nahi karna hai maaf to bhi koi na, next time milunga tab aur achche se gaaliya dunga xD

I know mein Goa trip par nahi aa paaya tha, bas uski bharpaayi hogi, barabar hogi. Situation normal hote hi worcation plan karte hain. And planning ki responsibility meri :P

Kitna bhi likh dun, wo kam hi hoga tujhe and humari journey ko describe karne ke liye. Isliye aur trivial baatein naa likh kar end kar deta hun. Baaki to tujhe pata hi hai dil se kitni gaaliyan (ya maybe blessings ;) ) deta tujhe.

All the best to bolunga hi, ritual jo hai, so All the best for all your future endeavours. Bahur jald wapas milenge and aur bhi jyada enjoy karenge. Waise bhi tu kahan hi jaa raha hai, apna to Oracle se lekar Bangalore tak ka saath hai. A lot more years filled with fun are yet to come. Stay in touch nahi bolunga kyunki wo to tu rahega hi, and agar contact chhuta to fir to you know me, ki mein kya karunga tere saath :P

Coding ka to tu chaapu hai hi, GSoC karli second year mein, fir samsung mein intern, ab Zomato mein job. Kitna kamaya hai saale tune pichle do saalon mein, par treat na di ek bhi. Koi na, pending rahi, next time milenge tab lunga hi saale tujhse treat. Trip plan karte hain jaldi hi, aa hi jana, campus wale har din ki tarah rr mat karna is baar. Milte hain jaldi wapas, enjoy karenge sab saath mil kar. Tab tak take care and stay in touch.

Sherlock ki ringtone ka idea dene ke liye shukriya, 3.5 saal tak wahi thi mere phone mein, all thanks to you :P 
TA202, BSE656, and CGS601 mein kaafi maza aaya yaar tere saath, kuch na kuch fun and interesting hota hi rehta tha (waise BSE656 mein to tu bada khush hua hoga, I know :P)
Also, HR ka idea bura nahi, try kar sakte future mein :P

And All the best for your journey. I believe ki tu bahut aage jaayega, bharosa hai tujh par kaafi. Zomato ke coupons bhejte rehna yaar, Bangalore mein udata rahunga mein :P

I remember we started playing PUBG together in the 3rd semester. Kaafi mazedaar waqt tha yaar wo.

And how can I forget these last 50 days of our stay on campus yaar. Quarantine would have been very boring without you. That video shoot we did on the OAT roof, playing poker in your room, OAT photoshoot, getting evicted, nearly escaping SSAC, and then Samu ke room mein baith kar sabka tension se much utar jaana, bahut kisse hain yaar raise, jitne ginaun utne kam hain. Dominos se kaafi pizzas order kiye humne saath mein, and Verma ke room mein baithkar matches bhi dekhe kaafi. Kaafi enjot kiya yaar mene teri company mein.

Bahut humble insaan hai yaar tu. Always stay the same. All the best for your journey and hopefully jaldi hi trip plan karke sab milte hain wapas se. Tab take take care and stay in touch!",Tanishq  Patil,True,60c1ffaf659165b3aa64576e,Sohail  Ansari

Working with you in various lab courses was amazing yaar. You always brought brilliant ideas to the table. Humne shayad TA201, TA202 and ESO203 lab ki thi saath mein. Hopefully future mein milna hoga hi humara. I believe you will do great things in your life. All the best for your journey. ",Tanishq  Patil,False,60c1f67e659165b3aa6456f4,Vakul  Bansal

Aaj bhi yaad hai wo din jab tu Antaragni mein Poker competetion jeet kar aaya tha and mene tera number apne phone mein 'Juari' naam se save kiya, and it is still the same xD

Tu wing ka sabse happening and energetic insaan hai yaar. Tere loop mein gaane chalte the and wo sunkar mein bhi search karke wo sunna start kar deta tha xD. Thank you for all the wifi your D-Link provided us in the F-Block. Also, thank you for all the free snacks jo tu khushi khushi baant deta tha.

IITK ki is last visit mein tere bina maza nahi aata yaar. Wo party arrange karwane ke liye shukriya, kaafi maza aaya the usme. It has always been fun to have you around. Baaki aise hi regular rehna aur mehnat karte rehna, placements mein chaap dega tu, mujhe bharosa hai.

Apni temporarily cancelled trip of Ladakh plan karte hain yaar jaldi hi. Tere saath trip par jaana hai yaar, abhi tak mauka hi nahi mila. Tab tak take care, stay safe and stay in touch!! Aag lagayenge next trip par!!",Tanishq  Patil,True,60c1fb87659165b3aa645731,Vikram  Singh
32,"Hiiii Yashikaaaa!!!!

Will start by thanking you for the card you gave me that day. It was one of the sweetest and most wholesome things anyone has ever done for me. The message you wrote inside was very heart-warming. You almost had me in tears that evening. It meant a lot. Thank you again <3<3

I didn’t get to know you much initially but roaming around in Antaragni with you was veryyy fun. All that mocking and daring we five used to do around, I will always remember it. That was the time when we started bonding. 

Working beside you as a CS Coordinator was pure bliss for me. This tenure definitely made us better friends and improved our bond. It was my pleasure (and honour as well :P) working with you as your fellow Coordie. I wish we could have gotten more time to work with each other on the campus itself.

You are one of the most sincere, kind, and wholesome people I know. Always stay the same, a lot of people (including me :) ) cherish you for that <3. We will soon meet again. I will be in Bengaluru, and I might drop off to Mangalore and ask you for a tour, so please be prepared for that :P. Also, our Coordie trip is pending, so let’s plan it as soon as the situation returns to normalcy.

All the very best for your journey!! Take care and lots of love <3<3<3",Tanishq  Patil,True,60c10dda659165b3aa64531b,Yashika
