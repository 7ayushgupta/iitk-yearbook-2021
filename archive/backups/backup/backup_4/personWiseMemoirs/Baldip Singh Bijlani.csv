The next three years were filled with many such instances of me walking to your room and then us roaming the path between our wings. I have always felt better after talking to you. You never failed to cheer me up however bad the situation might have been, however sad you yourself would have been. Never would have survived CSE without you😅

 Thanks for being a great friend. I hope to see you soon. Best of luck",Baldip Singh Bijlani,True,60c13e9f659165b3aa6453cc,Abhishek  Bhatia

4,"Bhai tere mail id mein 2004 kyu aata hai.  Anyways, Sanghi bhai. Tere chakkar mein bahut sidiya chadi hai bhai😅. But worth it for your company. Tu literally mera academic mentor raha hai. Mein chein ki nind sota tha yeh sochke ki assignment to sanghi kara hi dega. 

But sabh se zyada important tune mera perspective badla tha padhai ke baare mein. You had a huge hand in making be process oriented rather than goal oriented making my journey much more enjoyable. (Feel free to construct double meaning about the previous sentence🤣).

5,"Before starting to write memoirs, I made a list of people by how I knew them, clubs, department, social circles, etc. You were on every single one of those lists. 

You have done the fastest 180 I've ever seen. The first time I worked with you on any assignment, we were taking a break in the dosa canteen. You said and I quote ""bhai abhi itna kucch padhna hai, pata hai Fermat's last theorem ka proof 129 pages ka hai, abh nhi padhenge to kabh"" 😅. Exactly one year after that, ""bhai os ka assignment karwaane aajao"", and then leaving saying ""abe jitne ho ske krdena, mein khane ja rha"" and coming back after I submitted it. 

I've always loved your impeccable sense of hunour, timing and an extremely course social filter. I remember you saying to Mainak sir during CS220 endsem paper distribution, while he was writing the course averages, highest, etc. in the most confident voice ever, ""Sir I urge you to write in hexadecimal"", 😂providing much needed comical reprieve to everyone.

 I have enjoyed witty wordplay and weirdly inappropriate yet funny mom jokes many times, even though I have been on the receiving end more often than I would have liked. 😅

I have had a lot of fun, working with you on every group assignment we have done(even if you did not work😋). I enjoyed our after assignment submission parties in UC/Dominos/Hall 1 canteen/Chickblast even more. Loved debating with you on the same team, whenever I got the opportunity to do so. 

You have been with me when I did all stupid stuff for the first time, alcohol, w***, taking VR prematurely😅. 

I am sure that you have given much more back to people at IITK, than you have received. Love you brother. Keep in touch. No excuses, you will be in Gurgaon as well.

 I always wished to emulate your dedication. I remember struggling with a homework in kd at 2 in the morning, feeling frustrated and tired. But you were sitting in the opposite corner, and seeing you made me push on. 

I did not know you liked cricket as well. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have discussed as much academics with you as I did 😅. 

Wish you success in whatever you decide to do. Keep in touch.

15,"Sorry bhai tera memoir likhne mein itni der kardi. I've realised ki tere saath itni memories ki select karna impossible hai. 

Apni banni pehli baar 2nd year mein start hui thi, aur kabhi band nhi hui😅. Tere saath kabhi bhi kaam kro toh maza bahut aata hai kyunki tu hamesha khush aur positive rehta hai. OS ki deadline se pehle aag waali patang udane jaata hai. Parallel ke assignment krte same, Reliance colony aur kota ke kissey sunata hai. Pata hai nhi hoga kuchh, toh bhi bolega tension mat le ho jayega😃. 

Tu had se zyada humble aur self aware hai. Aman ko bolo teri height kam hai to jawab milega, ""😡Almost same to hai"", Tujhe bolo ki bowling thodi dhire hai, jawab milega ""😕Haan yaar spin zyada tez hai"". But trust me, you are very smart and talented, never sell yourself short.
