2,"Hey Arzoo,
I remember one time you surprised me by secretly clicking my picture in the lift. Since then, you have always been surprising me in many ways. I really admire your calm and composure. 'Actions speak louder than words' - It is definitely written for you :P
You make it so easy for people to be comfortable around you. Thanks for always helping me out. 
Keep slaying!",Avisha,True,60c1c7e0659165b3aa645524,Arzoo

 I don’t want to belittle the hardships you have faced but instead compliment the bravado you always had to smile through whatever life threw at you.  Since our first year in PE, I have known you, but I feel like I truly came to know you in the last few months we hung out. You are a trustworthy and reliable friend because god knows I have trusted you with my food several times xD. 
 I am glad we became friends, and you are in one of my most treasured memories of campus.  
 PS: My bottle really misses you! ",Avisha,True,60ab8c03659165b3aa644d8b,Avani  Shrivastava
5,"Hey birthday twin!
I remember we first got to know each other during PE sessions. You kept it very happening either by bunking it or managing to skip the torture in morning sessions xD. 
We haven't hung out much but you always seem to be having fun in life and an entertaining company. Thanks for the hacker girl meme tho :P, really took me by surprise. 
Have fun!",Avisha,True,60bf9887659165b3aa6450f3,Aviral  Khare
6,"Hey, my man!
You were the first person with whom I had any real conversation at IITK. Thanks for being a great friend and bringing me out of the freshers routine numbness back then. I really admire your relaxed attitude and the courage to try out new stuff. Whenever we meet or talk, it seems like we have been talking for a long time. I feel really comfortable with you, and of course, your jokes never fail to crack me up. 
All the best, and keep killing them new hairstyles :P
Okay, bye moo!

7,"Bro, we are going to hang out a lot this coming year. So, I am going to start with the stuff we need to do together, and let me tell you the list is long :P
But before that, have I told you how cool amazing you are?
You have a vibrant presence and charming humor. I absolutely loved your company no matter wherever we met, hostel, canteen or even that crow :P 
Also, next time, we will definitely start the party with lollipop lage lu xD.

8,"If someone asked me to describe you, I would say- ‘She can talk pink, she can walk pink, she can laugh pink, because pink is her favourite colour.’ I am glad our friendship and camaraderie survived through all the blues that IITK threw at us (yes, your memoir is going to be more than just pink, xD). You have been a constant part of the journey since the first semester, and despite our differences, we always managed to make unforgettable memories here. Crazy cycle rides, beer-sneak incident, midnight mosquito reproduction lectures, and rolling at Nicki Minaj’s music videos, to list a few. 
I have great respect for the support and cheer I got from you all these years. In all four years, I have noticed, your confidence is the best colour on you. Never take it off and be unapologetic you always!

I really admire your enthusiasm to take feedbacks and zeal to grow every day. Please give this fan your art and photograph before getting super famous xD.

11,"Hello Mr Candid,
Thenks for profound last-minute advice for you know what back then!
Finally, the time has come for the world to see that 'player' photograph of ours. Damm you got a nice candid there too :P
You have been a lovely person, all the best for your future!",Avisha,True,60c1d03e659165b3aa64555d,Jatin  Rathaur
12,"Let's be honest here. We became friends through Pragya, but she was worried your cancerous humour might spread to me, so she didn't let us hang out much. 
So, with the risk of sounding like your dad again,  I would say keep cracking jokes and have fun with life!  ",Avisha,True,60aeae7e659165b3aa644e45,Mayant  Mukul
13,"Heyy,
You are lovely and helpful. The fresher's music video was so much fun with you around. And man, we all were so dumb back then!
I admired your dedication to athletics and passion for it, which never ran out of fuel. 
Thanks for being a part of my journey, have fun!",Avisha,True,60c24914659165b3aa645e2c,Narendra  Mathuriya
14,"Hey co-actor!
We had the most absurd first interactions of all. From slapping you four times to you stealing my 'C A P T I O N', I guess college life passed. 
You seem to live life to the fullest so keep doing that give us more funny instagram live videos xD.
Cheers!",Avisha,True,60a8bca9819323d199d493a7,Nihal  Choudhary
15,"Hey,
It has been a pleasure knowing you Nikita. You have changed so much since the first semester, and still, you keep growing. 
Thanks for helping me out with the wallet incident. You came through at the last moment. 
I will never forget your kindness. 
Cheers

16,"I wondered how you always participated in multiple things and still managed to do well in all of them. I will never forget you as the guy who entered the lab 40 minutes late but aced the course in the end. This is a distant memory, but we hosted a terrible DE together where we fell short of adjectives to use :P
Well, it was a little less terrible with you. 
Also, all seemingly drunk texts from my phone were sent by sober me and my sober accomplices xD. 
Cheers!

17,"Nitik man, you were my lifesaver in the CHM lab. I remember we instantly clicked and kept talking outside the lab, missing out on our experiment xD. 
You were always quite approachable and friendly. I like your straightforward way of talking. 
Thanks for being a great partner!

19,"Prathammmmm, we get another year of ranting and bitching at CCD! 
Our random walks starting and ending at CCD were always super fun. I think I don't have any other friends with whom I have traveled so much. We have shared some of the most incredible memories in Taiwan together. Thanks for your support there and also for washing off the utensils :P 
I have greatly admired your dedication and persistence to learn new things and deal with boomer professors xD.
Looking forward to meeting you soon!

20,"Here I was thinking to surprise you by reminding you about the first time we met in your memoir. Well, things don't always go to plan, just like those interviews xD. I remember it didn't take me much time to be comfortable around you. You are kind and make it easy to talk to you. I had a lot of fun with you during the CGS course, where we totally copied our way out. The camaraderie, panicking together till the last minute, hurriedly figuring out our codes, and then framing our defenses when we almost got caught xD, were the most fun times of that semester. 
You always gave a fun and kind vibe. Thanks for all the cheerful times!!",Avisha,True,60ae451c659165b3aa644e2a,Priank  Prasad
21,"Hey Misa chan,
I am glad we met in Freshers. You were an absolute delight to be around. Thanks for forever charming cosplays and cute selfies.

22,"Let me begin by quoting our friend Peter Porker- 'How dare you fucking say pleasure?' 
It's funny how our friendship originated from Facebook comments. Knowing you and your humor has been great for me. You have a humble presence which makes it very easy to approach you, even from other people's phones xD.",Avisha,True,60a68669819323d199d490b1,Pulkit  Pandey

I have always admired your discipline and attitude towards life. You have always been very kind to me. Thanks for being my friend and keep shining!",Avisha,True,60bf97aa659165b3aa6450f2,Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai
25,"Yo, tune summary likh li kya? xD 
I remember we first met in Phy lab. I wonder how would I have ever finished my experiments if you wouldn't have come and bestowed us with your wisdom. 
Thanks for keeping me alive with your humour and even darker humour during bad and good times. 
It was lovely talking to you, bitching with you and ranting with you!

26,"I remember the first time we talked was when you suddenly came up to me asking for a picture together on the fresher's night. You were always very straightforward and easy to talk to. I think we were destined to embarrass ourselves since the day we opted for the fashion show. But, it was a little less embarrassing with you people around me. Although we haven't been in touch lately, I cherish our time together in the first year (exchanging waves on messenger :P).",Avisha,True,60a685af819323d199d490ac,Shivam  Arya
27,"Hello another-friend-who-I-share-bday-with,
Seriously we've somehow got to stop this man xD.
You have always been a great company, be it in anime marathons, CCD hangouts, Vox meetings and definitely on birthday eves!
I still can't understand your weird choice of winter accessories in friggin' January. But, I think only you can pull off leather gloves paired with shorts in winters. You are very outgoing and always up for crazy fun. I admire your last-minute-mar-marke-kardunga wala cool!
Had a great time with you and looking forward to more this year!! 
",Avisha,True,60c23744659165b3aa645b84,Shreyash  Ravi
28,"Hey buddy,
 We definitely had an interesting first encounter. The one where I was supposed to propose to you and make you awkward. I am glad I never did that prank, and we just remember our first encounter as something potentially weird! 
 I admire your perseverance and firm belief in yourself. These qualities reflected in all your endeavours and made you stand out. You don’t easily get swayed by public opinions, and that is why conversations with you have always been engaging and fun for me. 
 I mostly skipped German classes, but the ones I attended were quite fun with you around. Our practical memories are damm crazy with all the shitting-our-pants fun of practising German and enacting their scenes. 
 You were my true CCD constant punctuated with occasional walks and detours xD. I wish we could have hung out more, but you never left your soulmate, aka PK Kelkar Library :P

29,"Somesh, you always keep cracking me up. Be it with your panic attacks in EE labs or commendable acting skills in Art 105. Lab vivas are always fun when you go for them first xD
All the best and keep donning them leather jackets in concerts! ",Avisha,True,60c1cfa1659165b3aa645557,Somesh  Bajpai
30,"Yo,
Although we lost touch after the first year, we managed to make quite fun memories together. 
I still remember the day I drew on your while you were asleep and let you walk outside like that xD. Remember that one time we went shopping for something 'special' and ended up buying cheap chappals and churans :P
You are always part of happening things, and I loved talking to you in ESO tutorials. 
Thanks for the fun times and all the best!

31,"Thanya, I am grateful we have women like you at IITK and even more thankful that I got to be your friend. You are strong, and your words have always been empowering.
Your passion and courage are unmatched. I have greatly admired your candidness in the few conversations we have had. It was always fun catching up with you after a break and gossip about random stuff.   
Let's restart our messenger waves and never stop!",Avisha,False,60c22fa4659165b3aa645a9f,Thanya  B
32,"Yo Utkarsh!
You are so energetic and yet calm in the face of trouble. You made Freshers night super fun and totally rocked in the cosplay too. Your laugh really fills a room with joy. I will never forget your Ben 10 bag, CCD pole dance, dandiya night dance, and, of course, your ligma balls joke phase.
I distinctly remember this particular memory of ours. You gave me a very spectacular cycle ride, like in the foyer, during which we laughed so much. Those were genuinely fun times.
I am glad we became friends and thankful that you were a great one to me. 
Cheers and all the best!",Avisha,True,60c247f2659165b3aa645dfb,Utkarsh  Singh
