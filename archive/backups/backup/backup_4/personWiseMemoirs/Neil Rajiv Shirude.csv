This is definitely the toughest memoir that I am going to write.
Wing, Humanoid, Takneek, Roboclub, H205 - in sab ke saath kitni achchi memories judi hai apni. 
Orientation ke time tu wing ka sabse energetic aur enthu wala banda laga tha mujhe. Aur ye reputation tune jald hi waapas gain kar liya tha.
Humanoid team ke liye tera dedication alag level tha bhai. From my point of view, ek time aisa tha jab Humanoid team was mainly Abhay Varshney. Is point se waapas team build karne mein tera hi sabse bada contribution tha. Team ko South Korea leke jaane mein bhi tera hi sabse bada (technical aur non-technical dono) contribution tha hi. Sabhi ne give up kar diya tha, tab bhi tu data raha, aur end mein funds collect ar hi liye! Itna persistence kisi mein nahi hota bhai. Iske liye massive respect hai tere liye.
2nd year Takneek ke time teri Hall feel bohot paas se dekhi maine. HEC ki post chod ke Hall Captain banne ki soch raha tha tu, itna man tha tera Takneek jeetane ka. Raat raat bhar jagke bachcho ke saath baith ke bots banwaaye the tune. Yahi sab dekh ke to Y18 ke laundo mein hall feel aayi hogi!
Roboclub mein bhi you ‘led by example’. Mainly teri wajah se hi maine renom mein apply kiya tha (you may not agree here XD) Summers mein 3-legged jumping robot ke bachcho ko ek point pe pyaar ho gaya tha tujhse <3 Tech Meet ke bot pe bhi tune god-level kaam kiya, aur karwaya. Dedication aur persistence - you personify these qualities. You completely deserve the SnT Excellence Award!
I know I wasn’t the best of all room-mates, par haan, maine bhi kaafi grow kiya hai personally H205 mein. It got over extremely abruptly though.
Maze bhi bohot kiye hai apan ne, aur tere bohot maze bhi liye hai. Tere Dilbar dance ki video banaane ko tu dhoka maanta hai, par mai usko farz maanta hu. Ye maine tujhe bohot baar bola hai- “Agar tu sirf dost hota to mai video nahi banaata, par tu bohot achcha dost hai isliye maine video banayi”
Tu Bangalore, mai Mumbai aur Jay Gurgaon - could things get any worse? 
Par milte hai bhai jald hi. All the Best!
Love you bro <3",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60c20145659165b3aa645783,Abhay  Varshney
1,"Bhai Marathi mein memoir likh ke dil khush kar diya tune <3
Humne kitni saari football matches ek saath “dekhi” hai, kaafi interesting football discussions kiye hai. 
Bhai tu bhi United fan ban gaya to mujhe bohot khushi hogi. Maine is saal football achche se follow kiya hai (believe it or not, bohot saari matches poori dekhi hai). It's a good time to be a United fan right now.
Apart from football bhi bohot achchi memories hai tumhare saath <3
Jald hi milte hai bhai. All the best!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60c1a4d2659165b3aa64548f,Aditya  Raghuwanshi
2,"Yo Bahubali!
1st year se hi bohot mast aadmi lagta tha tu. 1st year summers mein apan room-mates the thode time ke liye, tab bohot maza aaya tha. Tere saath ki kuch bohot mast badminton matches yaad hai mujhe. Aero club ka tera dedication dekh ke bohot sahi lagta tha, aur thoda inferiority complex bhi aata tha. Corona ke chakkar mein mil nahi paaye hum college mein, par teri job location Mumbai aa gayi to mai bohot khush hunga!

4,"“Dost wali feeling kam, bhai wali jyada aati hai” ye ekdum hi sach kaha yaar tune. 

Bhai teri Sainik School ki stories to mast lagti thi mujhe- kaise tu seniors ka maar khaata tha and all XD ek mobile charger ki story achche se yaad hai mujhe. Train wali, aur Sports meets wali stories bhi yaad hai. Teri ye light-hearted stories detailed descriptions ke saath sunna patience ka kaam to hota tha, par mazaa bhi bohot aata tha. 

Tune ek baar bataya tha ki subah bhaagne jaana ho to brush waapas aake karna XD subah ki exercise ke liye ye mai aaj bhi follow karta hu bhai. Mai first year mein to randomly pride ke saath tere baare mein brag karta tha- “mera roommate 800 logo ki marathon mein just thodese margin se 2nd aaya”. 

Bohot interesting roommate tha yaar tu- first year meis tu jis passion se apna hockey pursue karta tha wo mujhe bohot motivate karta tha. Hockey, Clash of Clans, professional singing, MSO201 jaisa mushkil course- tu jaha bhi apna 100% deta hai, waha chaap hi deta hai. Bohot achchi memories attached hai meri in sab se <3

Glad to have you as an integral part of my IITK journey bhai. Milte hai jald hi!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60b9075b659165b3aa644f79,Anshuman  Pal
5,"Yoo Saini bro!! 

Remember how lockdown happened just before Techkriti in our 3rd year. Bohot achchi planning ke saath prep chal rahi thi. Apne time apan chart-paper pe tape lagaake kar rahe the practice, is baar 3 hafte pehle hi practice arena print hoke aa gaya tha! Jitni mehnat humne last ke 2-3 dino mein ki thi, utni mehnat 1-2 hafte ke liye bachcho se karaata. Phir to jeet hi jaate Techkriti, right? <3

Of course, bolna aasan hota hai, but maine IARC mein apna 100% deke agle 10 saal ke liye small robotics ka ek strong base banaane ka plan banaya tha- a “goal” that was inspired by your hardwork, dedication and attitude from a year ago! 

Apni Techkriti ke time bhi tera dedication dekh ke kaam karne aata tha mai. I had never seen anyone work day and night on something before. (tu at least 2 raat soya hi nahi tha) Ye mai pehle bhi bol chuka hu tumhe- Honestly, maine tere saath kaam nahi kiya hota to mai shayad hi apply karta coordinator ke liye. Thanks a tonne for all the motivation bro! Also thanks a lot for being a constant well-wisher of Robotics Club and being an integral part of the roboclub family in our 3rd year as well!

All the Best for all your future endeavors bro! Lets hope we meet again soon.",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60c20e42659165b3aa64581d,Abhishek  Saini

Haan, apni dosti thodi late hui, par tere se baat karne mein humesha hi mazaa aata hai. Stock market, paisa, alumni reunions, daaru, politics aise kitne saare interesting discussions yaad hai tere saath ke <3
Tumhare wing mein jab tune dog hut banaane ke initiative liya tha tab tere liye respect aur badh gayi thi. Aise achche kaam karte rehna bhai <3
Bohot energetic aur “feel wala” aadmi hai tu, matlab har cheez 100 percent feel ke saath karta hai.Alumni Reunion wale sessions aur SCGP mein certificates wala initiative chapwa diya tune bro! Aise hi bakchodi karte rehna bhai.

It was great to know you! Kaafi interesting personality ho tum XD
Firstly, meri handwriting ki taareef karne ke liye thanks :)
Jab lab partners the tab maine ek cheez observe ki thi- iItni frustrating lab mein bhi tum ekdum hi shaant aur thande dimaag se sochti thi, aur maine tumhe kabhi bhi gussa hote hue nahi dekha tha. Ye bohot respectable lagta hai mujhe.  
Udghosh ka failed plan yaad hai? Wo kaafi unlucky tha :P

It was amazing to know you man! Right from Electromania in our first year, maine tujhe bohot interesting aur brainy cheeze karte hue dekha hai. Tera passion aur dedication humesha alag level the- may it be your passion for McLaren racing, for the Australian Cricket team or for your Vox articles!

Humanoid ke early days mein jab hum mile the, tabhi se hi tere liye massive respect tha. Techkriti ke time manually coordinates set karke bot chalaana was fun XD Tumse bohot kuch seekhne ko mila, thanks a tonne for that. Aage bhi sikhaate rehna. Also bhai, tere saamne humility nahi, genuine inferiority complex hota hai :) All the Best for all your endeavors man!

Bohot mast aadmi ho tum.
1st year mein Phy102 aur ESC101 ka discussion yaad hai mujhe. Sahi tha wo :)
Kabhi bhi eco ya finance ka discussion chal raha ho to tera naam aata hi hai mere dimaag mein- itna zyada chaapa hai aapne sir! 
Eco double major ke liye tumne convince kar hi diya tha bhai mujhe (phir summer course mein bohot gandi grading hui aur mera man khatam ho gaya lol)

14,The first memory that I recollect of us is waiting outside the bathroom at 8 am together for our turn. First year mein hum kaafi ajeeb the I guess XD,Neil Rajiv Shirude,False,607c99a4b38952bbfbc68d3a,Jay  Mundra
15,"(Firstly, pehle wala memoir trial tha. You can delete that at will.)

The first memory that I recollect of us is waiting outside the bathroom at 8 am together for our turn (Campus tour bus wala bhi yaad aa raha hai, but I think Bathroom line wala pehle hua) First year mein hum kaafi ajeeb the I guess XD

Achche dost banne se pehle hi tere creative side ke liye respect aa gaya tha- Art105 ka “Endsem hila denge” song, teri maa wali poem, tera synthesizer bajaane ka passion (ye maybe choti cheez ho, but I have not seen anyone else play a song on a synthesizer without having learnt that song before). In sab cheezo ko aage bhi time dete rehna bro. 

One of the first most memorable nights on campus for me was the time tu, mai, Nikunj OAT ki chat pe gaye the. Is night ko 4 saal bhi nahi hue, par phir bhi bohot puraani baat lag rahi hai mujhe. 

My life at IITK would have been incomplete without you man. Blue World ke Columbus ki ride se Placements ki ride tak sab saath mein hi kiya hai apan ne. I agree that among all our friends, we spent the most time together, did so many things together. Aawaz karne wale tere yellow sandals, Udghosh PR, Tech Meet prep aur Mumbai saath mein jaana (btw this was the only time jab hum dono room-mates the- for 2 days I guess), Agra ki trip, courses saath mein padhna and projects saath mein karna, Takneek, summers mein Acting Gensec ka kaam, Robo vs Batti ki rivalry, aur mere room pe kiye hue random discussions- in sab se bohot achchi memories attached hai meri <3

Koi bhi semester ho ya Tech Meet ka sabse challenging Problem Statement- “is baar to sahi mein doob gaya” kehke alag level randi rona karne ke baad bhi har baar chaap hi deta hai tu. 

Of course, regrets bhi kaafi hai. 3rd sem ke tere dasse ki khushi nahi dekh paaya tha yaar mai, although tu dassa aate hi mere room pe aaya tha bataana :/ Campus na aane ka regret to pata hi hai tujhe. Aur tere saath bhand hona (abhi ke liye) reh gaya yaar bas. Wo bhi Inter IIT jeetaane ke celebration mein! Ye moment miss karna bohot hi zyada regret karunga mai. 

Par chill hai, apan mil hi lenge jald hi. Mere ancestors bhi Chittor se hi hai, isliye tu mujhe Chittod ki ek trip karaane wala hi hai for sure :)",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60b8a7ff659165b3aa644f74,Jay  Mundra

It was great to know you man! Humne saath mein kaam bas ek project pe kiya tha. Bohot systematically karwaaya tha tumne wo, I got to learn a lot from you then. Thank you for that sir. Aur tumhare saath hangout karne mein bhi bohot maza aaya tha.

As you said, we met pretty late. But I had known you right from 1st year, because of this amazing team that you led. If you remember, I said this in a Council meeting too- Team Aerial Robotics has an ideal structure and all teams should follow it, since all students coming out of Aerial Robotics are technically the most sound. From what I know, you (and maybe a couple of seniors) are the brains behind Aerial Robotics’ foundational success and I have mad respect for you. Also, I think I should apologize to Mudit for spoiling his treat by bringing the Ashwin agenda XD, but I am sure tujhe bhi pata hai wo kitna important tha.

Apan dono wing ke DOPA, DOGA the, isse baat start hui thi. Phir Art105 mein saath mein movie banayi thi, kaafi mazaa aaya tha. 2nd sem mein tera dekh ke maine bhi baal bohot chote kar diye the. This turned out to be a good decision, iske liye thank you XD
Agra trip mein to alag hi level mazaa aaya tha bhai. Haan, Men Who Built America wala discussion achche se yaad hai mujhe. Glad to know tujhe bhi yaad hai :)
Tera goggle bohot pasand hai mujhe. Last sem mein campus aata to pakke se chura leta :(

Bohot meticulous aur hardworking insaan hai tu, but you somehow make everything look very easy for you. In my opinion, “Things are under control” ye reassuring image personify karta hai tu. EE DUGC, TA202 project, so many batti courses and assignments, consulting prep, random doubts, time pass - in sab ke liye you were just a text message away. (Typically replied within 30 seconds <3).

-Yash is extremely persistent and dedicated in all his efforts. 
-Along with being a good ideator, he has the execution skills necessary to take any such initiative to completion. 
-Yash is a delightful person to work with and never hesitates from going out of his way to support others.
