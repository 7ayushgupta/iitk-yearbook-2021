Also, hats off to your stalking skills, koi bhi bandi ka naam lelo.. tujhe sab pata rehta tha 🙃.
Goodbye khene ke liye milna nahi mila (because of covid) 😔 . Let's hope ki jaldi milenge 🙂

1,"Bhai,
You are simply the most chaapu guy I have ever met. Tere dimag alag level peh chalta hai bro.. I can only dream of being like you. With all the intelligence and everything, tu kaafi humble bhi hai with a very good heart. I fondly remember jab mera 3rd sem chuda tha tab tere motivation nai wapas confidence gain karne mai kaafi help kiya. Thanks for clearing all those CS220 doubts and thanks for helping with your advice whenever I needed it. I am in-dept to IITK for meeting an awesome person like you. 

Let's talk soon. ",Harsh  Agarwal,True,60c25441659165b3aa646020,Abhyuday  Pandey

Tu hi mera inspiration tha weight kaam karne ka.. but tera hi weight badh gaya LOL. Sikkim mai dubte hue tu jab chilaya tha, woh kaafi funny scene tha 😂😂.
Last ke 30 din bahut maaze kiye yaar. Frisbee khelte mai ladai hona 😂, mama mio, ShopC jana. Aur woh late night campus tour. Hamesha yaad rahenge.

Jaldi hi milenge! Abhi trip peh bhi jana hai 😛

3,"Yo Ayush, my first CSE friend (outside wing).. all thanks to Sibanand for keeping us both in same dance group otherwise shayad mai yeh memo bhi nahi likhra hota 😅. Btw tere late aane peh kya ga**d marta tha woh (it will always be a funny memory 😂). Freshers dance se ab tak haam bhai-bhai baan gaye hai 👬. 

I don't know why.. but tu kaafi relatable hai yaar ❤️, with all good qualities hardworking, persistence, determination, and a lot more. One more thing terese zyada clean code koi aur nahi likh sakta😛.

Kaafi kuch haamne sath sath kiya, Freshers dance, searching for research internship (jisme tune mujhe dhoka diya😒), preparing for campus internship drive, NLP wala paper, collaboration in CS610 😅 , and many more countless things. Btw, I really wish ki tu Samsung wale interview mai MS nahi bolta.. maybe haam dono sath jaate Korea 🥺.  

You are an awesome friend too, who is always ready to do help whenever required. I will never forget any of your favors, including the figure you made at 3am ❤️.

Goa trip mai toh kaafi maza aaya.. thanks for being our driver😂. Also, that push-up competition.. jo mai jeeta tha LOL 😇. Also next time jayenge toh casino mai profit karna hai. May wali trip toh cancel ho gaayi, hopefully August mai jayenge kahi🤞.

Baaki I really hope ke touch mai rahe, and I'm gonna try my best for it. Because tu apne se toh kabhi message karega nahi😑.

PS: Woh Finland wala treat kab milega and Airpods??

4,"Yo Bhole! ""The most chill and chappu guy of Y17 CSE"". Bhai itna chill marke bhi kaise chaap leta hai? Abhi tak figure-out nahi kar paya mai. 😅
Hamne kaafi college time saath ki bitaya. Mai aur Abhinav, adha time toh tere room peh aake baithe rehte thee🤣.  First year Udgosh yaad hai (Bandiyo chakar mai hospi join kiya tha)🙃. 
First year Antaragni Day 1 ke baad raat bhar tere room peh GTA 5 khelna yaad rahega bro. Sikkim trip toh kaise bhul sakte hai, woh river rafting wala adventure.. It was a lifetime experience. 

Touch mai rehna bro!! Also, will be waiting for your Korea visit.. baaki ko bhi leke ana.",Harsh  Agarwal,True,60a60366819323d199d48908,Bholeshwar  Khurana
5,"Dugu bhai!
""Sabse chaapu banda of IITK"", and I am proud to call you bhai. I think hamari sabse pehli baat tempo book karne ke liye hui thi (first year endsem). Then TA201 team mates. Uske baad se sab kuch sath hi kiya. And tab se abhi tak we have become best of best friends. 

Teri tareef toh kya hi karu, but tera dedication is beyond praise. Itna motivation lata kahan se hai bhai? Also tera honest criticism, I love it and hate it at the same time. 😂 

I also appreciate tera sab kuch share karna mere sath, tere saare secrets ya tera next move. Makes me think I am important to you. Seriously thanks for that! 😊

Goa trip was incomplete without you. I hope ki August wala trip ho. And I'm gonna try my best to make it happen. 

Touch mai toh rahenge hi bas Europe jaake bhul maat jana. Also, I know tu Palantir hi join karega. But I am secretly wishing for some magic, ki tu Korea aa jaye (I know I'm being selfish 😛 )

6,"Yo Gosai,
Bhai tere jaisa chill banda nahi dekha, ese hi rehna hamesha. Tere bina 7 din quarantine mai depress ho jata mai 😂

Bangalore toh alag hi experience tha. Agar tu nahi hota toh itna maza kabhi nahi ata shayad. Woh lambe lambe conversations hamesha yaad rahenge. 

Hopefully touch mai rahenge!!",Harsh  Agarwal,True,60a652c3819323d199d48e3b,Gosai  Akash
7,"Yo Keshav,
I still wonder ""koi itna chaapu hote, itna down to earth kaise ho sakta hai"", be like this always. Tere dedication ki toh kya hi tareef karu, abhi recently hi dekha, extreme circumstances mai bhi tune kaam khatam kiya. Seriously hats off for that. 

I think sabse pehle hamara baat ICPC team ke liye hue tha. Since, then we have become like best friends. Haamne itne projects peh ak sath kaam kiya hai ki hamara resume bhi almost same dikhta 
😅 (obviously leaving the CPI). 

Goa wali trip toh hamesha yaad rahegi bro. Also, woh tera ice-cream wala incident (Hame bina puche hi tune ice-cream kha liya tha)😂. Let's hope August wala trip bhi ho jaaye🤞.

Touch mai toh rahenge hi. Mai bhulne nahi dunga. 😂
Also, crypto toh gaanda git raha hai ab ""Pottercoin"" ka kya hoga ??",Harsh  Agarwal,True,60a65594819323d199d48e6a,Keshav  Bansal
8,"Yo Pence, 
Tera smiling and carefree face dekhke kisika bhi tension khatam ho jaaye. I really admire your helping nature and your interest to learn about new things. Tera dedication toh alag level peh hai hi, we all know that. Baaki memories bhi bahut hai apni Agra trip, Antaragni mai bakchodi, etc etc.  
Aur haan kabhi startup kiya toh tujhe ping zarur karunga to get you on-board :p. Baaki touch mai toh rahenge hi. All the best for future!!",Harsh  Agarwal,False,60c25703659165b3aa646097,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar
9,"Yo bhai, 
Poore IITK mai I have known you for the longest time. And I have seen you become a better version of yourself over 5 years, following the same principles. 

Kaafi fond memories hai apni. Including Freshers dance, first year mai PHY103 ka depression (kya mast gaali dete thee haam prof ko), CSE courses ke assignment, ICPC, Nutanix (mc Suyansh) kaafi kuch sath sath hi kiya hai. How can I forget the birthday treats, tune hamesha birthday treat diya hai mujhe. I kinda feel sad ki mai tujhe kabhi treat nahi diya (hopefully sometime in future).

Goa trip mai toh alag hi maza aya. Lakin May wala plan cancel ko gaya, let's hope for August🤞.

Btw, mad respect for your eagerness to go into Quantum Computing. Only few people know ki tune kitna effort maara hai. Finally, all the best for your journey at Oxford. I know tu acha hi karega. 

Baaki touch mai toh rahenge hi. Asani se bhulne nahi dunga. 😛
 
PS: Bhai quantum wagrah toh sab theek hai, standup comedy zarur try karna lakin. I want to see you rocking the stage. 😇 ",Harsh  Agarwal,True,60a66666819323d199d48f91,Snehal  Raj
10,"Yo Vipul, 
Bhai tere jaisa banda nahi dekha. Tu kabhi questions puchne se darta nahi tha I like that about you. 
Hamara maximum interaction 2nd year mai hi hua... Subhajit sir ka project. it was a learning experience in itself. Kaafi ups and downs thee uss time. Tere wajha se hi mujhe courage aya woh project chorne ka. 
Bangalore mai toh kya hi maaze kiye. Woh lunch peh baate hamesha yaad rahengi. Mysore trip was amazing, I hope ki tu aur trips peh ata mere aur Gosai ke sath. But it's okay.

Hopefully touch mai rahenge!!
