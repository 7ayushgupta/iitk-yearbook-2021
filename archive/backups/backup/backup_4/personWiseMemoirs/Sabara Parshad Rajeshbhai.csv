Vo library ke din kaafi yaad aate hai jab poora group plan karke midsem/endsem se pehle milta tha and sab assignments magne baith jaate. MTH to jaise taise karke nikal liye sab. Par vo din hi yaad aate hai ab. Literally, kitne saare courses saath mein kiye hai hamne 😂 Apes Strong Together.

Also, tumse bargaining skills sikhni hai yaar! Intern ka stipend double karwa liya tha! Baaki to ab tum life mein 💸 chhaapne lag rahe ho uske liye All the Best. Meri placements ke liye kaafi call karke pareshan karunga so heads up. Thank you for everything. I am grateful that our paths crossed during these four years. Aise hi chaapte rehna.",Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai,True,60bce350659165b3aa645011,Aayush  Sharma
1,"Are bhai Sonthalia, I don’t remember exactly where we met but I think sometime during the third semester. Fast forward to today, I can say you’ve been one of the most reliable people of IITK. Ekdum Chill. Don’t change ❤️. Kuch bhi ho tumhare saath baat karke maza aa jata tha yaar. Kitni saari restaurants se introduce karwaya tumne BBQ, Kerala cafe and NH91. Kaafi courses saath nikale mostly because of your last moment notes. All the Best for all your future endeavors. Hope to meet you soon.

P.S. Your handwriting is lub.",Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai,True,60bce388659165b3aa645012,Aditya  Sonthalia
2,"Bhai, kaafi maza aaya tha yaar ENG mein. Tune Sparknotes se introduce karwaya and the course became 100% chill 😂. Zyada baat nahi hui hamari but kaafi sahi and cool banda lagta(with expensive earphones). I am thankful that our paths crossed. All the best for the future.

3,"Bhai Bhai Bhai, Tu sabse sincere and “seedha” bhai lagta tha muje but then Arshdeep ne bataya ki tu jitna lagta hai utna seedha nahi hai 😂. Jab bhi baat ki maine tujse, ekdum motivate kar deta tha yaar. I remember Arshdeep ne kaha tha ki Aman aur Sanjay - 2 ALPHA hai, ek room mein nahi reh sakte 😂. But seriously, kaafi chaapu, not so seedha banda. Aise hi chaapte rehna.
P.S. Shaadi mein khana khane bulana. ",Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai,True,60bce40c659165b3aa645015,Aman  Gautam
4,"Where do I start? So, let me start from the beginning. It was CHM101 Lab, I was standing in the front row extreme left and you were front row extreme right. Among everyone in the room, only you asked a few questions to Gurunath. I don’t remember the questions but that was when I wanted to get to know you. But then fate had it, we met during Arshdeep’s birthday, CPA, classes, Library, festivals and you became a very important part of my IITK journey. You may not know it but, you have taught me not to simp, you have taught me to read books, you have taught me Pasta is good and also to never stop trying when I fail at something.

I remember I was not at all comfortable with you calling me Paro, but thanks to you, that’s my new nickname now! And I like it 😅. You made me get out of my comfort zone and I cannot thank you enough for that. You had a very major impact on my journey and development through IITK. And how can I forget, you invited me to a movie and you introduced me to Vatsalya. I still remember you and Swastik fighting during the second year Techkriti 😂. Such a cute couple. I will miss watching horror movies together (Watch parties are not the same at all). I finally found someone who was more scared than me watching horror movies 😅.

Thank you again for everything. All the best for all your future endeavors.
P.S. Let’s plan to watch another horror movie soon.

5,"Hola. I remember the first time we interacted. It was the orientation of Y18s. I was on a video call and you thought something different and scolded me. I was TERRIFIED of you. Next, we also met during TA201 lab but we started talking friendly during library sessions. Kaafi restaurants try kiye tumhare saath - Anaichas, NH91, Kerala Cafe. Also, horror movies! Kya multitasking kar leti ho! Movie ke saath saath gaane bhi sunna, that's on another level. Also khud books nahi padhegi but muje force karegi ki mein book padhna start karu 😑. Also, its ""mein"" not ""hum"" 🙃.

I’m thankful that our paths crossed during IITK. All the best for all your future endeavors. Cheers.",Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai,True,60bce52d659165b3aa645016,Anshika  Verma
6,"Broooo! I don’t think I can fit all our memories here. But I will try my best. I may have gotten dementia (all thanks to you). I actually don’t remember how we started hanging out together 😅. Maybe it was the similarities and interests. But one of my strong memories of us together is you being my wingman in CC in the first semester. Maybe that was the time I decided you’ll be my roommate for the upcoming years. 

I know, this may start to sound like a love letter now 😅. We have laughed together, cried together, watched movies, TV series, anime together, and played many games together(Thanks for introducing me to Witcher 3). We also read Manga together (😜). Most of my time in IITK was spent with you. Be it in the room, or mess/canteen, or Library, or KD/RM/NCL. We have debated/argued over so many topics I can’t even count. I will miss our long walks after dinner, constantly recommending you to watch movies/TV series that I find good. (I know you still haven’t watched GOT and HIMYM. Ek baar dekh bhai, you’ll love it). I will also miss our pizza nights! Ohh man, how we ordered 4 pizzas and there would always be some that we could not eat so we had to find wingies who would like it. We have fought too, on many occasions over reasons which seem so petty now. I know I can be difficult to live with sometimes. But as far as I recall, I’ve never seen you angry or even a hint of anger on your face. Kudos to you and thank you for putting up with me. 

I am really lucky to have gotten you as a roommate/friend/bhai. Thank you for everything and I hope we will continue to be best pals throughout our life.

P.S. We need to go on a trip soon.
P.P.S. We have to get on with our startup soon.

11,"Jain sahab. Ritambhara se pehla interaction hua tha shayad. I was a total fraudie and tum dedicated. Maybe isliye pehle baat nahi hoti thi itni but after that, when I got to know you in MTH group, kaafi sahi bande lage yaar. Ekdum humble. I still envy you because OLA took you as an intern and I was rejected 😂. But over the time I have also realised that you totally deserved it. Kabhi bhi kisi bhi assignment/submission mein fraud nahi maara tumne. Kaha se laate ho itna dedication? Kaafi courses nikalwaye tumne. Thanks. And vo Z-Square ke niche wali photo mein tum reh gaye iss baat ka regret hai yaar muje. Jald hi milte hai sab and ek achhi group photo khichwate hai. All the best for all your future endeavours.

12,"Shrotriya bhai, tujse mila tab tak muje lagta tha mein sabse young hu group mein 😂. But tum to literally bachhe nikle. But kuch bhi kaho dimaag kaafi tez hai. Har exam/assignment submission se pehle Shrotriya ye batao, Shrotriya vo kaise hua, yahi sab chalta tha. I remember tum kaafi rote the ki kuch padha nahi hai but then sabse zyada marks bhi tumhare aate the 😂. Sabse pehle intern ki treat bhi tumne di thi. Be it intern ya placements ya courses sab kuch chaapte. And tumhari Bakchodi and PJs 😂. Kaafi maza aata tumhare saath. Thanks for everything and All the best for future victories.

Vaise vo tumhari “CCD wali treat” mein muje to bulaya tha nahi iss baat ka dukh hai bas 😂. Baaki to kaafi courses nikalwaye tumne and kaafi maze kiye saath mein iske liye Thanks.

14,"Hi, Dishaa didi (with double-A). I still remember I was mispronouncing your name for about a month since I met you 😂. We first met in the CC (Psychology midterms), TBH, I was so lazy to study anything and you were my savior! The first two years had many ups and downs for us, but since then you were one of my best friends at IITK. 

I remember us going on the movie date, having Mama Mio coffee in heavy rain, late-night walks on the library skywalks, and the study sessions. I remember all the lifts I gave you free of charge and I also remember crashing your leg in the library parking 😅. You introduced me to FRIENDS, BBT, and many other great movies and TV series. I will miss those Hall 4 Tawa Paneer dinners with a side of cold coffee. 

You were the strongest person I met in IITK. You kept yourself together through some very tough times and aced the academics as well. I remember you complaining about not getting shortlisted for any companies during placement tests. I also remember you getting the first-day placement. So yeah you have some hidden talents as well. I will miss our long talks about politics, religion, aliens, and other abstract topics. You were an integral part of my life at IITK. Thank you for everything and All the best for the future.

And somehow, we clicked. And since then, you have been an integral part of my life at IITK. You are the best coder I know and I can still rely on you if I’m stuck anywhere.

You were there for me every time I felt low. Now, I realize it was not me feeling low, it was just me being stupid😂, but still, you were there to hear me cry and console me. Tere saath chai peeke sab dukh-dard bhool jata tha mein. I remember our trips to Banarasi tea stall. You made me fall in love with tea. Up until then, I did not know chai could be so intimate. The trip we took to Mussoorie was awesome(Supreme included obviously). I tried alcohol for the first time with you. Thanks. You forced me out of my comfort zone and I’m thankful for that. Tu nahi hota to kya hota mera!

I still remember you and Ananya fighting in the Techkriti 😂. Such a cute couple. And believe me, you have many hidden talents and great potential. You are one of the most hardworking people I met in IITK. You taught me the idea of never giving up, even if all the cards are stacked against you.
