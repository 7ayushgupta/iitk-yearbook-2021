Bas pata chal gaya tha tab, ki sab sahi hoga. You and Anany took care of me when I was collapsing in the library and made sure that I got every emotion out which was bothering me then. I felt so happy that night after talking to you guys, thanks for always hyping me up. Also, tu jab bhi drunk hoke merko text karta hai maza aa jata hai, it’s super cute, please keep doing that  <3 Mocha night hamesha yaad rahegi, zoo wala day bhi kitna awesome tha, and then the time you and Anany went for the open mic.

You’re fucking amazing you know that right? I’m so glad that we had that drunken conversation in Goa because now I know we will never let each other drift away for stupid reasons (and that includes you being in Bangalore and me potentially in Gurgaon).

Hey Akshay, if I had to say who is the most enthusiastic person in IITK I would definitely say your name. Be it a small get together, birthday planning or a 7-day trip, your enthusiasm is super infectious. There are so many memories with you that a memoir can’t be filled with them all. Although my favourite is when we inadvertently took Hemant’s counselling session and the dinner in Liquid afterwards XD I remember in first year when you first gave me that lamp as a birthday gift even before my birthday, things like that and all your efforts you put, with the biggest smile on your face too, into your friendships are just amazing to me. Faizan was absolutely right that evening in Goa, people don’t appreciate you enough. Being guilty of that myself, I wanna tell you how important you are to me and the group.
Also, I hate that I had to miss your sister’s wedding for that stupid quiz, I do regret that a lot. I’m also amazed at your passion for SAE, regardless of personal or academic commitments, you’ve put the team first and that’s extremely admirable. Anyway, we still have had a lot of fun in our time and I know we’ll continue to do so! We’ll meet soon! 
P.S. Love your mocktails and cocktails ofc and that pasta we cooked remember? Lol fun times <3

People say I act like their moms in terms of caring for them, but you are someone who cares for me that way. I cherish and miss those post midnight talks when you used to barge in my room and just start talking lol. I need you to always remember that you’re worth so much more than how people treat you sometimes and you don’t need to think twice before stopping them from crossing boundaries. Also, it feels very privileged to know now that you share so many things with me, I’ll always be there but I guess you know that.I feel that you’re gonna be the one in charge of my bachelorette party lol and it better be a fun one, okay? I can’t imagine how I could have said goodbye to you too on 26th if we weren’t going to the same place. It’s gonna be amazing Anshikaaaaaa.

I’m sorry for being selfish at that time, I didn’t know how to be there for you in a better manner.
