6,"I wish I could write a book on you over a period of few months as every second I spent with you were exhilarating for me. I saw you on your Birthday for the first time and tried to gift you that pink foam balloon and passed out while looking at you as you were always such a beauty. Just your name is enough to fill me with enthusiasm that was the reason that I was able to get up from my bed and went to 8am class  to write down your name on the board. HSS to bhana tha, mera motivation to tumse hi tha wahan aane ka. Then came Tauu project, I can recall that you made our door opener a success when all of us gave up on that, even that lab was never tiring for me becuase of you. I used to ask people(nitesh, shrey...) about you and always tried to figure out some possibilities to steal some moments with you. You were one of the inpiration for me that I came back to that campus in those last months of my final year. Starting with chai samosa in canteen till almost daily nightouts, daily nayi nayi building dhoondhna, naye naye raston par jaakar sis guard k bolne par wapas aana, OAT m KK ka concert dekhna, ya Holi k din illegel tareeke se bahar ghoomkar aana, wapas aakr hall 13 ki canteen m khakar fir se ghoomne nikal jaana, Hall 2 se NCL ki taraf waali road par alag alag ped k naam par ladai karna,then NCL m paani peene k bhane sis guard ka ch***ya kaatna, wahan se nikalkar Helicoptor building ki chhat par jaakar uss breez ko feel karna, beech m yahi kahin IME building m poster k peeche deshbhakti dikhana, aur bahar nikalkar alag alag flowers par gyaan jhadna, Environmental bulding m fountain k paani par stone ko jump karana, RM k top floor se kanpur ko taadna, aur late raat bhootiya feeling m ""Mere dholna sun"" bjana, fir auditorium waale raste par pedo m alag alga insaano ki sakal dhoondhna, aage illegal tareeke se Park 67 m entry maarna,  wapas aate hue director waali road par pandey aur shrey ko race lgane k liye majboor karna, beech m tumahra hostel zaroor aayega par ye ghoomne ka silsila abhi thode hi khatam hoga, abhi to chawpati par dahi kawab bhi to khana hai, fir daaru ki planning bhi to karni hai (I really miss ki m tum logo k saath mahi pi paaya, but this isn't the ending) all centered around you and you only, ye sab to ek din ka chhota sa hissa hai, aise kitne hi din ham log saath m bakchodi kiye hai. How can I ever forget that sweet girl who came to meet me in my deadly quarantine(though again illegal :) ) and put a smile on my face. You are an epitome of inspiration for me. I have braged about you infront of almost everone I had known. I wanna live that life again... You made my days worthy to remember in the campus...You are the sweetest, cutest, enthusiatic, fantastic, heartful, adventuress, damn beautiful, girl I have ever met. I miss you and will always...Milte rhna, abhi to trip karna hai, daru pini hai, alumni banke wapas se campus ghoomna hai... even a lifespan will be less itni masti karni hai and what not. I'm eager to see you again, again kanpur wapas ka aane ka motivation degree se jyada tum hi ho....I'll always be there for you for anything, any sort of bakchodi.... 
see you soon

7,"I don't know how to recall about the ultimate person in IITK. You are the epitome of perfection for me. Almost 3.5 saal inferiority complex m raha, but when I met you, I found an awesome friend in you jo party dene m nahi darta. I'm proud that I met a person like you as even today I brag about you in front of people that you are such a nice personality. I hope korea m tumhe artificial ki jagah original maal milega. Ghar par R***iputram ki parampara ko aage badhaya hoga tumne. Apni dosti kam time k liye thi ye matter nahi karta, but ye pichhle 3 saal se bhi jyada bakchod thi ye matter karta hai, aur aage bhi hmesha hi rahegi, Those perfect shots in moonlight at the top of helicopter building, that illegal breach in environmental building, that IPL match, library k peeche ki wo forcefully bnayi gayi candid photo(ye shailab to kitna bada ......... hai), airstrip tak pahuchne ki nakam kosis and of course your choice of songs, how can I ever forget that and pretty much sure I will never get those moments back. I gave you some fever and cough as a parting gift as you followed me to quarantine in those last moments, no need to thank me for that. I I wanna see you in living a balanced life to jaldi se kisi ko pata le aur milwana zaroor. I'll be one of the first persons to buy your novel and go through it. I miss you brother.....

Intern m randi rone se suru hui ye dosti kise pata tha zindgi bhar rhne wali hai. Iss dosti ki gahrai ka andaza keval iss baat se lgaya jaa sakta ki last k ek mahine m 50% gaali maine keval tujhe di. Kisi ki leni ho, raat ko ghoomne chalna ho, breakfast m, lunch m, dinner m,wing m football k time, ya stairs par baithkar duniyadaari discuss karte time, cricket khelne jaate time, shaam ki canteen waali chai k time, OAT m backchodi k time, har party m, late night lambi walk par, ya hall ki chhat par ho, ya OAT rooftop par pizza khate time, har moment m I can remeber you. kya sahi jamti hai yar apni...Ek poore group m ham 2 apna khud ka joke maarkar has lete hai...I started to know you by heart during lockdown and it's always a joy to be around you. Randiputram k inventor k baare m jitni taareefe likhi jaaye utni kam padengi. Bhai ka dil intern k time aisa toota ki placement m ek tarfa jalwe the. Ladkiyaan to khud aakar takrati hai bhai se :), but damn! who cares, bhai apna sakht launda hai aise thode hi pighal jaayega, lekin fir hall aakar ussi raaste par wapas jaane k liye tadpna, that incident I'm gonna tell everyone ahead and we're gonna laugh forever on that. Talent aur dimaag ki koi kami nahi hai, bas wo aajkal hentai k technical anal-ysis m kharch ho jaata hai, Just remebering your name is sufficent to put a big smile on my face, bhai kaas ham log first year m hi mil jaate to mere liye IIT ki duniya hi kuch aur hoti, khair jitna 1 mahine m zinda dili se ham ziye, wo 1.5 saal ki kami ko zaroor poora kar deti hai, Thank you for arranging stay in delhi for me and someeone :) when I was coming back from pune, thouhg meri kismat chutiya nikli. Kitne hi nakam plan hamne saath bnaye hai, IIT m har illegel cheez saath m try kari hai, kya hi aura hai iss dosti ka ki bas ek doosre ki taraf dekhkar hi duniyadaari bhoolkar hasi nikal jaati hai. Tera rista to m kara k hi chhorunga, as I have bragged about you infront of everyone I had known, but m kya karoo log self reject maar lete, itne badi hasi k baare m sunkar. Khair kosis zaari hai, manali ya chandigarh m try maarenge ya jahan bhi rahenge. I was always laughing whwneve I was there with you. Thanks bhai for everything. One thing I definitely miss is to be with you again and making fun of every possibility in this world. I wish I can stay forever in your aura.

This rivelry started from second year and of course will contiue forever... but let me recall those last few years... we got to know each other after our first long talk in CC, again jahan ham dono apna apna rr kiye the, isme ham dono hmesha ek doosre se compete karte, kyuki kahin aur tumse compete karne ki meri aukaat nahi hai....I got a chance a to look at the human inside you after my favourite treat of momos given by you, kya hi thi wo raat, we almost became business partners on that day bas business abhi tak nahi khul paaya apna, I hope aage khul paayega. But that business idea was as unique as this friendship is: ""ek dukhi insaan ko doosre jyada dukhi insaan se milwana"". We both inspired each other ki fraud kaise maarna hota hai, whether it was a project under Himanshu sir, or was it a course under arnab. Khair padhai likhai se door chalte hai kyuki yahan tum ulta mujhe inspire karti ho, aur bakchodi par wapas aate hai, I remember that unique exam of all the tharki boys you took in chemical freshers ""Jisme hme 20 30 ladkiyon k naam btane the from our batch"" and we all failed in that. We both shared the same interests whether it was a trip plan to Goa (Jo wahan hoga, wo wahin rah jaayega) or it was a boring subject of mass transfer (of course I still have that sketch made by you in mass transfer class). Things always got spicy between us whenever we used to plan someone's marriage on OAT rooftop or discuss someone's breakup in NCL or in long night walks. I'm blessed to have a friend like you jo hmesha mere khane ka payment kar deta, you were the reason I got a chance to visit GH's canteen, wrna m kahan himmat kar pata GH m ghusne ki. Even though it's been a while since I met yoo last time but never felt that you're ever going away from me, this friendship is still as strong as it was ever(though tera phone abhi tak thik nahi hua).....Yar ek trip se kya hoga, mujhe jyada karne hai but pata nahi kab tum ghar se nikalogi, m to hmesha taiyar hoo tere saath bhagne ko but it seems mujhe hi aana padega tujhe tere ghar se kidnap karne....I wanted to roam around again in those lonely streets of campus but I missed that chance.... I miss you buddy... I hope this wait will be over soon and I will get a chance to discuss another dukh bhari khani of someone with you on a ""treat by you"".

Can you just imagine a person which such enthu, who compensated all the backchodi I missed in last 1.5 year in just a month. Subah k 8 baje ho, ya raat k 3 baje, You'll always find this guy there for you.
Dosti itni gahri ho gayi ki tune mere liye mathura m hi ghar le liya..(lol) I thought I'm most enthusiatic guy jo ghooomne k liye hmesha taiyar hota, then I met you, much above than me.. ek baar ko m back out kar leta hoo but bhai tu god hai...Hmare group ki backchodi ka aadha enthu to ekele tere se hi aata tha...I wanna live those amazing days again and again... subah 6 baje air strip se lekar, shaam ko canteen m chai k saath logo ki maarna, raat ko dinner k baad ghoomne niklna, aur beech m OAT m Ram ki bhakti karna wo bhi speaker par, to chaliye aage chalte hai, girls hostel k aage se niklate hue residential area m bachhon walon jhoole jhoolna(todne ki kosis karna), yahi se suru hoti hai apni illegal harkatein, director bunglow k aage se niklte hue sis guard ki maarna aur jahan jana mna ho wahi sis guard k aage jaane ki kosis karna, aur iss poore adventure m ritesh ki lete rhna is always constant. In those long walks under the moonlight with the company of your songs, i can remeber a continous laugh breaking the silene of untravelled roads in IITK. I hope hmari photo click karte karte tu photography sikh gaya hoga, secy to ban hi jaayega, but no offense Nokia is the brand :), teri aur shailabh ki rivalry ko maine India pakistan se jyada enjoy kiya.  The trilogy of geetam, me and you is one of the best thing I acheived in the campus. The best thing common among us is that we both were daring about adventures as I can recall the moments when you were jumping over the gate in environmental building :) The roots we sowed in IITK are going to be the motivation for a lifelong journey, abhi to trip karni hai saath m, though tere peeche bike par baithkar fat jaati hai, but still poora agra, mathura cover karna hai ussi bike se, paper publish hone ki party bhi to leni hai. Finally, as I sit on the rooftop of my mouse, I'm happy, I'm satisfied remebering these moments I spent with you, and moreover I'm proud that I met a person who actually cares about this friendship without any means..Milte hai kisi din pakka, aata hoo m tere ghar :)",Kuldeep  Singh,True,60c21474659165b3aa645877,Kushagra Gupta (R Gupta)

From the day one this memoir thing got famous, you're one of the topmost personality in my mind about whom I wanna bragg a lot. poore 4 saal m tumse bas complex hi khaya m, itna bada auhda hai tumhara, as far as I know all the people in IITK respect you except shrey:), and I got added to that list as well after long walk adventures we did together in the lit moonlight breaking the silence of untravelled roads of IIT including RM and the best thing I could remember in those golden moments were your choice of songs, bhai meri playlist change kara di tumne. I felt guilt on myself that I wasn't able to meet you in my early part of engineering, wish I could have known you earlier, your influence might have changed my life to a greater extent. I felt proud whenever I got a chance to sit beside you. I leaned countless things just by observing your character and most important one is that you taught me ""poeple matter a lot in your life"".

Tumahre saath illegal tareeke se campus k bahar dekhi gayi holi, aur fir wo GH k saamne kheli hui holi, I'm gonnna remember that in my finest moments of my college life.

Every line I'm writing here will make me cry, and I wept only for one person in the campus, whenever I took the name IITK, I can see you and you only infront of my eyes, infact I'll say my whole engineering was centered around you, you're the solely reason I'm standing tall in my life, otherwise it might have ended very soon, I may curse the god, china(COVID), administration, everyone who forced me to deattach from you, you're the feeling craving inside me. People can just imagine this friendship in which taking the name of each other is quite rare instead we always used some respectful words :), so those golden days used to start with, uth jaa la*de, class hai, but no fucks given as neend is the love of life. CCD canteen, MT , restaurent, antragni ki stall, ya campus ki koi bhi canteen, one thing which was always contant and will remain constant is  ""CHAI"". Raat ko 2 baje ek call permanent tha, jisme mujhe hmesha sammanjanak shabdo k saath canteen ka invitation aata tha, and that's where the roots of all the bakchodi in the world goes. The person who had ever known me, must have heard about you from me, you're the person with whom I have shared all my randi rona, as well as achievemnts, wing m dance karna ho, ya milke kisi ko gaali deni ho, raat ko 3 baje ghoomne nikalna ho, ya bc akele movie dekhne chalna ho, we were always together in all that shit..I never had a real brother but you compensated all the void for that. The roots of this brotherhoodness we sowed at IITK will continue to nurture our dosti forever. Aur haan campus m tujhse jyada zaroori koi nahi ho sakta mere liye, you don't need to feel insecure of girls:), though almost everything faded in that 1 year of lockdown but even in those times you were constant, we have discussed  a million of naver happening plans, including your dassa plans, kicked the ass of almost every famous personality in this world in our imagination(remebering the text written in my room in D-top:), we shared the same feeling about a million things in this world, have fought to each other at countless ocassions but after all chai is the solution to every problem, every rivalry. College life bhale hi khatam ho gayi ho par ye silsila to zindgi bhar ka hai, college was just the beeginning for the life we are going to celebrate ahead... I'm ending this memoir here because I don't how much to write about you, I can recall all the golden time we spent together, and words will never be sufficient to pen down our evergreen memories. Will meet you soon brother with two tickets for a trip in my hand.....",Kuldeep  Singh,True,60c238c4659165b3aa645bad,Shrey  Jain
