Par first year kaafi fun tha from hiding in washrooms during GBMs to ulte **** (not expanding I am sure you know what I mean) ko sote huye pareshaan karna (aur videos banana 🤣🤣🤣). Best of luck for the future!!",Avik  Pal,True,60c24b70659165b3aa645e91,Aditya  Singh
1,"Yo, the only person I have shared the same department with for 7 semesters (kya ho gaya that bhai us ek sem 🤣🤣). But haan those mess discussions were amazing. Smart aur humble ka bohut sahi combo hai, and it has been a privilege to know you. Hopefully, future mai paths cross kare.",Avik  Pal,True,60c24f08659165b3aa645f2b,Baldip Singh Bijlani
2,"Sir 🙏, aapse seekna chahiye what it means to be truly motivated by science. It's truly inspiring to listen to you talk about theoretical CS. Maximum cheez sar ke upar see jata hai but still sunne mai accha lagta hai 😅.
First year se wingies the to genius hai ye to pata hi tha, but over the years came to realize that you are super humble and actually have an extremely wide set of skills far exceeding academics. Last sem chaala hi aata, missed you a lot.
Hopefully will get a chance to meet in the future (and joke about that 2nd year wala thaapad 🤣🤣🤣)",Avik  Pal,True,60c24951659165b3aa645e36,Devansh  Shringi
3,"Yo, sweet and harmless to tu hai hi. It has been great sharing the journey in ML with you since first year (damn that has been a long time). Kya bakchodi machai thi NYO ki intern mai. Aisa recommendation system likha ki company hi baand ho gayi 😂😂😂.  Kabhi kabhi to aise heated discussions hue the peche se log chup karwa rahe the lab mai 🤣🤣.
698 mai kaafi toxic relationship raha hamara with all info coming from your side 😅 (sry about that). And those pattern matching to decifer ""something"" 😏😏😏.
Chal bro, best of luck. Stanford mai aise hi 🔥 🔥 🔥  laga dio. Let's meet in the US.",Avik  Pal,False,60c25311659165b3aa645fe9,Kushagra  Gupta
4,"Yo bihari (lol last sem pata chala tu bihar se nahi hai 😂). First year mai hi sabse zyaada interaction hua tha. But tere aur mowgli ke beech mai pange hamesha yaad rahenge. Kaafi soft spoken aur chilled insaan hai, aise hi rehna and best of luck!!",Avik  Pal,True,60c257de659165b3aa6460b9,Sandeep  Kumar
5,"Jagga Sir 🙏. Tere se seedha sadha insaan nahi dekha kabhi (and most likely wont in the future). The most dependable and honest person I have met at IITK. It has been a privilege to know you for the last 3 years.

Not sure how we met, but I think it was during the Y18 orientation. From there to calling u up in the middle of a class asking if you formed a group for assignment 🤣🤣 to the several classes and assignments we did together and finally to being (potentially) kicked out of campus by dosa, it has been a splendid experience.

Best of luck for your future and hopefully by the time we meet Yash would have won the bet (if u know what I mean).

P.S. Thanks for the nimbu paani tips. Thela chal gaya to thela ke shares jaruur dunga

P.P.S. Will wait for the treat in NYC next year",Avik  Pal,True,60c2444c659165b3aa645d5a,Shobhit  Jagga
6,"Lol mujhe bhi nahi pata kyu liya tha. Par yeh yaad hai few to nahi tha, mowgli ke room pe kuch circuits wagera lake rakhe the. Harami, humble, smart modes mai transition karna koi tujhse seekhe. Life mai grounded rehne ke liye tere jaise mu pe honest cheeze bolne wale log chahiye. Dev work mai to tu 1st year se hi phodta hai and I am sure future mai bhi aise hi bhakchod cheeze karta rahega.

The last couple of months were amazing and even being kicked out 😋😋 was worth it. ""Touch me to ni rhega tu, itna pata h 😜"" -- You never know,  "" Last me aate aate kya hogya "" might be some proof of the unexpected 😋. Anyways we are in too many social media groups to lose touch 🤞 .

P.S: High hoke meetings mat attend kiya kar",Avik  Pal,True,60c25606659165b3aa64606b,Shubham  Singh
7,"Hey, first year se wingies the but last sem mai hi sabse zyaada interaction hua and it was a blast. Wo moment jab jagga tere room mai mujhe troll karne ka video nikal raha tha, ulta uska nikal gaya tab mazaa hi aa gaya tha. Would have been great to spend some more time with you (totally my fault). Tera tv series ke choices bohut sahi hai I will give you that. Bohut helpful and honest hai. Kabhi na kabhi to milenge hi 🤞.

All the best, and darwaza band karna and jab room mai akela ho tab hi karna 😉",Avik  Pal,True,60c2593b659165b3aa6460e7,Vikram  Singh
8,"Hey man,
one of the most well-read persons I know personally. Apart from having a chilled-out attitude towards acads (damn motivating and hopefully someday I can imbibe even a part of it) and still acing it, your views on how to deal with life are brilliant. 

I have known you for the last 3 years, but was never aware of this side of yours, and damn I did miss out on a lot in that regard (the last couple of months made up for that only to a tiny extent).

All the best for your startup. Tu kuch bhi kaare phod to dega hi.

P.S. Aur kuch agar nahi kar paye to hamara nimbu paani ka stall to hai hi",Avik  Pal,True,60c246d9659165b3aa645dbc,Yash  Baheti
9,"Abe yaha pe bhi vim emacs aur arch ki baate 😫😫. Bohut diversified knowledge wala insaan hai bas thoda kam pareshaan kiya karta 633 ke samay. 3 din pehle mai isliye submit nahi karta tha ki 1 din pehle tera wala solve karwaun 😡😡😡.
We haven't spent a lot of time together but the few moments we did were epic. From discussing that startup in 2nd year (jo baad mai pata chala koi aur bana chuka hai) to discussions about money, power, god, history and what not over food (few hours before deadline 😱😱).
Tera transition into research from the person I knew in 2nd year (remember the conversation in the auto 🤔🤔) is outright crazy and inspiring. All the best and will be on the lookout for your name in the news.",Avik  Pal,False,60c24d5b659165b3aa645edd,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
