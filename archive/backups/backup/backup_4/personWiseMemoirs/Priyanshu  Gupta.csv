From introducing me to Animes(h) to bring the ever-ready canteen partner, thank you for making mah life so cool!",Priyanshu  Gupta,True,6076a31ac5325f8b69d1681e,Animesh  Nareda
1,"Hi Bhavjeet!
I wanted to start this memoir by pointing to some random event that made me meet a wonderful person like you. But as hard as I tried I couldn't even remember when it happened. All I can think of was us cycling through our RRs, random philosophies and weird theories at midnight.  You are one of the nicest person I met at IITK. Hope you do great things in life!
Keep Smiling!",Priyanshu  Gupta,True,60b37f43659165b3aa644eed,Bhavjeet  Singh
2,"Karan Broooo!
Saale first year me kitne library ke chakkar maare hai saath me XD. You are one of the coolest and smartest people I met at IITK. Kaafi memories judi hai, wing treats se lekar acads ke RR tak. Apne bulle humesha yaad rakhunga! Last 2 year jyada baat nhi hui apni but as Vaish Bro said, hope Goa Trip compensated it a bit. Really sad ki last sem mil nhi paya. 
Hope you do great, keep in touch <3",Priyanshu  Gupta,True,60c248c5659165b3aa645e24,Karan Alok Vaish

Sirf ek cheez: Bhai tu bhai se badhke hai! 
Bhai waise tu ekdum single piece hai :p . Tera chamiya dance, GPL ka darr ( Valentine Birthday :p) sab mere college life ki sabse yaadgar memories hai.  
Jokes apart, Bhai you have the warmth that can melt the hardest of qualms. Thank you for always being there:- always! Grades ke RR se relationship advice sab aap se hi li hai. Your inquisitive and positive nature has always been very inspiring!
Keep sending me Zomato Treats <3 Milte rehna!",Priyanshu  Gupta,True,60c246fd659165b3aa645dcd,Shivam Kumar (B Kumar)
4,"Yo Mah boi SidJay! Dude you have been my constant throughout the last 4 years. From Random Conversations to being the comrade in every shittiest scenario we can put ourselves in, boi we had it all. 
Still remember the first time we met in the ECO class where I first felt your sheer brilliance. I still cherish those study break random discussions, CCD bullas and ofc the phantom Bs. And not to forget that damn lizard!
Wishing all the very best to you dude! Meet you at MSR <3",Priyanshu  Gupta,False,60c243ca659165b3aa645d45,Siddharth  Jayashankar
