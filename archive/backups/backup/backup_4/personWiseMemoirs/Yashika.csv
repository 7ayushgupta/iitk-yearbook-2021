Yaar tere saat kaam karna kafi wholesome and accha experience tha.
Thanks for reminding me and calling me before almost every meeting. 
Initially, I was so scared if I fit in with all these chaapu people in acads team; I'm glad you were there. Hum dono ka team work toh sahi raha, GH acads team !. Also, how can I forget - logonke birthdays pe CS office sajane keliye hum dono toh super excited rehte the XD. 
HUL ke intern rejection ke dukh meh night walk pe bhi gaye the, ab funny lagraha heh. There have been many ups and downs, and we will reach where we deserve sooner or later!. Chaapu toh tum ho hi.
I wish you all the happiness and take care <3",Yashika,True,60a6c797819323d199d491b2,Abha  Tamrakar
1,"Hi Onbin,
  Yaar hum first year se jaante heh and kitne saare funny incidents heh humare. I'm sorry for not checking your treasure hunt request mail till second year XD. Our first interaction was that random DE dance compliment during mid sem and after that, we tried to solve a MTH102 problem the next day ( jo hua nahi tha humse :p). Uske baad toh bas TA202 and all the CHE classes. Pata hi nahi chala kab hum general friends se Super sober brozz to gold, silver, bronze bros to super attractive brozz bangaye. Thanks to you guys, I learnt some weird words Yonsh, smoll, nach-nandini and aarti wali birthday celebration. I miss all 4 of us going on treats and sitting together in classes. I guess I wouldn't have survived midsem/endsem night outs in the library or NCL without having some fun time with you and Nandini. Ohh! also you are my ISPP, but unfortunately, woh sem kabhi aaya hi nahi :'(.   Sound wave wala action kaise bhool sakte, yeh toh bas humhe hi pata chalta tha pure class meh. Also those Bhojpuri song suggestions XD.
   I had a perfect time in CHE because of you guys. Not just in courses but in general, I learnt to have fun in the simplest stuff possible. You are my silver brozz forever! (of course I'm gold and Nandini ko bronze banadenge :p) Aaj Kal toh hum teeno ke old photos meh bhi mujhe aise lagraha jaise meh third weeling karrahi lol.",Yashika,True,609c0434819323d199d47a1a,Abhishek  Sharma
2,"Hi Ankit,
I clearly remember that Dakshana wala incident and I was questioning myself "" Am I really that scary? why are these guys getting scared ?"" But now I find it really funny. Yes! humhare late night discussions were amazing, kabhi kabhi kafi serious discussions bhi hue the like future goals, all the India conservative mindset and stuff.  But overall, it was nice knowing a different Ankit than that silent, studious Ankit from Dakshana. Also, Thanks for attending all of my midnight birthday celebrations ;p. Dakshana treats ke alava hum inspire session meh bhi saatme gaye the vaise.  Todi aur frequent pizza party karni chahiye thi humhe

I remember my first impression of you. 'That girl with a high pony seems cool'. I completely agree that you are sassy, classy with a touch of badassy XD.  Before CS, I guess we had a few hi-hellos here and there. I'm glad it was you, Priyal and Abha - I had a perfect time with you guys <3. Horror movies at CS office and how Priyal was scared by your reflection after the lights out movie - were some of those memories that are just imprinted on my mind.",Yashika,True,60c0b4d3659165b3aa645231,Arzoo

Yaar mujhe DE wale dance se yaad ho tum :p, uske baad hall 3 TV Room ka ajeeb dance practise XD. Uss time hum kisiko dekh ke darr gaye the as if we saw some ghost ( I hope you remember this incident ). I  do remember deleting some of your fb posts and comments XD. Antaragni dance practice meh kafi maze kiye humne.  Dance club toh meh bhi kam hi gayi hoon after second year, abhi hopefully kabhi milna hoga.

I'm glad it was you, Arzoo and Abha - I had a perfect time with you guys <3.  I enjoyed randomly dancing with you during Orientation'19.

Thanks to CS, iske pehle sahi meh ni pata tha ki tu exist bhi karta heh.
Even I wonder how did I not know you until then, because out of all the people I have met in my last 4 years, I admire you the most!.  
I remember CTM selection process and a heated up discussion where I was very rigid on my point and felt terrible for repeatedly presenting the same issue.  You might not remember, but you told me, ""it's okay to deliver our point if you think it's right."" This statement helped me a lot that day. Thank you so much <3. I wish to stay in touch too. Take care! 

Hyderabadi veg biryani (if that exists ) bhejne ka toh koi scene nahi heh, Hyderabad milne aajana kabhi, tab zaroor chalenge!.

Even I remember that 2nd-year orientation thing. Uske baad we had small hi-hellos once or twice. Yes! Thanks to Instagram (particularly status), where we had good conversations, though we didn't know the exact incident initially, I could resonate with whatever you said.
   I remember hum ek baar library meh mile the, and we both were confused ki Hi bolna heh ya nahi XD. I hope agar kabhi ageh mile toh aisa na ho :p.

12,"Hi Esha,
You are the perfect roommate. I have been in the hostel from my 9th standard, and you are the best roommate I have ever made. I am so sorry for the alarm sound ( scooby doo pa pa.. even I hate it now). My first impression of you was she would be super smart, cute and very cheerful, which you really are. I wish we could get one more EDM night to go dance like crazy. Thanks for being there when I was feeling emotionally low in my second year :). I loved when aunty brought those different eatables which she prepared in our room. Please send me the recipe, that flavour is still in memory. Other than studious Esha, which most of the others know, I am glad I got to know Esha, who loves dancing during EDMs and treats, does Zumba, chit-chats, gossips, and is very fun-loving. Of course, never start a year watching Vivah; we know it's going to be a disaster. 

  We will be in touch, love you a lot and all the very best <3",Yashika,True,60a41544819323d199d48076,Esha  Gupta

  It's already 5 years!. I never thought we would grow this close when we were in Dakshana. Maybe the best is yet to come, but I have seen you grow a lot in these 5 years, and I'm super proud of you!. 
I still have that card which you just dropped in my room and went missing for hours. That card literally gave me and Priyakhee a low-level heart attack. Itna senti card kon likta heh!, we literally thought it was a suicide note XD. You made my IITK journey special with all those endless conversations about friends, crush, fashion, skincare, and many secrets :p. You are that BFF who sweeps out all the toxic people from my life (All the second year incidents) and that friend who is single till now ( so bois your chance is still there XD) but has advices to all my relationship issues. You already got your Harry potter cake, so you know what to do!.  Aur kitna hi likhoon yaar, goodbye note hojayega varna. Tujse toh milne hi wali hoon and firse apne saare naye stories detail meh bataoongi XD.

We have come a long way, vaise first year se pata toh chalgaya tha ki ab forth year tak toh yeh pakka dost rahegi meri. Even though we were busy with our stuff, I'm amazed how we could connnect so well whenever we spoke. I loved gossiping with you :p, taking out frustrations of batchmates, family friends, literally everyone. Every tiny moment made it special, be it watching ""The bold type"", numerical method assignments, birthday treats, first-year EDM, self-obsessed, that cute little hard copy of our photo.
