One of the purest soul of our wing. A guy who always wished good for others. You have always been there whenever I needed any help, be it in Udghosh Hospi or anything. Late-night discussions with you have always been fun. And even in this pandemic you always join the wing VCs irrespective of the time❤
Stay the same bro and keep in touch always.

The Ambani of our wing. Tere sath Valo sessions humesha kaafi mazedar rahe hain. Third year me kya sahi room decorate kiya tha tune apna. 
Second year me POR Jod the bhai tu. Astro club se leke photography club har jagah secy. Ecell ki party me kaafi maze kiye the. And you have been always our unofficial photographer (thanks to One+)
Kaafi chill banda hai tu, humesha available to talk. 
Firtst year me we used to play Loco and then used to transfer through GPay to get cashbacks 😂
Knowing you, tu kabhi bhi time pe nahi aayega kisi bhi event me :p Har baar wait karawaya hai.
Lucknow me thoda aur milte hain. Photowalk me bahut maze aaye the bhai saath me. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60c1c822659165b3aa645525,Anant  Sinha

I will always remember you as the ""work hard and party hard"" guy. The way you stood up in F2 was legendary. First year me humesha doubts batane ko taiyar rehte the bro. And tumhari branch change ke baad Batti courses me kami lagi tumhari. 
I can never forget your birthday celebration at OAT and then dancing in the wing until seniors came to shut our party down. You have always been an interesting guy to talk to. 
Also thanks for the ""Paris Darshan"". Video call pe Eifel tower dikhaya :p Aaj bhi video call ka SS saved hai.
You have been the kind of guy who was always enthusiastic to hang out with the wing, and have always been the front runner in all the fun episodes. Be it EDMs or Holi Party you have always been there with the wing. 
Never knew that car ride to home/station with you would be the last time we'd be meeting as college students.

Bro your enthusiasm is legendary. You have been the one who is always down to do something entertaining. Kabhi bhi wing video call ki baat kro toh tu humesha aata hai. First year me Ecell party me mast maze kiye the saaath me. Those wing pubg sessions with you were so much fun, lucifer. Tere saath discussion sessions were so fun. Ashu ke room pe saath me bakchodi me bahut maze aate the. And those sticker fights!!!
Tera ""Toh"" wala incident toh kaafi funny tha. 
You are one of those guys jisko 10 saal baad bhi bina soche call kar paunga because you are so reliable and helpful.

Insta pe mast content daalta hai tu bro. I still remember that day when you put deodorant on fire, creating different characters and all. Also that day jab tum aur Bibhu ek dusre ko uthane ka try kr rhe the first year me, that is itched in my memory 😂

लाइफ में कुछ लोग होते हैं जो पूरे टाइम साथ होते हैं लेकिन उनके साथ मेमोरीज ज़्यादा नहीं होती और कुछ होते हैं जो कभी कभी मिलते हैं पर उनके साथ गुज़ारा हर पल यादो में बस जाता है।  
Over these four years, we might not have met a lot but I can definitely the memories made with you are some of the most cherished ones. 
The first year Saini was the most out-going and joking chhapri nibba, I had ever met. B6-C6 wali bonding, those Mini Militia games and teri harkate were all too fun. Your hairstyle and hair accessories were soo famous :p 
I still remember celebrating your birthday in the canteen during the first year winter break. Also that NSS painting drive when we were just sort of busy taking pictures :p
Second-year Saini was the most dedicated person that I saw. Your dedication towards Robo Club was amazing. I still remember that late-night discussion about Robo Club Marketing where you told me about your plans for the club. 
Third-year Saini was just so different, you gained so much maturity (though still a chhapri nibba :p) Third year Saini was ke saath sabse zyada maze kiye- be it sharing Techkriti BT or discussing our issues. Devendra-Piyush ke room pe aake bakchodi karna, pizza khana were all part of this fun. Btw the wall art in your room was just awesome bro.

The oldest (or second oldest) member of C6. Wing me sabse mature aur chill banda hai bhai tu. C6 me koi bulla bole toh Ashu ka room yaad aata hai. Tere room pe kitne maze kiye hain bhai. Tere ko pehli daaru pilayi hai bhai meine :p
Teri GPL lene me humesha maze aaye hain. Tere sath political debates me kya hi maze aate the. Let's hope jald hi fir milen aur saath me daaru party karen. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a5764d819323d199d4868a,Ashutosh  Sharma

Sabse mast aadmi of my college life. Jiske saath masti bhi bahut ki aur seekha bhi bahut kuch. 
First Impression: Big Guy from Odisha, probably killed a few people before, who goes to canteen A LOT.
Can't forget tera Philosphy padhana mujhe xD. Second year me tujhe roommate banae ke liye almost lad hi liya tha mein. And I am glad. Tere saath din-raat gossips, ghar ki stories, aur mazaks sabme bahut maze aate the. You are probably one of the very very few people who have seen me cry in college. You have been someone jisse sab khulke share kiya hai meine. Tere se life ke baare me bahut seekha mein. Tujhe shayad na pata ho but tere random gyans have helped me a lot to grow up. 
Tere saath PUBG khelna (Ping968 <3) was/is so much fun. Esp bcoz you are a pro gamer. Be it cards or any shooting game.
Can't forget that day jab teri lab miss ho gayi thi. 😂
You will definitely go places, bro. You are one of the most hardworking and dedicated (not to mention brilliant) guy I know. 
For me, you would always be the big burly guy who is very mature of his age and pure by heart.

First year me alag hi dedication ke saath dance practice me jaata tha tu bhai. And we used to go watch the show because Gavish hai usme. 
My very first memory of you: On our very first GBM when DoSA asked all the students to leave if they were not comfortable and people started moving out, you were the one who asked us to keep sitting there. Although kafi fati hui thi fir bhi baith gaye the there saath.
This pandemic made our bond stronger, partly because during regular time you were almost never in your room :p 
I really enjoyed playing PUBG with you guys. That used to be one of the most entertaining things during early pandemic. Fir PUBG ban ke baad Psych, Among Us bhi try kiya tha. 😅
Also thanks for helping me out in CHM and MSE course. Tere bharose hi kiye wo courses. I never had to study in those bcoz I knew you were there to cover us. 
Also your advice to shout ""𝐾ℎ𝑎𝑐ℎ 𝐾ℎ𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟 𝐾ℎ𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟 𝐻𝑢 𝐻𝑎 𝐻𝑢 𝐻𝑎"" right before the start of interviews, really came handy. (I can't believe I am writing it, but it really brought down the anxiety levels xD)

Udghosh-Techkriti me saath me hospi me nhi hota tu toh ghanta kuch ho paata. Second year me just saamne room tha tera kabhi bhi ghus jao, humesha open. Tere se baat karke humesha accha lagta hai.

We have soo many memories together and words can't express how grateful I am to have you here with me. All those late-nighters which started with ""Raat bhar me kar lenge"" and ended with ""Bhai subah 6 baje jaga dena tab padh lunga"" are some of most cherished memories. Those throughout the day poker sessions, were the highlight of our third year. 
Saath me mess jaane se lekar saath me lab jaane tak, you were always there. IITK me tere saath sabse zyada cheese explore ki hain meine. Wo Shivratri pe mandir jaana and room pe songs pe dance karna... Saari random bakchodi aur discussions sab bahut yaad aate hain ab.
Tere TInder Tips ke next episode ka wait hai. The first 2 episodes were awesome :p
I still remember Antaragni me jab tu bhand hoke (almost) kaand kiya tha. Kya mast time the wo!
First year me guitar ke saath photoshoot ke alag maze the. Tera gym aur music enthusiasm alag hi level hai. 
Oh and how can we ever forget Numerical Analysis. Proxy pakdi gayi thi aur fir prof se mile bhi nhi hum dhang se :p
The best part about you is ki tujhe kuch bhi bata du tu kabhi judge nhi karta and humesha openly cheeze bata deta hai. Teri ye No BS personality is amazing bro.
My only regret is ki hum kabhi saath me hand nhi hue. Yaad hai Goa me raat me tu humare appt aaya tha 😂

Same coaching, Same college, same branch, same wing, same gaming team, same courses failed and same company me job.  (Ab zyada ho rha xD)
Our 'mutual friend' count over FB is a testimony to our friendship.

That Summer of Code project broo.... Kya hi fraud maara tha humne and us prof ne effort ki dhajjiyan uda di :(
Wo PE me jaake ma'am se raaat ki permission lena, thanks a lot bhai uske liye. NSS me kaafi kaam kiya humne saath me :)

Bhai mein tera example deta hu jab bhi talented logo ki baat krte hain. Tera transformation meine apne saamne dekha hai. First year me aaya hua banda jo pehle kafi kam baat kr pata tha ab mast convo carry karta hai.  You started programming aur ESC me A* le aaye. Explore krte krte kitne saare projects kr diye that you had to remove some of them from your resume :p. You started playing PUBG, and you literally (Ace)d it there. 
Everything that you tried, you have aced. And I am pretty sure ki aage jaake tu jis bhi chees me jayega you'll find your way to the top. I say that not only because you are talented but because you are fearless. Jaha hum log darr ke alag ho jaate the, you have been the 'Jo hoga dekha jayega' types.

Odessey Treasure Hunt, Takneek aur SnT code me kya hi maze kiye hain bhai. Saath me questions solve krne ka try karna.... kitne mazedar moments the wo.
DSA ke question se lekar Valorant tak har jagah you have been the one carrying me.
One thing that I am super proud of you about was your SCD profile. Although deleted, original copy mere pass abhi bhi padi hui hai :p
And that one time you commented on a YT channel (thanks for that, I was secretly happy for that :p)
You have been one of those guys who was always up for group video calls. Those late-night video calls and discussion sessions are some of the most cherishable memories. 
You were an integral part of my placement journey bro. From the silliest doubts to the most challenging problems you were always there to guide me. 
Our PUBG and Valorant sessions have been legendary. Ping968 ka Miramar match kabhi nhi bhul sakta hu.

First-year me star gazing to third-year me next-door-roomie, it has been a truly amazing bonding, at least for me. From canteen trips to mess trips, from discussing politics to life experiences, from participating in treasure hunts to pubg rank push, from waking up for breakfast to late-night skribble games, it has been really fun times.
