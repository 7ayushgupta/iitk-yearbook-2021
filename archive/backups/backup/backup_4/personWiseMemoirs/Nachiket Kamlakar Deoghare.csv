I know there will be a day, when I will be trekking in the jungles of Kerala or Tamil Nadu, searching for some entheogens and discover you there ..... ""coincidentally"". Love you brother !!

1,"My strongest memories of campus are from the first year, others are a bit hazy...
You are like family to me. I remember we had many long discussions, and they were really beautiful, although I have forgotten the contents. The walk we had on a foggy night  with the lights creating optical   illusions near the main ground, and the walks inside academic area can never be forgotten. You are the second person who introduced me to the beauty and sacredness of creation all around me.
You were also the first person who cautioned me against my behaviours and cared for me when i was lost...thank you for that.
Stay Lit !! ",Nachiket Kamlakar Deoghare,True,60c2400a659165b3aa645c92,Gunjan  Jalori
