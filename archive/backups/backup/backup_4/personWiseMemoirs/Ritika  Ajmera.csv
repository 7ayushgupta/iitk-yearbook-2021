You are definitely the most chill person I have known. I don't know how I would have survived the eco department without you. Can't thank you enough for all the econometrics assignment you did xDDDD, for making all the wonderful notes. Vaise I seriously dont remember the first year vala incident when I asked you about your relationship lol :p Last month I am glad we did a lot of fun together especially the graffiti 😏. And ofcourse, ye to sbne likh hi diya hai ....hatsoff to your chipkali bhagane ki skills! All the very best for the new chapter of your life and love you <3 ",Ritika  Ajmera,True,60bb739c659165b3aa644fd8,Arzoo

Writing these memoirs are actually tough lol. There is so much to write, smajh nhi aata ky likhe ky nhi. You were my travel partner always <3. I guess hum sbse jyada baat tb hi krte the and poore sem bhar ki gossip kr lete the. I think we had a conversation for the first time about the weird connection our parents had lol xD. As we have discussed this many times, I am always amazed by the transformation you have had over these four years. From being a shy, innocent, reserved person to becoming an extrovert, bold and a fearless girl you have had your journey. And yes hatsoff to your contacts, mjhe aur pratigya ko to sari cheezein tjhse hi pta chalti thi xD This last month was a lot of fun and I loved this influencer phase of yours :p and I wish I could have spent more time with you guys. All the very best for your upcoming life and tu aur pratigya keep sending me gifts 😌 Love you piyu <3 PS: Tripod is going on a trip for sure!",Ritika  Ajmera,True,60ba9884659165b3aa644fbe,Priyal  Bhandari
2,"After infinite procrastination, here we go! 
Where do I start from smajh nhi aa rha. I guess we first met in 2nd year Ritambhara only. Far from the reality, you, me and deeksha so seriously discussing kise bulaye parineeti chopra, kangana ranaut, preity zinta etc etc lol. I guess we were the most enthusiastic people for Ritambhara. Bhayiiiiiii kitni fun memories hai sath me. Oh god ...remember that tension, interview ke time ritambhara se kata diya to xD I still remember you saying ""Tears were rolling down my face, but I was not crying""....that was lit 🔥😂 And then that prank jo krishna aur maine kiya tha ...I guess thoda jyada ho gya tha bt it was super fun xD I can never forget that incident jb driver bhaiya ne mast gaadi park ki thi and you were like ""bakchod bhaiya"" aur fir bhaiya offend ho gye the xD and you justifying it with ""are bhaiya ye hmare yha gaali nhi hoti :p"" And so much more pta nhi ky ky yaad aa rha. Fighting over the oriflame and forrest essentials products, NNM adah sharma aa rhe nhi aa rhe, and then karishma sharma ka last moment pe convert hona. I have to say I am a big fan of your hmesha smiling face. Alag hi positive vibes aati. I love your company and hope to stay connected always. And trip pe chalo jldi!!!!!

3,"Yo Dost! I don't really remember exactly when we became friends (I just remember we watched a movie together in second yr summers) but I am glad we did. And here we are what we can call as virtual best friends✌️. You are amazingly weird guy with a lots of cousins and a person who is extremely obsessed with the organization of things (which I love btw) xD. Hope we'll survive rest of the semesters and the placements together as we survived this year. Definitely last yr would have been boring without you. Hope we'll make infinite more memories together in our last yr on campus (if we ever returned :p). Cheers to our friendship 🤟

I guess our bond strengthened while 2nd year Ritambhara. Far from the reality, you, me and Ayush so seriously discussing kise bulaye parineeti chopra, kangana ranaut, preity zinta etc etc lol. And then that confusion kha jaaye counselling service, E cell, Ritambhara, tera hss. I can literally remember us discussing it everytime we met in 4th semester xD. And yes can never forget that scary course - Numerical methods. It was always fun whenever we talked. And abhi to poora ek saal baki hai.

You know we didn't meet for the first time through Ritambhara. As a matter of fact, we have a trip together ...MANALI ! Although I don't think we ever talked on the trip, I just knew you are a friend of jatin. I formed an impression of you as a silent person lol. Little did I know ky bakchod insan hai tu. Obviously Ritambhara could not have been more fun without you , Ayush and Krishna. And especially the meetings with head events xDxD. Kitni gaali khata tha be tu....daya bhi aati thi bt hasi jyada aati thi lol. I'll always miss the way you called ayush ""abey bhosdike"" :p And then remember that failed attempt of ours to convince every jeweller to give us money xD But I seriously respect your dedication towards UPSC preparation and I am sure you're going to do great in your life! On a serious note, bada aadmi banke bhool mat jana 😜 Keep in touch! Baaki hmari ek trip pending h vo plan krte hai asap.

I have always admired you for your enthusiasm towards doing challenging projects and courses and dedication towards finance. I also admire you for your googling skills xD I am still amazed how you managed to get a dussa in last semester inspite of being clueless for most of the semester lol xD And that topology midsem ...vo tp hmesha yad rhega lol.

We have been constant companions throughout the four years from doing TA together to bearing weird professors of eco department. And yes that manali trip will always be close to my heart.... I literally knew nobody on that trip (ofcourse thoda bht jaante the sbko) but after that trip kaafi acche dost ban gye the apan log. I have always admired your energy for doing so many things .... you were literally everywhere... be it drams, hec, basketball, antaragni, acads, film club, galaxy and what not. And yes film club se yad aaya I still get the horrors of that short film lol xD (kidding). Eco department ka naam to roshan kr hi diya hai 😌 I am so proud of you.

Finally after infinite procrastination here we go !!

Honestly, I cannot imagine these four years without you <3. You were literally 50% of my campus life. Lets start from the very beginning. The day we first met, when swadha and I went for a random walk around the wing and we had a little chit chat. At that time only I was very sure that we are gonna be friends. And then eventually we started talking more and became very good friends very soon. Ofcourse we have infinite memories together. From making your braids, to random strolls, to never ending bulla, to somehow passing PHY103 even after poori raat muggne ke  baad (and ofcourse you were not studying xD), to discussing about our crushes :p, to literally getting up at 5:50 and somehow reaching the PE ground at 6 in the fear that we won't get the refund, to watching shady movies together, to spending that memorable night at faculty building rooftop <3 and .... ahhh not forgetting our beloved SHYAM and uski khtarnaak thookne ki shakti lol. You were always the gamemaster of our group, pta nhi kha kha se nye nye games laati hai (but still nothing matched the level of donkey xD) and its because of you that I can't undo things like ""saas bahu aur sensex"", ""arvind desai ki ajeeb dastan"" and pta nhi ky ky from my memory lol. Btw I am still making A se shuru hone vale ladkon ki list (although I believe we can remove the A criteria now :p). I really hope to see your korean shows one day and appreciate them. To be honest, you are a gem of a person. I have literally seen you care so much for your friends. I cannot thank you enough for listening to all my rants. That one hour bulla when I came to your room after the whole day was always so refreshing. All the very best for your upcoming life and tu aur priyal mjhe gifts bhejte rehna 😌 and come to campus if situation improves. and han campus tu ghumayegi hume and especially Audi 😈. bhai hmari goa trip ab bhi sapna hi hai ...next time kch nhi sun rhi mai.

Thanks for always listening to me - I could literally tell you everything knowing that you will keep it a secret. Thanks for making me try that blueberry yoghurt and for filling the CS form for me and priya :p. One time you wore a one-piece and straightened your hair...that day will always be remembered xD.
