2,"Hey beautiful Ex-roomie...Even though  I didn't get much chance to interact or spent time with you 1st sem...but still 1sem ki sare memory av b vividly yad h. I was not your behana but still I was always with yours behans and with Gargi at that time. Tu har week me ghar chali jati thi jb ki me 1yr me ek bar jati thi...At that I really feel jealous... I was quite introvert at that time and tune mere ko HSS me introduced kiya tha...me continue toh nhi kr payi but still HSS k seniors mujhe ending tak hmesha help kiye..
It's always feel like home whenever I talk to you or Pragya... afterall you two are the 1st one with whom I started this journey first.
Mere mummy av v tere bare me bahot puchte rhte h..I hope us time me jyada disturb na kiye ho call kr k...
Baki I hope aise ho touch me rahe...
Take care 🙂

6,"First I want to say I miss you since it's been a long time I've seen you, visit your room, talk to you about useless stuffs, go to shop, garden, canteen, outside campus together.
I hope we would be in touch together even after this graduation. You have been one of my close friend since 1st year and I'm glad that I made a friend like you.I'm happy that you transform yourself with a better version of yours after 2nd year Udgosh, I wish I could have done the same. Honestly speaking I feel a bit jealous at that time that I could not able to spent more time with you and I guess I've told you this before also. One more thing that really found irritate when we go to any shop is that you are very very very particular about the thing you buy. That's good in a way, but still it's a bit annoying. But your taste and choice in any thing like food, sweets, gifts, decor etc. all are too good. That's why I ask you first before buying anything. There are a lot of things where you struggled and came with improvement. There are very few people around whom I feel comfortable in campus and you know you are first one of them. There are a lots of flashback are coming to my mind right now, I don't know how to put those things in words. I just hope we could again have fun as before in campus. I hope 17th March 2020 will not be the last time of our togetherness. Hope to see you soon. Stay safe...Take care",Lopamudra  Singh,True,60a8aab8819323d199d493a1,Sireesha  Gugulothu
