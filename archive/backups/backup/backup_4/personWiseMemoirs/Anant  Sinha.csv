You are perhaps my very first best friend in campus, wo first year mein kitna hi hangout kiya tha apan ne, Freshers night, Janmashtami at OAT, CCD mein bday treat, Ganesh Puja, all these memories with you will be cherished forever ❤️. Tera transition from an innocent religious guy to a ladies man, saakshaat dekha hai maine 🙌🏻. Wing mein kuch bhi bakchod karna ho sabse pehle log tere paas aate they, you were the epicenter of almost every and any sort (😉) of bakchodi in the wing. And words just can't describe last month mein humne kitni hi bakchodiyan ki thi, we made memories for a lifetime in that one month, none of which could have been possible without you ❤️. Also tu nahi hota toh Goa ki sabse memorable evening (atleast for me XD) ho hi na paati (bdw thanks a lot for being there for me that day 🥺❤️).Here's to countless such trips in the future 😉🍻. Love you bro and all the best ❤️",Anant  Sinha,True,60c22222659165b3aa64596b,Raghav  Singh
1,"Heyy Roomie, you have been one of the most wonderful people I met in the campus. One of the most cheerful, helping, studious person of our wing. Those night outs in which in exchange of coffee you taught me and others the entire syllabus  one night before the endsems will always be cherished by my memory. Although wo chupke mobile pe movies dekhne ke bahane twra",Anant  Sinha,False,60c21dd8659165b3aa64591d,Rahul  Rohit

Although wo chupke mobile pe movies dekhne ke bahane tera magai karna bhi yaad rahega 😒. I cannot thank you enough for your help and suggestions during internship drive. One confession here 😅, I literally copy pasted your skills set in my resume XD (ab thi hi itni attractive skill set ki raha nahi gaya 😍). Trips to Goa, Lucknow, ZSquare, BBQ are just few of the countless memories I have with you ❤️. Here's to many such trips in the future 🍻 All the best buddy!!

3,"Heyy broo!! You have been one of the most dedicated, sincere, helpful and high-spirited person I met in the campus. 3rd semester ki wo humaari DS&Algo ki journey along with Vaibhav humesha yaad rahegi. From getting caught for plagiarism, Prof ke saamne rona XD, to late submissions we went through literally everything in that course XD. I even remember you saying ""Bhai Anant ne sab dekh liya"" when I submitted the assignment on the last possible day with penalty of 15% XD. Our Goa trip is one of the most memorable trip of my life 😉. Thanks for initiating and ofcourse making the best possible itinerary for it XD. Kaafi bakchodiyan ki humne Goa Trip mein and ofcourse that particular evening will be one of the most memorable evening of my life XD (bdw thanks a lot for being there for me that day 🥺❤️). Here's to many such trips in the future 🍻 All the best bro ❤️

4,"Heyy Broo!! You have been one of the most helpful, sincere and wisest person I met in the campus. Koi bhi suggestions ya advice chaahiye ho toh you were the perfect guy. I still remember your invaluable suggestions and hard work during my senator's campaign. Although we didn't win, we made a priceless memory for lifetime. Chaahe studies ho ya campaign ya Valorant your advices/scoldings(😉) have always been very important. You are the uncrowned IGL of our team 🙌🏻. Not to forget the strategy you suggested me in Casino for Roulette which made 90% profit on our first night 😎. Our numerous trips to ZSquare, BBQ, and ofcourse Goa (😅) will always be cherished in my memory. Thanks for being a true friend and a mentor at the same time 😊. All the best bro ❤️",Anant  Sinha,False,60c23812659165b3aa645b9a,Umang  Malik
