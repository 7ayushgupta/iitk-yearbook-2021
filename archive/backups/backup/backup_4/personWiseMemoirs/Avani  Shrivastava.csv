Can't remember the first time we met but yeah after talking to you a couple of times I knew right away you'd be my go to person. I annoy you so much with all the grievances of my life but you never fail to make me feel better. You continue to have faith in me when I don't. You keep me going no matter how hard the days get. There are so many things I wanna thank you for starting with you always telling me to prioritise myself to you quoting my feelings for me. You are an incredibly amazing human being. Please don't ever change. I'm looking forward to gossiping about job life with you. Meet me soon. Love you loads!
