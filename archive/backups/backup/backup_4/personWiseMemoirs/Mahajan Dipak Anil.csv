Aur Bhai Adi!! Hopefully abhi BT khatm ho gayi hogi zindagi ki kaafi had tk!! I was really happy the day I got to know youve sorted things out!! I know it had been hard for you for nearly a year but you made it through anyway!! I still remember the zumba in the orientation, when most of the people around us were not exactly interested in dancing and then there were us - OAT ke sabse last wali seedhi pe jo saath me naache the bakchodi me that was a very nice evening. I could enjoy that because of you man cause I know for sure akela toh nahi hi naachne wala tha mai kisibhi haalat me xD. Thanks for that!! I also remember that ome time you encouraged me to come to the tracks with you foe the runs and made me go for a run in the mornings too. I remember the countless times we turned the lights of our room in the night because seniors were in the wing. I remember those failed attempts at waking people up in the mornimg kust for breakfast. I remember that annoying samsung alarm which used to wake us up for the PE101 sessions. I remember the EDM nights that we attended together and had loads of fun. 
Thank you for all these memories!! All the best for your future!! Love you man!! ",Mahajan Dipak Anil,True,60a3017e819323d199d47e5f,Aditya Singh Rathore

12,"You're lying down in your bed, bringing you hands to your mouth once more to lubricate your penis. You've been masturbating for one hour now, yet you still haven't came and your penis is beginning to absorb your saliva, becoming a sticky, burning hot rod. Furiously, you begin to accelerate your masturbation rapidly. By two hours, your cock is burning in pain yet there is not a single drop of cum - not even precum.

Meanwhile, next door, a girl is masturbating too, on stream, but they can't reach orgasm. In desperation, the girl has resorted to using multiple dildos inside her pussy, but even that is no use. The girl then makes a makeshift sex machine from a dildo and an electric power tool - once again, this is futile. She punches her pillow in defeat.

By three hours, you've given up trying to cum and gone downstairs to watch more anime. However, upon seeing an anime girl fall over and have a panty shot, you feel the need to cum again. Biting your arm to lead the the pain away from your penis, you rapidly masturbate. By four hours, you're screaming as your rough masturbation soon rips the skin cells off your dick. Your cock is now a burning red giant, but there is no cum left - any precum that was there has evaporated.

Meanwhile, the girl screams too - not because of finally reaching orgasm, but because they've gone so long without one that they've resorted to anything. Rapidly pushing the small cactus in and outside of herself, the girl's toe curl on bed sheets as blood flows out from her vaginal entrance. body spasming in pain - but still, she does not orgasm. The world is getting even more desperate.

Suddenly, you get a discord notification from a friend, saying they've been trying to cum to Dream x George fanfiction, but they've ended up making their cock a, quote, ""burning red giant."" Your eyes open in shock horror - it can't be, can it? You rush to the television to ask your waifu how to resolve this mystery when you find that the TV has replaced the anime with an emergency government announcement - there's a new disease preventing orgasms... and its contagious. You feel as if you're about to faint, quickly looking up if there's a cure - there is none. You screech in anger, knowing that your waifu will never love you if you can't pour semen all over a shitty print out of her.

Meanwhile, the girl cries, double fisting her bleeding self as she shrieks in rage, desperate to orgasm. What on Earth can a female do in life if they cannot orgasm? The girl is realising her chatterbate viewers are going down - she needs this orgasm. Realising that there is no hope, she illogically becomes even more desperate, suddenly barging into her brother's room, who is lying naked on the floor, dick ripped off next to a knife; the disease has claimed its first victim. She shoves the dick in her pussy, crying as the lactic acid burns her arm as she rapidly accelerates her brother's dethatched cock in and out, but it's no use: she has the disease.

Suddenly, both of them stop. There's a large siren and a warning appears on the televisions of every house in the world, ""There is no more cum."" The world quickly devolves and you hear a car crash into your house. Out of nowhere, a man grabs you by the neck, desperately shoving his cock in your ass in the need of cum, raping you. Yet, it's no use - the man has the disease, and so do you. Luckily, there's a gun to the side and you manage to pry the discord moderator off, before killing him.

Given a few weeks, society practically doesn't exist - it's like the apocalypse. Crime rates have skyrocketed as people loot dildo shops. The hospitals are beginning to crumble as more and more women show up with more and more exotic accidents. Meanwhile men are being completely taken over by their horniness: a female reporter is stood outside, reporting where the disease was first reported, and you feel the urge. You and the cameraman both turn on her trust, stripping her down and savagely pummelling her, but it's not use - you can not cum. The woman shouts, enraged too, for she can not orgasm either. Children in high school are to scared to go outside and you don't blame them, knowing what sickening lows you may succumb too once this disease truly takes control. Other children, who had already been on discord and thus knew about sex thanks to the moderators, have began spiralling into madness too - high schools have become orgies, with devastating costs to the countries IQ, you think.

Eighty years pass and the human population plummets. Listening to Prokofiev's ""Death of Tybalt"" in your asylum room, you attempt to masturbate one more time. Unbeknownst to you, your the last human on the planet. Entire families have killed each other, each one raping the others corpse, foolishly believing from online sources that necrophilia was the cure. Men and women have killed themselves in spectacular accidents, dying in human crushes as hundreds of orgy-goers suffocate naked. Young teenagers have formed sex cults, praying to bizarre dank memes whilst furiously fucking each other in the hope that somehow, a fucking meme removes the symptoms of a disease. Like you thought, the IQ of the general population has lowered. However, you know better, you know there's no cure so you separated yourself from the idiots, hiding away in this asylum with a few staff who have recently died too... And you still can't cum. Wailing in sadness, you scratch and tear at your cock, wishing it to hell. Eventually, with enough force, you rip your sexual organ clean off and force it into your metal handcuffs.

""What's this?"" You think - it worked. The handcuffs are unlocked. You look outside to the asylum balcony. You can finally escape this petty world. ""How men and women have fallen so far."" You think, ""To go from civil creatures to savage beasts, killing and raping everything in their path."" You shake your head, thinking of the NatGeoWild documentaries you used to watch about savage apes. With a curse to the sky, the disease claims it's last life as the host throws itself off the balcony. Human life is gone and now, the disease has become animal born too. A few thousand years pass and there are no complex life forms at all...

I've always admired how amazing of a person you are - you have a great potential to achieve anything you want (and mujhe lagta jin bhi cheezon me tera motivation rahega wo tu kar bhi lega sab kuch) kaafi wisdom hai but at the same time kaafi childish bhi, kaafi chutiyaape karte rehte but at the same time baki cheeze bhi eventually manage kar hi lete(Damn I have seen you getting A in ESC when you did not even know wtf is an OPAMP the night before. And the best thing was even though itna tight situation tha tu usme bhi kaafi cool tha - log aisi situations me rehte hai toh phat jaati hai bahot gandi tarah se but not you!!)

26,"You're lying down in your bed, bringing you hands to your mouth once more to lubricate your penis. You've been masturbating for one hour now, yet you still haven't came and your penis is beginning to absorb your saliva, becoming a sticky, burning hot rod. Furiously, you begin to accelerate your masturbation rapidly. By two hours, your cock is burning in pain yet there is not a single drop of cum - not even precum.

Meanwhile, next door, a girl is masturbating too, on stream, but they can't reach orgasm. In desperation, the girl has resorted to using multiple dildos inside her pussy, but even that is no use. The girl then makes a makeshift sex machine from a dildo and an electric power tool - once again, this is futile. She punches her pillow in defeat.

By three hours, you've given up trying to cum and gone downstairs to watch more anime. However, upon seeing an anime girl fall over and have a panty shot, you feel the need to cum again. Biting your arm to lead the the pain away from your penis, you rapidly masturbate. By four hours, you're screaming as your rough masturbation soon rips the skin cells off your dick. Your cock is now a burning red giant, but there is no cum left - any precum that was there has evaporated.

Meanwhile, the girl screams too - not because of finally reaching orgasm, but because they've gone so long without one that they've resorted to anything. Rapidly pushing the small cactus in and outside of herself, the girl's toe curl on bed sheets as blood flows out from her vaginal entrance. body spasming in pain - but still, she does not orgasm. The world is getting even more desperate.

Suddenly, you get a discord notification from a friend, saying they've been trying to cum to Dream x George fanfiction, but they've ended up making their cock a, quote, ""burning red giant."" Your eyes open in shock horror - it can't be, can it? You rush to the television to ask your waifu how to resolve this mystery when you find that the TV has replaced the anime with an emergency government announcement - there's a new disease preventing orgasms... and its contagious. You feel as if you're about to faint, quickly looking up if there's a cure - there is none. You screech in anger, knowing that your waifu will never love you if you can't pour semen all over a shitty print out of her.

Meanwhile, the girl cries, double fisting her bleeding self as she shrieks in rage, desperate to orgasm. What on Earth can a female do in life if they cannot orgasm? The girl is realising her chatterbate viewers are going down - she needs this orgasm. Realising that there is no hope, she illogically becomes even more desperate, suddenly barging into her brother's room, who is lying naked on the floor, dick ripped off next to a knife; the disease has claimed its first victim. She shoves the dick in her pussy, crying as the lactic acid burns her arm as she rapidly accelerates her brother's dethatched cock in and out, but it's no use: she has the disease.

Suddenly, both of them stop. There's a large siren and a warning appears on the televisions of every house in the world, ""There is no more cum."" The world quickly devolves and you hear a car crash into your house. Out of nowhere, a man grabs you by the neck, desperately shoving his cock in your ass in the need of cum, raping you. Yet, it's no use - the man has the disease, and so do you. Luckily, there's a gun to the side and you manage to pry the discord moderator off, before killing him.

Given a few weeks, society practically doesn't exist - it's like the apocalypse. Crime rates have skyrocketed as people loot dildo shops. The hospitals are beginning to crumble as more and more women show up with more and more exotic accidents. Meanwhile men are being completely taken over by their horniness: a female reporter is stood outside, reporting where the disease was first reported, and you feel the urge. You and the cameraman both turn on her trust, stripping her down and savagely pummelling her, but it's not use - you can not cum. The woman shouts, enraged too, for she can not orgasm either. Children in high school are to scared to go outside and you don't blame them, knowing what sickening lows you may succumb too once this disease truly takes control. Other children, who had already been on discord and thus knew about sex thanks to the moderators, have began spiralling into madness too - high schools have become orgies, with devastating costs to the countries IQ, you think.

Eighty years pass and the human population plummets. Listening to Prokofiev's ""Death of Tybalt"" in your asylum room, you attempt to masturbate one more time. Unbeknownst to you, your the last human on the planet. Entire families have killed each other, each one raping the others corpse, foolishly believing from online sources that necrophilia was the cure. Men and women have killed themselves in spectacular accidents, dying in human crushes as hundreds of orgy-goers suffocate naked. Young teenagers have formed sex cults, praying to bizarre dank memes whilst furiously fucking each other in the hope that somehow, a fucking meme removes the symptoms of a disease. Like you thought, the IQ of the general population has lowered. However, you know better, you know there's no cure so you separated yourself from the idiots, hiding away in this asylum with a few staff who have recently died too... And you still can't cum. Wailing in sadness, you scratch and tear at your cock, wishing it to hell. Eventually, with enough force, you rip your sexual organ clean off and force it into your metal handcuffs.

""What's this?"" You think - it worked. The handcuffs are unlocked. You look outside to the asylum balcony. You can finally escape this petty world. ""How men and women have fallen so far."" You think, ""To go from civil creatures to savage beasts, killing and raping everything in their path."" You shake your head, thinking of the NatGeoWild documentaries you used to watch about savage apes. With a curse to the sky, the disease claims it's last life as the host throws itself off the balcony. Human life is gone and now, the disease has become animal born too. A few thousand years pass and there are no complex life forms at all...

There's no more cum left on Earth.",Mahajan Dipak Anil,False,60ba19d5659165b3aa644fb2,Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju
27,"There's no way I could express our bond and our memories in few words of a memoir. But kyunki Memoir me kuch toh likhna hai toh here it goes.....
Oniiiii chaan !!! 

Lets start by thanking counselling service jiski vajah se hum dono mil paaye. There's no way two introverts like us, who wouldn't go around socialising with people, could meet each other in this vast world. But we did and it was awesome!! It's just been 2 years(jisme bhi 1 saal online ) but feels like I know you since a very very long time. We had such great times together. There were a lot of highs (literally ) and a lot of lows and we made our way through both of em together. We supported each other in the most crucial times and oh boy was the journey awesome!! 

While I'm writing this memoir, I recall that conversation we had in Goa regarding leaving each other and bruh I just dont feel like we'll ever leave each other ( just to reinforce (;P) ). You were there for me everytime I needed you and I always felt good about it because you're also the best person who can handle me 😜. Thanks for bearing with me all this time. I have learnt a lot of things from you!! 

Regarding the future, brother you know its all going to be okay and things will work out eventually!! And I know it will because I have seen you handle things that are so difficult to handle I have full belief in you that you will eventually figure everything out and make the best out of it. I have never seen a person who cares about ppl more than you do. You'd cross all the levels and overcome all the personal barriers to help other ppl and that's one of the qualities I like the most. 

Sorry for the couple of times I behaved very rudely and hurt you. I don't have any explanation and I know you don't jeed one either. 

Also its okay to commit mistakes sometimes. After seeing you handle very tough situations I had this image that this guy is a perfect person - has the purest soul and a will to help ppl so strong that he'll always help people. And it is true!! But you committing a mistake sometimes gives me hope - it tells me even a person as good as digu can commit mistakes - its a very human nature to commit mistakes and no one is perfect. But do know this brother you might not be the moon on the fill- moon day but you're the ""chaudavin ka chaand"" sorta - who may not be perfect but is closest among everyone else to being perfect!! 

What are you doing with life ? you're lifting spirits up of many people - many lonely people who would not approach anyone else for help although they should and they know they should. You've shown me there's a good and soft side to everyone and no person is evil and I cant forget that ever. You're someone I want to be like in terms of hooman affairs and I think enough time ke saath ho bhi jaau shayad. Thanks for giving me this hope ☺️. 

Lmao a couple of months ago we were so clean in terms of bad habits and kya bakchod geera hai graph uske baad se!! I really hope we meet sooooner and get to do all that pending stuff!! If there is one thing I will forever be grateful for then that'd be meeting you!! Meeting you has been the been the best thing that has happened in my life till now and for some reason I think it will stay at that position forever. Don't know if I will find anything better after I have met you. I wouldn't mind going to the other world(heaven/ hell although pretty sure hum dono hell me hi jayenge saath me) after this bro!! And this reminds me of a couplet from a very famous ghazal of faiz ahmed faiz ( hehe iske naam pe jokes baadme) - 
मक़ाम 'फ़ैज़' कोई राह में जचा ही नहीं 
जो कू-ए-यार से निकले तो सू-ए-दार चले !! 

Damn mai kitna bhi likhlu aur 1000 cheeze hai jo tumse kehna chahunga but isme nai keh paaunga shayad!! Toh ig ab tk ke liye itna hi !! Baki bro milte hai jald hi bakchodi karte hai mast! Lots and lots of love to you!! 😘

Bhai bahot si memories judi hai yaar tumhare saath!! Regarding the night when the third yearites caught us, I too felt the same way lol!! I was shit scared what would happen and shayad mere chehre se dikh bhi rha hoga but still it was a fun night. Do know that I was looking forward to dance to rocky/disco song and certainly not a slow arijit singh song 😛. I had spent two years of my life in kota away from my home but somehow in the initial days i was still feeling a bit homesick. This was in the very beginning of the orientation and I didn't know kaise logon se milunga and kya hoga aage. But you did a very good job on distracting me from these thoughts of homesickness and making me focus on the fun part of college life instead. I will never forget the roasts of the people( mostly tamonud and divyanshu ). Tum kaafi mazedaar insaan ho bhai!! Gaana gaa lete ho, poems likh lete ho, bakchod writing skills, mathematics strong hai, basketball khel lete jo itna bakchod, funny ho kaafi(ngl I still laugh at the story of 'kiski **** me kitne **** aaj ginega deepak **** sometimes). Thanks for all these memories!! I really cant keep a track but there are lots of memories and I thank you for that!! 
Thanks for being there bruh. I have always been admiring you and there were times when you just made me forget about the hard part of life with your hilarious joles and roasts.

76,"You're lying down in your bed, bringing you hands to your mouth once more to lubricate your penis. You've been masturbating for one hour now, yet you still haven't came and your penis is beginning to absorb your saliva, becoming a sticky, burning hot rod. Furiously, you begin to accelerate your masturbation rapidly. By two hours, your cock is burning in pain yet there is not a single drop of cum - not even precum.

Meanwhile, next door, a girl is masturbating too, on stream, but they can't reach orgasm. In desperation, the girl has resorted to using multiple dildos inside her pussy, but even that is no use. The girl then makes a makeshift sex machine from a dildo and an electric power tool - once again, this is futile. She punches her pillow in defeat.

By three hours, you've given up trying to cum and gone downstairs to watch more anime. However, upon seeing an anime girl fall over and have a panty shot, you feel the need to cum again. Biting your arm to lead the the pain away from your penis, you rapidly masturbate. By four hours, you're screaming as your rough masturbation soon rips the skin cells off your dick. Your cock is now a burning red giant, but there is no cum left - any precum that was there has evaporated.

Meanwhile, the girl screams too - not because of finally reaching orgasm, but because they've gone so long without one that they've resorted to anything. Rapidly pushing the small cactus in and outside of herself, the girl's toe curl on bed sheets as blood flows out from her vaginal entrance. body spasming in pain - but still, she does not orgasm. The world is getting even more desperate.

Suddenly, you get a discord notification from a friend, saying they've been trying to cum to Dream x George fanfiction, but they've ended up making their cock a, quote, ""burning red giant."" Your eyes open in shock horror - it can't be, can it? You rush to the television to ask your waifu how to resolve this mystery when you find that the TV has replaced the anime with an emergency government announcement - there's a new disease preventing orgasms... and its contagious. You feel as if you're about to faint, quickly looking up if there's a cure - there is none. You screech in anger, knowing that your waifu will never love you if you can't pour semen all over a shitty print out of her.

Meanwhile, the girl cries, double fisting her bleeding self as she shrieks in rage, desperate to orgasm. What on Earth can a female do in life if they cannot orgasm? The girl is realising her chatterbate viewers are going down - she needs this orgasm. Realising that there is no hope, she illogically becomes even more desperate, suddenly barging into her brother's room, who is lying naked on the floor, dick ripped off next to a knife; the disease has claimed its first victim. She shoves the dick in her pussy, crying as the lactic acid burns her arm as she rapidly accelerates her brother's dethatched cock in and out, but it's no use: she has the disease.

Suddenly, both of them stop. There's a large siren and a warning appears on the televisions of every house in the world, ""There is no more cum."" The world quickly devolves and you hear a car crash into your house. Out of nowhere, a man grabs you by the neck, desperately shoving his cock in your ass in the need of cum, raping you. Yet, it's no use - the man has the disease, and so do you. Luckily, there's a gun to the side and you manage to pry the discord moderator off, before killing him.

Given a few weeks, society practically doesn't exist - it's like the apocalypse. Crime rates have skyrocketed as people loot dildo shops. The hospitals are beginning to crumble as more and more women show up with more and more exotic accidents. Meanwhile men are being completely taken over by their horniness: a female reporter is stood outside, reporting where the disease was first reported, and you feel the urge. You and the cameraman both turn on her trust, stripping her down and savagely pummelling her, but it's not use - you can not cum. The woman shouts, enraged too, for she can not orgasm either. Children in high school are to scared to go outside and you don't blame them, knowing what sickening lows you may succumb too once this disease truly takes control. Other children, who had already been on discord and thus knew about sex thanks to the moderators, have began spiralling into madness too - high schools have become orgies, with devastating costs to the countries IQ, you think.

Eighty years pass and the human population plummets. Listening to Prokofiev's ""Death of Tybalt"" in your asylum room, you attempt to masturbate one more time. Unbeknownst to you, your the last human on the planet. Entire families have killed each other, each one raping the others corpse, foolishly believing from online sources that necrophilia was the cure. Men and women have killed themselves in spectacular accidents, dying in human crushes as hundreds of orgy-goers suffocate naked. Young teenagers have formed sex cults, praying to bizarre dank memes whilst furiously fucking each other in the hope that somehow, a fucking meme removes the symptoms of a disease. Like you thought, the IQ of the general population has lowered. However, you know better, you know there's no cure so you separated yourself from the idiots, hiding away in this asylum with a few staff who have recently died too... And you still can't cum. Wailing in sadness, you scratch and tear at your cock, wishing it to hell. Eventually, with enough force, you rip your sexual organ clean off and force it into your metal handcuffs.

""What's this?"" You think - it worked. The handcuffs are unlocked. You look outside to the asylum balcony. You can finally escape this petty world. ""How men and women have fallen so far."" You think, ""To go from civil creatures to savage beasts, killing and raping everything in their path."" You shake your head, thinking of the NatGeoWild documentaries you used to watch about savage apes. With a curse to the sky, the disease claims it's last life as the host throws itself off the balcony. Human life is gone and now, the disease has become animal born too. A few thousand years pass and there are no complex life forms at all...

I always admired you for the level of hardwork that you put into things and I really feel it is your best quality. There is one thing however that I think you should know and it is that you are an extra ordinary person bruh. You may not believe it at times and think that you are just an ordinary guy who would not be able to do much but I know you're not. You're awesome!! Itna sab kuch karke bhi FB stories me positivity failaate ho logon me. You surely lift up spirits too!! There were times when I was not feeling good but you were there - sharing wholesome memes, laughing at the silly jokes that I used to slip in between and yet helping me out in academics at the same time. Thanks for that, thanks for existing. I cant imagine what would have been my situation in some of the courses if you were not there. I love how you also have a similar taste in music and also the feel good memes and the literature as well!! Baki bro mai tumhe kya time management sikhau tum khud itni saari cheeze manage karte ho- you are really breathtaking. I was not really a nightout wala guy in the first year. But when I met you in 4th sem and saw you just flipping the side of the match just through nights -  i was really motivated ( lmao you did a DS assignment once throughout the night and I was really awestruck. I thought ye bande ka ye assignment toh gaya time hi nai bacha hai and there were you!! Damn it was the first time I saw someone do that tbh and later on tumhare saath reh reh ke mai wo bhi sikh gaya) . I do not have much words how to thank you and I can not yet imagine what would the journey look like without you in it., Because seriously, you were there with me in the darkest semester - I remember all the nightouts and countless deadlines and the scary nights of OS. You were there all the times and you helped me get through it. Thanks a lot. Baki bro, milte hai Noida me Party karenge saath me and bakchodiya karenge aur bhi!!

Ironically, the very first line of this memoir compares you with other people but okay. you are really a very awesome person and I am grateful that I got a chance to meet you in my life. I remember we met for the first time in first year summers lol. It was the phy103 AM thingy on which we worked together. I hate that we did not get to hang out in the last month of iitk.

ye memoir me kya hi likhu ab samajh nai aa rha. Jab bhi kuch kehna hota hai tumse mai toh seedha keh deta hu tumhe dont think aisa kuch hoga jo nahi keh paaya hounga. Thanks for giving me that space and trusting me at the same time. I remember that one time when you sensed that I might be overthinking things and might be in the guilt that I have messed up things. You knew I might be hurting myself just by overthinking on that and you sent me the most comforting text one could possibly send at that time. tbh I was really really scared at that time and you helped me. Life is weird no? Sometimes we help people and we think that it is a very small thing for us but it really means a lot to them. Thanks for that. Well this was just one incident, I think there a lot more incidents where you helped me when I wasn't doing okay, Even lockdown ke time me you were one of the very few people jinse meri har roz baat hoti thi and I think uska reason bhi obvious hai. You end up where you find most comfortable.  Thanks for existing. Thanks for everything. I will never forget the antaragni nights when we scrolled tinder together, the nights in sixth semester when we bonded and opened up to each other, that one whole night when we shared the gossips, the days when we planned out things together, the last night when you gave me that letter and other countless occasions. It was a very wonderful journey. A journey holistic journey in fact. I really enjoyed the journey and I hope you enjoyed it too!! Thanks for making it special. You are one of the few people I go to whenever I do not feel good and yet everytime you make me feel great about myself. Thanks for existing. I really hope we get to meet soon and complete all the pending pawris. All the best!!
