65,"So Aero it is. Things were quite fun just because of some enthusiastic people like you in dept. Chota sa dept. was just like another set of closely bonded group. I think we are the only dept. to attempt a mass bunk and were more or less successful in it 😂. The labs were quite memorable; the funny stuff we did, the TA one was lit. From keeping the chat group active to writing happy teachers day on board to organizing group photos to maintain discord servers and ccd treats from profs., it counts on you. Thanks for keeping and spreading that energy. And I really felt you someone serious about music when I got to know about your albums and anime stuff. Awaiting to see you at greater heights! The ending could always have been better. So, Hey! let's organize a meet for everyone, at least virtually. Stay connected, might need you to develop some music stuff that was pending 😉.

For some reason; whatever I remember of our memories, we are both smiling in it. It seems like kafi resonate karte the thoughts. It was a privilege to be with you be it Hall12, SnT or Aero. Yaar apna pura ka pura dept. hai mast tha. We'll cath it up someday when'll meet. We definitely will. And haan, will try to stay in core 😉. Let's defy gravity and fly high! and meet above the zenith!

69,"So Raghav sir. The story starts sitting in that VKR benches and bitching along with Ankit bhaiya. You were the first known face that I met after coming to Hall12 on day-1. Didn't interact a lot post campus but kafi cheeze apne hi sikhayi thi pre-IITK. Who knows, if that hadn't been the case might not have been here writing this memoir. But apart from it; you were just amazing in your attitude, chapuness, and personality. Keep it up and stay in loop.",Mataria Pence Jagatkumar,True,60c107ad659165b3aa6452ef,Raghav  Singh

And wherever the team is today, you have been a crucial foundation in it. Those debugging nights and Bitching seniors. Just amazing.

Definitely, Aero mein sab mas the yaar. It was a beautiful little department just because of people like you. Quite a synergy. Last moment assignments exams ka sath baith ke samajna, all those are a great dose of nostalgia. But I guess we met before that, during Udghosh marketing. I know you since then. And we all have lots of karmas to be balanced for you, so please stay in touch. We are just a text away. ",Mataria Pence Jagatkumar,True,60c10f08659165b3aa645323,Sanket  Gaggar

In this fake world, where people just make baseless claims, someone ""real"" like you can be a motivation. You are what an ideal being should be. Sound in skills, humble in nature, no faltu bakwas just real solid results, friendly, ethical, and all this rooted to the ground. One big achievement of being associate head was to meet you closely. It was no less than a privilege. Please stay in touch and nurture/pass on all your good qualities.

83,"Arey Sir! We knew each other casually before campus. But then, you were out of my league, somewhere very high. Thanks for the opportunity that we once again met and worked with real dedication here. Udghosh played a huge role, you see. It gave all the required mental fuel, using which we propelled ourselves in whatever we do today. And that too working with you felt like a real team. I doubt my dedication if you had not been there with me. Cheers to that. Looking forward to stay in loop with you ahead. Bhulna mat!

85,Arey Sir! That's how we greet whenever we met. I always admired you on how you managed multiple things at the same time and excelled in all.
