What an amazing summer we had. Summer-Camp was fun with you, so was playing volleyball and so was discussing football and life in general.  That Champions league final we went to watch in OAT and you were wearing your Real jersey,  was a very special experience. Unfortunately, things did not pan out as you would have planned and through that difficult phase, its actually commendable how to picked yourself up again. I know I may not have been best of the friends during that time, but I cared and when I look back on it, I think I should have done more and we should have spent some more time together. FIFA match to jarur khelenge ek din. Until then, good luck with everything and take care. You are a very humble person, stay that way and stay in touch.

First year trip manali trip se malana cream partner. BC kya headers leta tha tu Bayern se bc full cross spamming FIFA and basketball in the last days was kaafi fun. Lucknow trip toh alag hi chapter hai poora. 'Chill maar' ko actual justice tu karta hai. Baaki, AVALON wali hookah night Maqbool ke paas toh yaad rahegi. 
Banate hai plan phir jald hi next trip ka. All the best and take care

Sath Bakchodi karte karte 4 saal nikal gye bhai. First year trip destination decide karne se baat shuru hui phir kabhi ruki hi nhi. BC kahan le gye the kebab khilane. Between ""capacity badhani hai"" and "" bhai ek aur banao"" you grew up. Tumhari bakchodi ke charche toh hai hi campus mai. Lucknow trips ke dhanyavad. Yadu ko gariyane ke liye dhanyavad. Exist karne ke liye dhanyavad. Second year summers ka time bhi behatreen tha. Aur wo Akhiri party ka toh koi jawab hi nhi hai. Ek aur saal hai, Good luck and take care.

Agle mahine Spiti onn hai!

Saale first year mai tere maghne ke kisse the campus mai. Bhai wo 3rd year galaxy ka video shoot toh kya hi tha, thanks for being a loyal right hand and phir campus mai aakhiri wali bakchodi.

ART105 was the beginning and what a fun time it was! Kuch bhi shot karne lag jaate the. Reunion Mocha outing bhi sahi this, kya pel ke khaya tha apan ne. Thank you for the daily dose for dank content and for a being support who I can always count on. We did not spent much time together, but whenever we did it was a reminder that we need to do this more often. Baaki treks ka silsila toh barkarar rahega, hopefully there sath bhi. Bangalore wali party toh onn hai hi. Last hangout was special too aur bc agle din tu positive aa gyi thi. Good luck with everything and  stay a crazy ass that you are.

Not a single day of campus life can be summarised without you. Probably one of those very few guys who would know 'almost' all of my secrets. Day 1 se lekar 'aakhiri shaam' in the campus we have grown immensely together. There couldn't have been a better closure.  Those random long talks in the midnight, playing MM and PUBG were awesome indeed. Kabhi nahi Socha tha ki I'll go along so well with someone jiske aur mere interests itne different honge. My go to ranting partner. Thank you being constant support throughout. BC exam ke pehle hi saari TVs kyon dekhni hoti thi tujhe. 
BC kabhi kabhi dusro ki baat bhi maan jaaya kar, toh tu bhi ek aur bakchod trip ka part hota!
UPSC ke liye all the best and I'd hope ki IIMA ki jarurat na pade.

Baaki toh, volleyball sath khelna kaafi sahi tha and kaafi acchha khelta hai tu  aur full efforts daalta hai. One of those few people on campus who have their priorities straight about how they want to carry themselves. I know for a fact you re going to go places for many reasons.

Volleyball ka ek bhi pratice session ya match aisa nhi tha jab tu sath nhi tha. Bhai, apna dynamic kuch alag hi tha shuru see hi alag level pe connect ho gye the. Inter-IIT mai kaafi sahi memories thi but kaafi regret rahega ki itni bakchod team ke baad bhi medal nhi aaya, Kaafi depressing time tha wo bhi and jab hamara game peak pe aaya toh Inter--IIT cancel ho gya. 
Bhai maine terese jyada excited londa nhi dekha kisi bhi cheez ke liye. Bhai wo Bhubaneshwar mai Random ladkiyon ko roses dena was epic.
