Hum dono ne kitne course saath kiye, itne to same branch wale bhi nahi karte😂, wo fluid ke prof ko galiyana, thermo me bore hono, ya fir tutorial wale prof ka kisi bhi student ko register bana dena (“Tumhe to college se nikal dena  chahiye”🤣🤣), bioelectricity ki late night class ho ya recent wali chem ki class. Hum logo ne bhaut maze kare.I still wonder how many countries your parents have visited? JustKidding😜😜
Antaragni ki nights, summer ka gym, ho ya first year ka PUBG bhaut yaad ayega, or yaad aaoge tum. Good luck for the corporate life, and haan jaldi milte hai!!

1,"Adi, Aladin, Adi fu.. I don’t even know how many names I called you with, and you always replied with a smile (mf always smiling). 
For the whole first year, I loved how you had always told me and Deepak “Sone Do Yaar,” the famous quote.And, I am always thankful for the side bed in the room.
I will never forget the sociology betrayal, kya katta tha mera..😂😂, how hard you worked in the TA lab for the project😁. And It always amazed me how sharp your eyesight was during the walk or how big the data center you were, and how a person can be so photogenic. 
But I seriously enjoyed the time we spent together, the hall 12 dinner, the Ganga beraj trip, the BBQ parties, the dark chocolate guilt. We shared some beautiful memories during the time we spent in the gym, the movies we watched, or the kabhi-kabhi wali library. 
You went from confused Adi to Job wala Adi. Congrats on the Job and for your grahasti 😜(You are the only one among us).🤞

5,"You were the first BJ I ever got😂😂, PUBG wala BJ, Class me sone wala BJ, Deepak ko galiyane wala BJ, my third roommate in summer wala BJ. I was going to miss you. All the best for your life!!",Shubham,True,60a65d8a819323d199d48f00,Bhavjeet  Singh
6,"When I arrived at the campus, and we were standing  in a queue, I saw a person standing there and cramping a paragraph in high-top supra. He was you; you were the first person who told me what “kholna” is.

On the same day, I saw the same person in the quad with the bushes and pillars😂; you were the one out of all us brothers who never felt any fear in doing no matter what seniors told us what to do. Whether it was late-night senior interaction or the legendry Dhawal-Mahajan duo performance at the canteen, the way you tackle every situation was extraordinary; you were indeed a free spirit.

You made my stay at the college a lot of fun, the “Deepak Lal…” joke, the endless roasting session, shouting (you know what) in the corridor, the late-night walks, the hall 12 dinner, the machine wali coffee, last time BBQ plans, OAT rooftop talks, bullying Adi 🤣.
I was always impressed by your money-making ideas, whether it was splitting Rajan's billion dollars or the “mach city investment theory.” 

The last two months were a lot of fun, the photoshoots, the walks, the dinner session, roasting side wali wing, and all the good quality time we spent. A gentle reminder, you still haven’t paid me for those photoshoots😂.

Good luck 👍 for coming life; let’s chase our dreams, and meet you in the City of Angles. 🤞

8,"The first thing came in my mind when I think about you is,”Chota bacha samajh ke koi aankh dikhana re”, bhaut maja aaya yaar tere saath, vo first year ka interaction (Pet ka drum banana), ya fir chm ki lab ka timepass, Dipak ke maje lena bhaut acche the vo din. 
You never gave a shit about how people think about you or your action, you were the true free spirit, chahe vo CC me blanket leke jana ho, corridor me soke net chalana ho,ya fir posture sahi karne ki belt.
Tumhare cosmos ki knowledge aur full proof stats (Har ghar ke samne ek … hai) ke to hum diwane the😜, aur ESC me variables ke naam ka to kya kahna (int hathi, ghoda). Kisi ke maje lene ho to tum sabse aage rahe, Tomanued, Dhruv, Bhavjeet, Ravi sabhi tumhara sikaar bane.
Vo BBQ treats, tumhara mujhe aur adi ko galaxy me katna(Galaxy Parade), mess me timepass bhaut yaad aayega.
Aise hi bane rehna,Aur first year me har senior se bachane ke liye dhanywad.👍👍👍🤞

9,"You were the first friend in college. And the journey of being the first friend to roommates for three fucking long years was something else.

I never knew you were such an animal person. Chahe you OAT ka kutta jo tumhare perfume ka diwana tha, ya fir wo jo dophar me  bed ke neeche betha rehta tha. That lizard jisne tumhari subh ki neend kharab kari thi ya Dh**v jisne hamare do sem kharab kare😂(Sorry a certain y17 roll ***248).

Life with you was full of adventures, wo first year me cycle pe ghumna, ya fir subh uth ke MT ya doaa canteen jana, ho ya fir adi (SONE DO YAAR) ke bed ko Table Tennis Table me convert karna. Or those long summer PUBG sessions. ACA ka project, ho ya batti ka, ya fir freshers ki practice me fraud maarna we were everywhere. Or the most depressing  late night movie session (Varun Dicaprio’s OCTOBER🤣 ). Aur chahe fluid ya fir thermo ki class.
The way one of us say “Chal raha hai” aur hum pahunch jate khane, chahe wo canteen(especially tha French cuisine: Bread Potato) ho ya 3am kathi roll we were something else.
Definitely going to miss your EDM night moves, or thooming on ""sone pari"" song.or that VR experience.

From being strangers to friends and friends to family, you made that college feel more like home. Thank you so much. 
You're the best roommate I could ever have!!. And definitely  going to meet you soon.🤞

Tab tk ke liye,tum bhi  savdhan rho ,surakshit rho, aur satark raho!!  Jay hind!!

12,"Raju bada hi natkhat,……jhatpat, this rhyme always comes to my mind when I think about you—or annoying you by saying,” When are you going to suicide, Raju?”.
Whatever time we spent together, I enjoyed it; whether it was the long night walks (“Itna tej kyu chalte ho🤣”), or the One time when cat clawed you, you still owe me for saving your life; otherwise, for Adi, you were long gone😜. Roasting Tomu, watching the movie were some fun memories.
The last few months were a lot of fun; the photoshoots, the few exercise sessions, the endless anime discussions, surviving Dhawal investment talks (5crore and mach city😁), coming up with a yearbook bio or some serious discussions made those days memorable. And always remember, I am coming for those 300 million dollars😂.
Thanks for being a good friend. Good luck in life, and let's meet soon. 🤞
