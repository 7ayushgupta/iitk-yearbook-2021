What do you eat every morning that you are so damn energetic! I have enjoyed our swing conversations and midnight strolls a lot.
You are an amazing artist, and I still have that Rick and Morty mini-painting you drew for me. FYI, I also have your ‘Haaye Huku Haaye’ video and thanks for reviving the ‘Basanti’ video every year -_- 
Stay the same and take care  <3",Pratigya  Tomar,True,60a5528a819323d199d48543,Akshay
1,"Hey Archit!
Still remember meeting you for the first time in our TA meeting, you give off very intellectual vibes. Can’t think of anyone else who is more of a ‘Krishna Janamashthi’ enthusiast, lol. Thanks for bearing me during the TA labs and for being so nice and genuine. 
Wishing you all the best for your future <3

2,"Zuzuuu!
Only rarely do you meet people for a brief amount of time and become so fond of them. Your reactions literally make my day, your savage responses and your laziness. When the rest of the campus was busy cramming during exams, you would literally watch movies because you were always prepared (Except the 8th sem LOL)!! I will always remember 'The Night you guys went to RM and the after events'.
Anyhow, Stay sassy and take care <3

Met you 4 years ago, and one inferno/mid sem later, we were practically inseparable. Our friendship is an epic one, from helping you send texts/replies, to us sending risqué texts together, from me explaining you kinky stuff to you explaining me ‘GM’, from me annoying you by being super chatty to now you joining and suggesting weird things to do together. Our journey made you open and, it kept me grounded. You have brightened my life with your positivity and kindness.
The best roommate I could ever have had. My partner in crime. Thank you for always listening to me and making me feel comfortable, for dancing and singing your heart out with me, also for bringing Soya Sticks but most importantly, for being lazy, crazy and weird with me. Always remember I am just one text/call away, no matter where we go or what we do. 
The Stock the Stock event, The crime room, Late-night conversations, Game Nights, planning photoshoots, making reels, making graffiti, the sleepovers, the Polaroids, and so much more. It was WHOLESOME!!
Life is a circle. I started my IITK journey with you and Ritika at GHT, you being my roommate, and ended it the same way at GH, and for that, I am eternally grateful. Love You<3
PS: Let’s keep influenzzing!!

We have been lab partners from the 3rd semester till the very end. I still remember the weird things we have done and the fraud in almost every lab xD. Thanks to you, my Aero experience was beautiful; it literally would be impossible without you. From selecting courses to homework to lab reports to Matlab assignments, we have been through everything together. 
And obviously can’t forget to mention the stellar performance you gave in the galaxy video, lol. Honestly, I love how you are always so calm and how you came to me bid me bye. Will miss our gossips. Till we meet again, stay awesome and skinny (If you want) :P

6,"Hey TA202 CAD partner xD
It was so much fun being in the same group as you. Doing CAD together was delightful, also adventurous. I remember our last hangout at CCD. It was amazing. I also remember being influenced by you to join Squash because it sounded such a cool sport. Anyhow, TA202 lab was stressful but fun because of our group.
I wish you all the best for your future ahead <3

Cheers to the great conversations, delicious meals and the midnight walks we have had on campus. Our first meeting was epic and will remain a secret xD

It was so much fun to do the photoshoot with you; you would always give your inputs and bring in the pizzazz. Thank you for your positivity and those amazing and interesting stories (more like gossips). Also, for the Gutthi meme, lol.
Stay the way you are, always!

You have always worked hard, be it academically or sports-wise. From waking up early at 6 for conditioning camp to waking me up for summer camp, you have been very diligent. I remember you calling me on my birthday last year at midnight and like I have said, it meant a lot to me. 
Be as awesome as you are. Let’s keep in touch. Till then, all the very best for everything <3

I still have that picture we took at the airstrip as freshers (Pink shirt wali!). I also remember hosting the Game Section with you on Fresher’s night. Man, did we have fun that night! Endless gossips, rant sessions, going for classes together, breakfast sessions. Thank you for always sharing your notes and helping me prepare for exams/quizzes with sincerity and as much as you could. Thank you for making Aero fun for me.
I hope you will always stay as fun and sweet as you are. Keep brightening people’s lives with your positivity and craziness.
Hope to you see soon too. Till then, all the best and Lots of Love <3

To the most fluid human ever, who would do whatever others would ask to (Angrez!). Love the summer of 2018 because I made such amazing friends in the summer camp. I have always enjoyed having night strolls with you, randomly chatting, having fun during those crazy game nights or going out with the baddy group. Even if we didn’t meet every day, we would still act crazy around each other and have a blast; I could be my goofy self and be so comfortable around you all. 
Sadly, we couldn’t perform a duet in DE ever hope we could just dance around the next time we ever meet. Anyhow, cheers to all the good times and hoping we would make new memories. Let’s plan a tripppp na :p
PS: Still wouldn’t forget how you hid certain things from us -_-

I distinctly remember our first and last meet on the campus. First was in the hostel to ask where we were basically from and, our last meet was in the mess.
Wish we had talked more but anyhow, I hope the best for you. All the best for everything buddy <3

I remember meeting you for the first time in Auditorium, and boy was I beyond happy when I found that you would be my partner in PHY101. Can never forget how much we used to gossip/chat during that one hour and how much chutiyaap we basically did. Remember that collision of equipment in the momentum experiment, lol! Cannot forget to mention how much you would help me with academics at times and our strolls, where we would talk about everything from crushes to academic stress. Thank you for that. 
You made my first year so much bearable and, I have always loved how you would sometimes randomly call me to gossip/bitch/chat. We should do that more. Anyhow, hope to meet you, till then all the best for Zindagi buddy <3

You are someone I can always laugh with; even at my worst, I am my best self with you. We have cried in front of each other, been a wreck together, and chatted for hours together. You have always supported me, reassured me when I was feeling low, cheered for me and have accepted all my flaws and, so have I. You like someone because of their qualities but you love someone DESPITE all their qualities, and you, Ritika, have my heart. 
Thank you for always comforting me, joining me in craziness but above all for teaching me weird slang (Chakku, Dhoti etc!) and bringing Satu<3!! Thank you for being the Monica to my Rachel. Always remember, “I’ll be there for you!”
Our late-night conversations, long phone calls, Rooftop Adventures, doing your make-up, clicking a thousand pictures together, making graffiti and so much more. It was all BEAUTIFUL!
Life is indeed a full circle. I started my IITK journey with you and Priyal at GHT, you being my ultimate bulla partner, and ended it the same way at GH, for that, I am eternally grateful. Love You<3

‘Bihar ka amir aadmi’. If ‘nautanki’ was a person, it would be you, literally!
The best thing that came out of summer camp’18 was our baddy group. It is literally a gift to be able to talk as much as you do (nonsense mostly, but okay :P). In all honestly, you make everyone laugh a lot and are so easy to talk to. Can never forget how you took me late to my own birthday celebration, our mini but amazing trips to Blue World and Lucknow. Cheers to all the fun times during fests, random game nights or while eating delicious meals together with the baddy group. Let’s make a trip plan and try to make it successful this time ;P
Hope to meet you soon in Noida, take care<3
