I always blame the structure of CS for being the reason for keeping away such great members from me. Bhai kaafi zyaada log hai jinse acchi baat nahi hopaayi :(. Yaar sweet toh tum ho par phir bhi tum Goa nahi aaye toh I'll take your praises now.

Kaafi baatein karni hai tumse. Cheezei jo jaanni hai and persepectives jo explore karni hai about every other thing that life has to offer. Yaar. Par it's ok ig. It's not the end when there are things that remain :P. Ig we will meet sometime soon. Hamara bhi dheerese ek close-knit group banta hua dikh raha tbh XD. When we'll meet and have fun, ig all this will be worth it.

Man you have been the most relatable person in the campus. Funny how Dipuk once aptly said that we are birds of the same feather (something in those lines, idk). Bhai tumse kaafi baatein kari lol. Talking to you somehow kept me sound. Continue to be the person that you are man, you really helped me, and I know that you will go onto help many.

Lol, I still can't get over those mama mio walks XD. Mast intoxication tha ye toh XD. Bhai aise hi mast aadmi raho tum, Russian gals ko patao, comrades banao, China ko nuke kardo(?). Thanks for giving me the space to be vulnerable, thanks for helping me come out of it.

Am sorry, I know you don't like this XD.

Bhai kahase shuru karu? The three-hour-long discussion (behas) that we had on that night? The unexpected encounter with that professor? The fraud-ing that we did in our summer projects? How benevolently you tried to teach me on that endsem, at the cost of your preparation? How we tried to eat up all the syllabus together a few days before they happened? How you tried to motivate me with all your might when you had much to deal with in your life too? How you helped me find a nuanced interest in philosophy with our discussions with clashing PoVs?

Man yes. All this is still a part of me. Still fresh and wondering how it has been so long since all of this happened. You were great to be with and to learn from. I wish we could have had more time (not that we had less time, but any discussion with you seems endless even now).

There still are things that I still couldn't thank you for and things for which I couldn't say that I'm sorry. A lot comes to my mind when I think about you. The person who, even though, had a chance to find a better company on a happening Antaragni night, yet stuck to my lazy, lonely ass, which did not do much to help you out in that post. The person who is way more passionate and ideas so revolutionary that they were sometimes ahead of time? The person who helped push the team forward? The person who truly had a mission and vision that he strived for? At times you inspired me to work a lot harder, man!

I wish we could have still been in touch to have talked with you when I was a bit more mature enough to do so. From the many bags of sorries to pick from, I'd like to apologize for that one time when I blatantly ignored a particular case that you brought up to me just because the higher-ups were dealing with it, and you had to take it up. You are a man of action. You truly are.

I hope you continue to tread the path of being an individual who truly cares about others and does things to help them.

Continue to be as kind-hearted as you are, be the brave one you are, for this helps the shit that I am, lol. Thanks to all those shitty times lately, I got to know how much you cared for me and helped me rise above my situations. You gave me strength, all the while when you were going in shitty phases. It means a lot.

From knowing that you are a black box to understanding the pain that it hides with all the happiness that it derives from the walks of life, it has been an incredible journey.

2. you did not accept that coordie proposal.

Thanks, man, for all those supporting times. Getting validated by you helped me a lot. And uss raat ki bakchodi mai bhi! You still were the same!

Here's to you and hoping that you become even more of a great individual you are!",Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju,True,60c10738659165b3aa6452eb,Somesh  Bajpai

Here's to you and your bright future!",Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju,True,60c23fdf659165b3aa645c89,Sparsh  Kaoshik
46,"Man, I was initially worried about the trip. But bhai tum dono ke bina itna maza nahi ho paata. One of the best parts of the trip was knowing you two! Be it that night of Social Humour or our way back from Sagnik's cocktail disaster, it all was fun, truly fun! Wish we could have had more laughs and time together (another trip?).

P.S.: Turned out Hookah harms too. Lungs barbaad BC;-;

47,"Bhai after reading your memoir, laga ki kaafi ganda insaan hu mai! Reason keliye dekhiye agla episode of CID.

You really are a tear-jerker now, man. Anyway, thanks for always caring for me. I still remember how you helped me out even on your birthday and taught me some stuff right before the lab exam. Kuch yaad nahi tha BC par XD. You made my life easier! We had our own highs and lows, faults and pluses, and ig somehow, we made up for each other, meanwhile learning and inspiring from one another. Now I know that I have you to catch me if I ever fall. Kaafi different hai ham, but at the same time kaafi similar, ever felt that?

I've not been a great person to deal with later on, somehow you people managed to bear with XD. Thanks for that! Thanks for every gaali that you give aajkal, mera only source ho tum please don't stop XD.

Bhai woh kaha philosophical walks thi, bas Dipuk was overestimating me (as always) XD. Bhai you also owe for not spending much time in the last few days too, toh ha you better take up the workcation ki responsibility, also you're better at logistics so... XD. Bhai tumhare bina kaafi cheezei possible nahi hoti, and you are the person who was always there to clean the shitty scenarios that we created XD.

Bhai bahut baatei hai jo tumse karni hai, bahut cheezei jo bolni hai, bahut cheezei jo jaanni hai. Ig ye sab abb Bengaluru mai? Yaha thodi likhunga mai ye sab? :P Bhai zindagi mai toh accha karoge, aur woh mai paas se dekhung toh all the best kyu bolu? I'll just say that I miss you a lot and wish that we could still have had some more time (matlab itna time bhi sufficient nahi tha XD).

I love you <3

P.S.: Just for the record, you deserve all the love that this world has to offer.
P.P.S.: Remember what I told Dipuk tere barei mai? :P",Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju,True,60c24714659165b3aa645dce,Tanishq  Patil

Enduku anthala dobbuthav :(((. Sarle, inkenti vishayalu mari? Man, you are one of the most awesome people from our batch, continue to stay like the funny one that you are! Inka tarvata elago baaga munduku veltav! All the best for that too!

Take care man!",Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju,False,60c2410a659165b3aa645cc4,Vutnoori  Vamshi
49,"The first time I ever heard about you was from Harish. Was saying how smort you are. And then Dipuk came along with his Legends of Yash Maheshwari. Same cheezei with a bit more information on wholesomeness, weeb shiz, etc. Respect Meter: Stonks. The minimal interactions in the messenger group only reinforced the tales that I heard.

I hope we meet, and I hope we vibe someday. Until then, chaapte hi rahoge ig bolneki kya baat hai.

52,"Yooooo

It has been a long time since our first convo on that sofa. Damn how the things have evolved from thereon. From me being shy, introverted, and scared to being shy, introverted, and not so scared, you encouraged me to come out of my shell. Having our ups and downs made the journey even more unique and special. You somehow made me understand the importance of self-care and love. And that will continue to help me for a long time now!

Thanks for the awesome treats! I could only have a few, and yours can make up the major ones XD. At the same time, thanks for not turning me into the Women's Cell's custody XD. Thanks for bearing mine and Dipuk's nuisance XD. Thanks for that card; it was a tear-jerker. With many more turns of life awaiting you, I believe you will continue to become more of the person that you are at core - independent, strong, hardworking, and forward-thinking.

You mean a lot to many people and cherish the times they have had with you. Bas aise hi raho. You will undoubtedly make use of every apparatus available in your life tools to rise to heights that many can't. Chaapte raho dost! Your journey has just begun, and you will surely do great!",Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju,True,60c0d87d659165b3aa64525d,Yashika
