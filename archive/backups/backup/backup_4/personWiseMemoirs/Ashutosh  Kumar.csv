Wo almost har course ke baare me rona dhona se leke profs ki bitching tak sab kar rakha hai hmlogo ne.... 😅

Apart from acads bhi we resonated in more ways than one. CCD and Doaa ki coffee ke bahane bhi bhot hangout kara hai hmlogo ne saath me. Looking back I wish we watched a lot more movies together ek hi dekha hai aaj tak saath me, should have done that more 🤔🤔. You were always easy to talk to and  u were one of the very few who actually used to listen to the problems instead of just shoving it off, u were also one of the very few i could talk to about almost anything.  Ab as a person tmhare baare me kya hi bol sakte hai chaapu to tm ho hi bas chaapte rhna and remain the kind hearted soul that u are. 🙃🙃
No goodbyes i really hope to c u sooooon till then all the best

Wo end sem ke beech me movies dekhna wla scene to sirf tmhara saath tha 2-3 baar gaye hai hmlog most probably.

I am pretty sure neither one of us know how tf or when we met and how we ended up becoming such good friends 🙃 (friends would be an understatement idc 👀 ). We actually don't have anything in common lol 🤣🤣 (now that's something). It was only later that we found out about the mutual love about movies and food (chick blast, dominos, chocolate room pretty sure we have tried 
every item on all of those menus plus zomato 🤤🤩 ). We even tried playing tennis which ended up with knee pain a lot of it 🙄 and how can i forget that dedication towards basketball 🏀 i mean i got better because of it. Plus damn dude u are so bad with emotions i mean i am bad u are way 
worse than me. Plus u gotta come up with better justification for your caffeine addiction ☕. That being said u are also one the most energectic people i have come across in college. And thanks for 
being such a positive influence on me and motivating everyone around you 🙃🙃.  Don't change the kind hearted soul that u are (maybe u can learn how to talk to people of ur brother's age 😂 ) . We should go on trip soon 🤞🏻
I tried to keep it short since u specifically mentioned not to write your memoir 😶. All the best dude and m pretty sure u are gonna make all of those unreal ambitions come true and miss u broooo ❤️❤️.

41,"Pandaaaaa ( the name suits you in more ways than one 😬 ) ... at leat kahin to tennis wali dp nhi hai 🤣🤣. I actually don't remember phli baar kab baat hui thi hmlog ki but m glad ho gayi thi 🙃 cuz I am pretty sure during the first year before we got into our departments tm academically sabse badi help the mere 😅, Especially that disaster of Phy (102 n 103 🙄) wo dono subjects paar hue the almost solely cuz of tmne jo padhaya tha 👀(which mostly included ye saare examples rat lo 😶). Raat ko 2-3 baje zor zor se thok rhe hote the tmhara gate and anjesh pura irritate ho jaata tha. Even after jab depts me chale gaye then we started haning out a lot more (mostly cuz of pubg and cards but that still counts) 😬. Emotionally i never got to know u but then again maybe that's for the best idk 🤷🏻‍♂️. Plus jitna zada introverted rhte ho tm start me utna hi zada baat karte ho once u get to know someone (kinda like me) and get comfortable around them. You are sort of a really fun person to be around. I think bihari ke baad sabse zada tmhare saath hi theatre me movies dekhi hai maine (5 large coke wala disaster 😵). You are also one of the people jo honestly apna opinions de deta hai as to what i should do and what i shouldn't (really appreciate that 🙃🙃🙃).Anyway saare specific memories likhne gaye  to bhot lambi story ban jaegi and most probably knowing you tm padhoge bhi nhi 👀... All the best for your future endevours (ye to likhna hi padta)...... Really hope to c us soon n let's go travel someplace when all of this is over 😊",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a4ea10819323d199d48285,Rohan Gupta (P Kumar)
42,"Are panther 🙃 tm to wakanda se leke south korea tak sab jagah famous ho ab kya hi likhe aapke baare me aisa jo baakio na pata ho.
Sabse phli memory to tmhare irritate hone ki hai jab mai 2-3 baje exams ke ek day phla panda se doubts poochne aata the. Uske baad tereko kabhi irritate karne ko mila hi nhi kuki tm itne zada
irritating ban jaoge ye kisko pata tha . Bhai tere room pe wo random baate from MBA kis college me karne jana chahiye to koi random bande ki harkato ko gaali dena.  🤣🤣 kaafi enjoyable memories hai apni. Likhno ko to bhot kuch hai but chote me nipta rhe hehehe... Hope to c u soon in good health all the best till then ✌🏻... cheers 🥂",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60c22d68659165b3aa645a64,Saroj  Anjesh
43,"Yo multi-sem dassa boi!!! 🙃🙃 aur prashant kaisa hai XD. Yaar tmhari consistency and determination ke liye to salute hai bhai tereko 🤩 matlab wing me koi kuch bhi kare tm consistently padhte the aur phodte the alag hi level pe. Apni bonding shayad mostly wo 1st year galaxy ke baad hui thi  🎨 kaafi karname kiye the udhar. All the best bro aage ke liye aur chapte rhna ( although bolne ki zarurat nhi  😅 ). Hope to c u soon aur room ke bagal me kabhi kabhi eccetric loud music ke liye sorry.....😬😬
