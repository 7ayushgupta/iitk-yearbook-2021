Hopefully abhi BT khatm ho gayi hogi zindagi ki kaafi had tk!! I was really happy the day I got to know youve sorted things out!! I know it had been hard for you for nearly a year but you made it through anyway!! I still remember the zumba in the orientation, when most of the people around us were not exactly interested in dancing and then there were us - OAT ke sabse last wali seedhi pe jo saath me naache the bakchodi me that was a very nice evening. I could enjoy that because of you man cause I know for sure akela toh nahi hi naachne wala tha mai kisibhi haalat me xD. Thanks for that!! I also remember that ome time you encouraged me to come to the tracks with you foe the runs and made me go for a run in the mornings too. I remember the countless times we turned the lights of our room in the night because seniors were in the wing. I remember those failed attempts at waking people up in the mornimg kust for breakfast. I remember that annoying samsung alarm which used to wake us up for the PE101 sessions. I remember the EDM nights that we attended together and had loads of fun. \\nThank you for all these memories!!
