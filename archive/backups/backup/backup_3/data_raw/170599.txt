Most eco students still don\'t know the actual reason for my passion for electrical courses (lol). People call you introvert but honestly I didn\'t felt that because you are my uncalled safe space which neither bothered or nor wanted to sort things. I still don\'t know why the hell I always scream at you, rant, sometimes fight (Yes I will take revenge of that slap) with you but still laugh and smile after talking to you without thinking about anything else. Honestly, from all those memicary, bitching i can say you are the most funniest person to be hangout with for me. And haa beware of my dreams, sach ho jaate aur tum pe bhaari padh jaate hai xD.","author":"Jay  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"608c5775819323d199d47554"},{"text":"It all started with Robocon in 3rd Semester. Time is the proof of how good friends we became in the last 5 semesters. We share a lot of memories in campus together. Let\'s start with the funniest one in the EE381 class remember how prof said \\"vo dono jo last seat pe baithe hain un dono ko matlab hi nhi hai class me kya chal rha kuch\\" and we didn\'t gave a damn even after hearing him. Remember how we used to find excuses and parties of random shits to go to CCD and hall 12 canteen. Remember the Manual PID which was most non-technical thing we can came up with but good thing it worked. Remember the placement session how fast we were in sharing the links. Now, Thanks to you for bearing with me and another thanks to you for helping me pass in the online semesters warna kya pata ek F aa jaata. For all the time we spent together I came to realize you are one of the most hard working and honest person I have seen in my entire life and I salute you for that. You are also one of funniest to hang out with tabhi to itne acche dost ban gye. In the end I just want to say Keep it up bro these are your strengths and I truly believe you will do wonders in life and another thing bhul mat jana bro.

Apna safar to iss IITK ki journey se kaafi pehle se shuru ho gya tha, and kaafi baad tak milte hi rahenge for sure. But theek hai, aaj tak aise mauka nhi mila kyunki hum dono hi kaafi cool kism ke log hai xD Jay jitni emotional baate nhi likhni aati par haan, tum ho toh bilkul alag personality. 11th me toh darr lagta tha bhai, isaan hai ya bhagwan. Sab pata rehta hai, sab padha hua hai.. Lagta tha wapas JEE de rha hai humare saath, ek do baar nikal hi rakha hoga pehle xD Wese mujhse jyada darr BNM Sir ko lagta tha tbh (haha, lol).\\nAnyway, wo bhi \xe2\x80\x9cbadiya\xe2\x80\x9d din the, kyunki tumhare saath sab badiya hi hota hai. JEE ki prep time ki best memories tere saath hi hai kyunki tu hi itna serious tha poore batch me xD. Tests ke baad paper discuss krna toh 11th se hi hai. Pehle sirf meri faadta tha, baad me poore wing ki (specially, buchas fuffa) xD\\nLast paper ke baad CP ke samne khade hoke \xe2\x80\x9cAll the Best\xe2\x80\x9d bola tha jab, tab laga tha shayad last time mil rhe hai.. but kya coincidence tha bhai! Same IIT, Same Hall, Same Wing. \xe2\x80\x9cHum Alwar se aaye hai!\xe2\x80\x9d will remain our tagline. College me bhi nhi sudhre tum (actually, bigde). Abhi tak wahi Sabhay ho jo sabse jyada magta hai, sabke doubts solve krta hai (CP se hi hai ye to), sab padha sakta hai before exams (kuchh ECO wale log toh isi bharose pass ho rhe hai EE ke courses me xD). But bhai, tera dedication _/\\\\_, mene toh kaafi pehle chhod diya tha but you took this to another level. No doubt you deserve to be at the Top in whatever you do ahead. Your hard work shows, in whatever you have achieved. Kaafi inspire kiya hai bhai itne saal. Tum kar rhe the itni mehnat shayad isiliye sabne kr li thodi bohot jitni ki hai. Robocon ka MPID algorithm toh alag level tha xD xD. Tujhse jyada cool, calm and courageous banda nhi dekha bhai. Kaafi pessimistic hai bas, kabhi toh achha soch liya kar. EE360 me tere hisaab se fail hi ho rhe the hum log at one point. Glad to have travelled this journey with you and literally bhi IITK tak ka safar (Train wala bhi aur life wala bhi) hamesha tumhare saath hi rha hi aur aage bhi rahega (Train wala bhi, Train-Bus-Air wala bhi - Alwar to Aurangabad ka algo figure out kr lena bas). Theek hai, agar yahan tak tumne padha hai (which I doubt,.. beech me chala gya hoga PMI ka project krne), to ye bhi sun lo sehat ka dhyaan rakho aur jeevan me ab thodi aish krlo (#taalis lakh ka sahi upyog krne ke liye tau ko sampark kare, investment se expenditure ki saari maths bata denge). Theek hai bhai, \xe2\x80\x9cbadiya!\xe2\x80\x9d.\\n","author":"Suyash  Singh","visibility":true,"_id":"60a62722819323d199d48b3e"},{"text":"Kahne ko toh bahut kuch tha. Par kaha hi nhi, zarurat nhi padhi. Hamare beech mast bond hai, bina jyada bole hi samajh jaate hai ek doosre ki baate, Jay ki khichayi se lekar acads ki baato tak. Bahut doubts solve kiye hai tune, afsos hum eco201 mei return nhi kar paaye, lol. MTH101 se lekar yahan aa gye aaj, time badhi jaldi beet gya. Kuch kaam na hone par ek doosre ke room par aa jaate the, kaafi maza aata tha. :D\\n\\nTumhari fitness bhi gazab hai, bahu garmi lagti hai aur trips par tumhare \\"dost\\" aa jaate hai. 2 baar back2back covid ho gya. Iske bavjood bhi tumhara sports mei javab nhi. Baminton mei toh nhi jeet paate mujhse, ofcourse :P, but kaafi versatile ho. TT, Baddy, Cricket, aur pata nhi.\\n\\nTum bhale hi wing ke last days at hostel mei nhi aa paaye, koi baat nhi, video calling ki tech ne kami nhi hone di.

I don\'t have any words to describe how special our friendship is to me. The fun we had together everywhere on the campus, in classes, playing, trips to serious discussions on various topics, I have enjoyed each moment. I remember we played a lot of mobile cricket games, especially in our database class \xf0\x9f\x98\x81.  I am forever indebted to you for the help you gave me in all the courses \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f. I am very happy for all the success you have had till now and completely sure you would soar to great heights! All the best and hopefully don\'t forget me \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b and keep in touch.","author":"Sathvik  Bhagavan","visibility":false,"_id":"60afc6df659165b3aa644e6e"}]}]'
