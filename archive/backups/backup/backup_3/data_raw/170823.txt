Jab bhi kuch kehna hota hai tumse mai toh seedha keh deta hu tumhe dont think aisa kuch hoga jo nahi keh paaya hounga. Thanks for giving me that space and trusting me at the same time. I remember that one time when you sensed that I might be overthinking things and might be in the guilt that I have messed up things. You knew I might be hurting myself just by overthinking on that and you sent me the most comforting text one could possibly send at that time. tbh I was really really scared at that time and you helped me. Life is weird no? Sometimes we help people and we think that it is a very small thing for us but it really means a lot to them. Thanks for that. Well this was just one incident, I think there a lot more incidents where you helped me when I wasn\'t doing okay, Even lockdown ke time me you were one of the very few people jinse meri har roz baat hoti thi and I think uska reason bhi obvious hai. You end up where you find most comfortable.  Thanks for existing. Thanks for everything. I will never forget the antaragni nights when we scrolled tinder together, the nights in sixth semester when we bonded and opened up to each other, that one whole night when we shared the gossips, the days when we planned out things together, the last night when you gave me that letter and other countless occasions. It was a very wonderful journey. A journey holistic journey in fact. I really enjoyed the journey and I hope you enjoyed it too!! Thanks for making it special. You are one of the few people I go to whenever I do not feel good and yet everytime you make me feel great about myself. Thanks for existing.
