Thank you for the daily dose of dopamine and serotonin via the memes you put out there on a daily basis. You may not know it but sometimes a meme is just enough to make someone\'s day :).

Dunno if you recall but you do owe your SG tag to me (context: First Year Summers hazard) and we\'re kindof co-baaps to your kids :P (maybe you do owe your CS tag to me as well then XD).

I don\'t know how, it was mostly because you kept pushing me for good, but we became really good friends from that awkward dance in Antaragni of 2018 where I first met you guys \xe2\x99\xa5. You have always helped me in campus and off campus as well, especially during the placements season when I used to be scared and you always used to support me. It has been because of friends like you that I have been able to achieve whatever I have. I don\'t want you to think this of as a thank you, goodbye vala note. We will always stay in touch no matter what happens, but it\'s just a mere expression of gratitude from my side as to how dear and close to my heart you are. Be it listening your relationship ka rr on OAT rooftop, or knowing your secret crush \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b or even going for a walk with nonz, or deepak or even sitting in student lounge or library with you! I have enjoyed each and every moment with you. Ha we still need to get some photos together, and another thing I regret is not being able to say goodbye to you in campus.
