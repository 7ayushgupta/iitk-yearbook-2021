I think I probably heard you talking when we all started studying in CC. Most of the times of going out of the campus in the first two years were with you guys. Probably the first one was the Udghosh Marathon we went to cover at Green Park. I still remember that day. It was the begging of our journey in Udghosh.\\nAlso, thanks for helping us with the photoshoots!\\nAll the best for your future and hope to hang out with you guys in the future too!","author":"Nupur  Mehra","visibility":true,"_id":"60a3c610819323d199d47f6c"},{"text":"Yo Nadda! Coaching ke din bakchod the yaar, vishnoi ki class me so jane se lekar aur bhi bohot kuch karne tak. And campus days were more lit! First sem tere bagal baith ke hi nikal dia mai, padha toh kuch nahi but baate bohot kari. It was fun and comfortable.\\nWorking in Udghosh was good experience with you. Never mentioned earlier but yeh aankh dikha ke baat karne wali kya bakchodi hai xD. All the trips and restro visits are some of the best memories I am carrying with myself from campus. \\n\\nMilte hai jald hi, bakchodi karne chalenge...
