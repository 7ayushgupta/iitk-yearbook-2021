I had heard a lot about you from Jay.  We interacted mostly in the SnT council meets in Senate Hall. I recall that you had participated in the Electrowiz competition conducted by Eclub in senate hall. Your team was among the top-performing teams (mostly because many of the questions that I had set were from our common EE courses). Although we didn\'t collaborate much over any project, it was fun to jointly organize many events for SnT council.  I wish that we would have collaborated more with the Robo club.\\n\\nBesides SnT council, we did our EMEC lab of EE381 together. In 8th sem, we also did Prof. AKJ\'s estimation and detection course together. Our areas of interest may be quite different now. Hope that our paths may cross sometime in the future.
