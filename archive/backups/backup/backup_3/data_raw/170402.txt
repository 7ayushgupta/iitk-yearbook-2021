Hum sab E6-D6 kafi close the waise. That\'s where we began. I had never anticipated ki tu SnT mein ayega. And frankly before you became Batti coordi, I didn\'t realise ki itna chapu hai tu. Guitar, Gym, Batti, Microsoft and then GenSec bhi. We got more closer after Techmeet 8 and the elections. And fir 9 mein to macha hi diya. There were many things planned, but online mein we got a bit halted. No worries. Ab Consulting mein chapna. And yeah, do stay connected!

Remember those nights that we spent together in Hall 12 sitting in front of PIR sensor. Some funny events that I recall during our presentation at IIT B was the cup of tea spilling on the judge which led to our team getting extra time for the presentation.  The best part was our chat on the messenger group with Suraj, Abhigyan, Ashok. Might go through the chat to relive the experience of Techmeet once again !\\n\\nThe next memorable part was our second trip to Mumbai for presenting the prototype to BARC. We were fortunate to have connected with our alumni Sumit Chowdhury who later met us in Hall 12 canteen during his visit to IIT K.\\n\\nWe were really hoping to get a gold medal for the Roorkee edition by BARC/ Alphonso.\\nUnfortunately, this event was a closed-door event and we missed all the fun that we had in Mumbai. \\n\\nWe have been through ups and downs together in our Eclub journey. Thanks for always supporting me in my crazy visions for club. One last thing that we missed was our project on Crazyflie which had to be discontinued due to covid. Our batch will be remembered as the one which revolutionized the club. Not only did we bring in new initiatives, we also renovated the club and redesigned the club website. \\n\\nYour tenure as Gensec will also go down in history for bringing back the title of Techmeet winners. Hope that all four of us will have a chance of reunion some time in the future. \\n\\n","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":true,"_id":"60a6a5e3819323d199d49152"},{"text":"Last year main tujh jaisa dost milna one of the best chiz thi meri tenure ki.
