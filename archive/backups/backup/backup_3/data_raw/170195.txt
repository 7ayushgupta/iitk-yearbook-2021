Pehli baar milke aisa laga tha bhai, yeh kaafi shaant swabhaav wala banda hai. Quiet and introverted. After, all these years with you, I can safely say that it was just a facade in front of your parents ;p \\n\\n Kaafi kharab dance kiya tha maine aur tune freshers me, our first group \\"project\\". Then, PClub ke game dev competition me tune single-handedly jeeta diya. Tere hi wajah se graphics ka course liya tha jiske liye aaj bhi Keshav gaali deta hai mujhe. I never quite understood how that complex brain of yours thinks. Before studying anything, tu bolta hai ki tujhe nahi aata, and fir thode din baad milo toh bolta hai, arre yeh toh itna obvious tha.\\n\\nOne of the most chaapu and overachiever guys I have met. You always strive for perfection in whatever you do be it coding a game/RM room, making some sketch of a chair infront of you in your notebook, or your work. Super intelligent, kyunki you always ace all the coursework on any project but at the same time, have some out of the ordinary notions regarding Tulsi and whatnot. Having said that, you should know that I respect you a lot.   Goa trip me tere jokes, mere maze lena, and your awesome driving skills hamesha yaad rahenge.\\n\\n Let\'s finalize on that trip in August and will surely arrange one in Europe. You are the most baniya guy I have ever met. Combine that with that big fat brain of yours and we have my richest friend and acquaintance. Baitha hoga kisi hedge fund ka ceo ban ke 10 saal baad toh it\'s better that hum sab tere se connected rahe :p. \\n\\nGrateful for having the opportunity to know people like you.

I thought you are a very \\"shaant\\" type of person, less talkative-more work, but it was as wrong as it could be. Our initial chats \\"Askr\\" were more about RETs, AITS etc. Never knew we\'ll spend our IIT time so close.\\n\\nWe enjoyed a lot in our college stay. Saath assignments karte the, class jaate the (bahut kam jaate the although), Z-sq jaate the, Domino\'s ka pizza khaate the, CCD jaate the etc. CFD aur ICPC bhi saath gaye the. I have spent some of my most beautiful memories of IITK with you. \\n\\nMy only way to crack group assignments was simple -- get you and Umang together and then just chill. You always absorbed the technical parts and left non-technicals to us. Interestingly, humare saare collaborations turned out really well and I hope it is true in future as well.\\n\\nYou are intelligent, hardworking, dedicated and humble. No show-offs (except a few).
