I didn\'t break it but I accompanied him when he was coming to return them to you, so in 3 bot near room 127 you were a bit upset and angry too and were asking Ravi to pay for it and I said: \\"chill hai bhai ye sab hota rehta hai and humne nahi toda racket pehle hi tuta tha.\\" \\nFrom such a haphazardly meet to super attractive brozz \xf0\x9f\x98\x86 we have come a long way.

Being so cool, humble and down to earth you taught me how one should be, from always helping people in spite of being troubled on your own you taught me what being a part of community means in true sense. And from your sincerity I learnt what being ready for the challenges that life throws at you means. And a lot more.......\\nAlthough not only I learnt how to be I also learnt how not to be from you (iykwim).
