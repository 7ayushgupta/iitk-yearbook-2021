I recall our time together in InterIIT tech meet 2018 at IIT B.  We had participated together in the Engineers conclave.  That day spent with you and Jay was really fun.  I was expecting you to continue in Eclub as a coordinator from Hall 5.   In 4th sem, we did our TA202 project and ESO203 lab together.  We did not connect much in 6th and 7th sem though. I am glad that I could connect with you again in 8th sem while collaborating on AML course project.  Hope that you will stay in touch. All the best for your future endeavors.","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":true,"_id":"60a96640819323d199d4941e"},{"text":"Hey roomiee... room saaaaaaaf rakha kr bhai.. waise to zyaada rha hi ni 1st year m..toh zyada bat hui ni.. pr maza aya..\\n\\nUnti dino m bhi bahut kuch pata chal gya tha mereko\xf0\x9f\x99\x83..
