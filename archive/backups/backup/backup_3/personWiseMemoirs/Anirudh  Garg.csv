0,"Hi Monika,
I remember meeting you in the EClub before the Techmeet in winter'18 for the first time. We had to sit still for that BARC TV project :D. That was really weird. We had nothing to do but to just sit. And then, we had to give that demo to the winter camp, that was so much fun, and I remember our circuit not working in front of the juniors after I had explained the theory...lol. That was embarrassing. We did the EE381A lab together. Remember the first 2 DCMP experiments?? The first experiment took nearly 4 hours, and the second we couldn't even complete in the allotted time. I remember us complaining about the size of the breadboard and how it was too small for the experiment. It looked so crowded with the wires going everywhere :P. The happiness on our faces after it finally worked was priceless. Then, there was the EC lab. I still remember us sitting around and trying to figure out the oscilloscope and filling the sheets with fake results...lol. Thank god, we didn't have to make that car. I still don't know how we would have done that. I always found you to be a cheerful person and a constant source of happy vibes. You always knew about everything that happened on the campus, and I was happy to get to know all of the gossips while we were making some circuit...lol. Thank you for being soo helpful always especially, in DSP or Image Processing... I don't know how I would have managed the assignments without your help. Always stay like this and all the best for the future. Let's always stay in touch and hope that our paths cross sometime in the future.

Saalon se jaanta hu terko. Pehle jitta energetic, annoying, irritating aur kanjoos tha, abhi bhi hai. But usse kahi zyada important, pehle jitta friendly, honest, caring aur humble tha utta aaj bhi hai. Mei bohot regret krta hu beech mei tujhse baat na krna but college mei shukar hai tune mujhe maaf kr diya. Different halls mei hone ke baad bhi apan almost roz milte the. Tere saath almost saare fests dekhe hai, raat - raat ko assignments kiye hai, profs ki bitching ki hai, GOT subah jag ke dekha hai, courses ki tension ki hai,  grades ke liye roya hai, placements ki tension ki hai, yeh moments kabhi nhi bhulunga. Although, woh iRage wale ka code tujhe merko bta dena chahiye tha :P, but fir bhi you are really special in my life.  Ab itte saalon ke baad apan alag cities mei honge, hopefully iss baar contact mei rahenge. Hamesha aisa hi rhiyo bro, never change and live your life to the fullest. 
All the best.",Anirudh  Garg,False,60a96d31819323d199d49420,Vakul  Bansal

We met for the first time when we had the interview for the Summer project at Electronics Club in summer '18. I remember you literally knowing everything about Skin Track, and I not know anything about it, but somehow I got through, and we got placed in the same team. That summer was fun: soldering circuits, building electrodes, checking 80 MHz oscillators, learning to code ESP8266, and then subsequently coding it a million times over and dealing with the male and female headers :P, and of course, dealing with our arrogant team leader (I hope you remember :P). To be honest, you were the most motivated among all of us to do the project, and it is because of you only that it ever got completed. In hindsight, that was the project that got me the internship eventually, so I guess I have a lot to be thankful to be you. You are literally the most helpful person I know and, above all a special friend. Thank you for overlooking the times when I have been indifferent to you, and thank you for always cracking me up with your pronunciation of Github :P and also choosing Cult meet over Tech meet in winter '18 :D. Always stay the same, never change, and stop pulling my leg so often :P. Wish we stay connected in the future.
All the best.",Anirudh  Garg,False,60a976c4819323d199d49427,Jaya  Maheswari
3,"Hey Bro,
I met you for the first time via the Electronics Club and then we prepared for the Engineers Conclave in winter '18. I still remember us struggling to find the display room for the project in IITB :P. You were always so helpful and I remember thinking to myself as to how much you know. Then, we did the TA202A project. I remember us bitching about the team members we ended up with but still getting through the course somehow. ESO203 lab was a nightmare, figuring out which wire went where and invariably us finishing our lab work last before getting to know that the rest of the groups used to cheat :P. The last semester in AML you really helped me bro, I didnt know anything and you literally covered for me so much. I hope I wasn't too much of a burden. I would always cherish your friendship Bro. Always be like this, never change. Hope we stay in contact. 
Wish you a great life ahead.",Anirudh  Garg,True,60a97061819323d199d49425,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
