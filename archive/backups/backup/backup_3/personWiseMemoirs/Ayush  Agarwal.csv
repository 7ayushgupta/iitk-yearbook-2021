Also dhanyawaad to all the times jab tune fest mein andar ghuswaya bheed mein <3

Dhyaan rakho apna and chaapte raho bhai.",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afe00d659165b3aa644e7e,Barot Divyanshu Bharatbhai
1,"I am pretty sure ""are yaaaar!"" se bahut log irritate hue honge XD! But that was something I did not know, so thank you for letting me know. Uss time bhi laga tha and abhi bhi lagta hai ki guts chahiye branch change karne mein to EE, when everyone is dying to get into CSE. Dyaan rakho and Chaapte raho bhai! Kabhi chalte firte milna hota rahega <3",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afe113659165b3aa644e7f,Debmalya  Sarkar
2,"Yo man!

Truth be told, I think you're also one of the people who will haunt KD lab for eternity and beyond. But, the things that have you achieved, Hats off! Man, you guys never stop, HOW?! 

Thanks a ton for the company in Violin classes! You play well, keep that going. I wish we had interacted more, discussions with you are fun! Remember the CogSci course discussion with you, me and Shobhit?  
I still think you gotta give me partial credit for the Stormlight/Mistborn introduction XD! 

Anyway, All the best for the future. Hope to keep in touch and can't wait to get a copy of your book soon!",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afd1a3659165b3aa644e74,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
3,"Alright! As promised, I'll start with you. I hope this thing has a word limit because it will be difficult to judge the point at which you'll stop reading and just call to ask what I have to say. Linear Algebra might've been the worst course that we had to endure, but it was also the one where we actually met for the first time. It was a strange yet perfect time for us to have become friends. Well, partly because that allowed you to steal Nutella on my birthday, but mostly because I needed someone to not judge me at the time. Somehow, I always felt safer with you. Sorry, I forgot your birthday that year, but I made up for it, so you cannot complain! You were the silver lining in my life when everything was bleak—someone who was always welcoming with a warm hug.

I still count our 4th semester as one of the best times I've had here, and it had a lot to do with you. From Psychology classes to TA lab shenanigans to binging Netflix to relishing our amazingly similar food tastes at god knows how many cafes to our 6 am walks (Trust me, I can't get up at 6!). The list never ends; we had good times. There are so many days where I recall you being in my corner, sometimes even going out of the line to support and stand up for me. The summer of 2019 will always be one of the highlights of our friendship; how I would look forward to us talking almost every day. I felt heard, and that is the best feeling there is. I don't think we had many differences at any point in time; however, we did get busy in our own different ways. Despite that, I'm glad that we've only grown closer and fonder with time. I hope our friendship is here to stay. 

Oh well, I think it's impossible to list all the million different reasons why you're an absolute gem of a person. Ugh, I wish I could say it all. I am proud of what you have achieved and in awe of the perseverance you possess. Also, It wouldn't kill to let the world see that you're a kind and sweet soul! But then, you know your worth. World is a mess right now, stay safe and stay healthy you moron! 

Anyway, just know that I have appreciated you every single day of our friendship. Aaah, I'll miss you a lot. Before I end this, I would like to apologise if I did you wrong intentionally or otherwise. Goes without saying that I’ll always be here for you, for better or for worse.  

Thank you for my first Mclaren. Thank you for the matchmaking XD. And well, Thank you for everything. 

PS: We'll always be Netflix buddies, and don't you dare leave!
PPS: Never stop sharing dead baby jokes!",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60a6cbca819323d199d491ba,Gunjan  Jalori
4,"Yo Jay,

I do not recall meeting anyone else with the fervour for Finance that you have. I'm glad that I am not alone in this madness. I'd like to believe that your determination at it was something that inspired me to  firmly stick to it too. Although, we did not interact much outside of all this, but iss cheez pe toh kaafi baar bond kara hi hai! Pun intended. 

All the best for the future man and may we meet some day at Wall Street over a cup of coffee.",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afe272659165b3aa644e80,Jay  Gupta
5,"Bhai Mohit yaar, kitna seedha-saadha acha aadmi hai tu! Makes me wonder aajkal kitne hi log bache hai aise. Seriously man, even though humne kam hi interact kiya but Akshay se hamesha hi suna hai (and dekha hai) ki kabhi bhi kuch bhi cheez pe help karne ko ready rehta hai! I adore that quality about you, keep that up man. 

Baaki tu mera and Akshay ka naya student to hai hi, yeh classes toh aage bhi chalti rahengi XD. Take care, and all the best for your future. And ofcourse, Verstappen for the WDC!! ",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afcf2c659165b3aa644e72,Mohit  Yadav
6,"Yo Ramji,

Mai toh ussi din fan ho gaya tha tera jab youtube pe gaane ki chords sunke seedha guitar pe reproduce kar diya tha tune within 5 minutes. You play really well, keep at it. I've always found you to be such a humble guy. Unfortunately, we did not spent that much time but the occasional tech-suggestions were fun! 

All the best for your future.",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afe37d659165b3aa644e81,Ramji  Gupta
7,"Yo Sarthak,

Suna tu bhi Gurgaon aa raha hai? Man, from Jaipur to Kanpur to Gurgaon, the story continues. Jaipur mein toh tere jaise logon ke bina kya hi hota mera. Never got a chance to thank you enough for that. I've rarely seen someone as smart as you be as humble and down-to-earth as you are. It is one of the best things about you, always keep that up! 

Baaki Gurgaon aaye toh milna zaroor. All the best for the future, aise hi chaapte reh <3",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afcdd3659165b3aa644e71,Sarthak  Singhal
8,"Yo Shobhit!

Aren't you one of the sweetest person on the campus; always ready to take a joke sportingly. I am glad to have known you for this short while. I love how humble and down-to-earth you are despite being no less talented than everybody else around. Tujhe aise randomly dekh ke hall mein/campus mein dil khush ho jaata tha, itne dhang se treat karta tha hamesha and hamesha Hi bolke jaata tha <3. Anyway, all the best for the future, keep up the hard work.
 
PS: The Pictionary match in the last week was pretty dope!  ",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60b0a51c659165b3aa644e99,Shobhit  Jagga
9,"Hey Sidjay,

Thank you for you kind words on the FB goodbye post. You're such a determined guy, always burning the midnight oil on something! Pretty sure your ghost will haunt KD lab, helping the future students in need XD. I remember the German skit practice in NCL, it was super fun! 

All the best for your future man; pretty sure you will reach great heights!",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afcc5b659165b3aa644e70,Siddharth  Jayashankar
10,"Yo Kuwade,

Generally apne saare interactions Vox mein hi hue, but those were incredible fun. From discussing latest gossip to ongoing gymkhana politics to pressing issues we needed to work upon. Remember that we also wrote our first Vox article together, ""Fresher's Fundae"". It was a pretty great moment at the time. I have always seen you as a dedicated hard-worker and I hope you reach great heights.

All the best and I hope we'll write something together again.",Ayush  Agarwal,False,60afca67659165b3aa644e6f,Yash  Kuwade
