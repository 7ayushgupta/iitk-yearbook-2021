Yaar, it was pity that we didn't talk before 4th year. Bhai, bohot kam logo se pehli mulakat mei hi connection feel hota h, I felt that with you.

Wo yaad h jab second year summer ke liye project lene gye the to kya bakchodi ki thi humne😂🤣,aur wo project kuch kaam bhi nhi aaya😂. Fir wo internship ka randi rona. And then placements mei tests ke baad😂😂. 
Yaar you are one of the most genuine person,I met on campus. Aur honest bhi.
Yaar, I can't tell you how good I felt when I got the news of your placement. Being so low after phase 1 placement, and then the way u have worked hard is pretty commendable.

All hail the mighty bakait😂. 
Bakait you are one of the most hard working person I ever met. We first really talked during the first year summers, remember eco 101.And during that time I understood what people really meant when they talked about you.
During second year summers, seeing you work all day long was mind-boggling. You really inspired us to work harder, which we sadly didn't 😂😂. 
Bakait remember those scooty rides during trips, everybody was hell scared to sit behind you. You need to give me some credit here to show confidence in you😂😂🤣. 
The way you train your mind to do difficult work is very commendable,like in those running sessions 
 Bakait, you have got a  sharp mind with even better work ethics. So, just be a bakait always. You are going to be champion in anything you do😁",Shashi  Shekhar,True,609abbce819323d199d479ad,Akash  Gangwar

I remember you hated hss courses in the first year, aur ab aapne jitna diverse topics padha h utna kam hi logo ne padha hoga.

Acha hi hua hamari 12th mei baat nhi hui, we were smarter more matured individuals when we met.

16,"I am very humbled and overjoyed by your memoir. But the downside was that you covered pretty much all the major incidents😂. So i need to put on my storyteller hat now😜
So my friend, brother, guide, inspiration motivator and hopefully we can add more things here in future.

I thought about when we met or when we became friends, and i also don't remember that😂😂.
Straight to the point now 
You have always inspired me with your work ethics, I remember you living almost perfect(in terms of utilisation of time) life during first year summer. Then during the internship season (ok..,I accept we didn't work hard enough ), but you still utilized your time better. Then do you remember development economics midsem , you had read everything and then you taught me(now please don't take your mind to grades) . I was amazed to listen your internship story, the kind of hard work you did was extraordinary. 

You have been a constant support right through. Without you people I would have never stood for the Senator. Do you remember, I was thinking of taking back my nomination and you simply asked what is the worst thing that could happen if I fight. You have  a niche' of saying right things at right time😂. 
You were a great support during the lockdown and placement process. You were the one who told me about zerodha and kaggle. Without these I would surely not have been at Blackrock.
I have always loved the kind of connection you make with people. You put efforts for the friendships to work(I should also say relationships to work😛). I really hope I learn this from you. 

Very thankful for that day when you asked all of us to sing solo(you people were a very good audience, I Would have surely laughed if I was in the audience 😂). I always thought about starting to write and thankfully I wrote my first शायरी that day. Whenever I am going to do my first performance, you are going to have a special mention 
On the storytelling part, I have been making stories from 11th class, it was just that for the first time I had an audience 😂😂

When I came to IITK, having very good friends was at the top of my list. And how lucky I am that we met. You were our only photographer in all the trips, you slept with us on train floor in front of toilet(remember that😂😂!!!!). You planned all the things we did in last 1.5 months. You are the glue of our group, you keep everyone together. You have this ability of thinking about the group before yourself.  Again, commendable!!! 

You are going to excel in anything that you do, but i really hope you find clarity soon. (And please don't overthink after making that decision)
I know, I haven't talked about relationships here (sorry 😂, अब शादी की उम्र है तुम्हारी)

And yes... Remember those endless discussions we had about issues India faces,we are surely going to work on them. So, take your life path accordingly 😂😂.

Thanks for making me a better human being.
Love.....
Chalo..... Badhiya(Bear hug) 😂😂

I don't remember when we met. But, I vividly remember our talks during 2nd year summers(modi won elections again😂😂), we spent a lot of time together in the next semesters. You are a very helpful being, there are very few as helpful and selfless as you. We have talked extensively during lockdown and placement. Your support really meant a lot.
The way you conducted elections even when you were so low, tells about your strong character and will power. 
You are obviously going to become an IAS.

19,"Hi lambi,
It is very difficult to write a memoir for a person with whom you have spent most time.. xd!. Do you remember by the time orientation ended. we both were as if we have known for ages. Hum dono ne kitna kuch saath kiya h( ok.. in most of these I forced you ) .Remember blood donation camp, kanpur marathon, antaragani pr, tera bilkul man nhi tha. But, this was the best thing about you, you never said no. Yaad h tune to apna room change hi kar liya tha in 1st year, Shi bakchodi hoti thi ( rishi ne tujhe romantic movie dikhayi thi .. xD., aur teri shaadi...) . We were going to become roommates in 2nd year, but I guess it happened for best. Our friendship hasn't been any short of roller coaster ride. Bc, Maine jitna tujhe manaya h, utna kisi  ladki ko manata to pakka pat jaati. But, here comes your best trait, you have  such a tender heart, and you are such an emotional guy, ki last tk aate aate to ulta teri tension hone lag gyi thi..xD. 
Yaar, we both have been together in some difficult situations be it during internships, then lockdown, and then placements( har test ke baad randi rona krte the...xD). Thanks for being a constant support and partner during these times... Aur haan, jab teri placement nhi lag rhi thi, I was very stressed ki tu chod na de, but the way u handled yourself was lovely,<3. Bohot acha hua ki lockdown ho gya, nhi to hum log ludo hi khel rhe hote placement ke bhi time...xD.
Movies/ tv series- When we first met, I thought ki preparation ke baad aaya h to isliye itna interest hoga, but the kind of dedication,you showed for this, itne mei to pakka dassa aa jaata...xD. During 1st year you used to be 7 hrs on the field, and the rest of time on your laptop( i have never been able to understand how u could do it). Yaad h tune aur piyush ne compete kiya GOT khatam krne ke liye( tu hi jeeta hoga most probably).. Now , i have understood this, movies hobbies(...xD) nhi h lamba ki, they are integral part of u.
Sports- During the first year I was shocked to see ,how can someone have six pack abs without gym. But,you have always been athletic and zero figure. ..xD. The shine in your eyes and the change in your body language while you are playing is very pleasing to see. The energy that you put in sports is just mindboggling. You could play for 8-10 hrs a day. Starting a game in second year, and to become captain in 3rd year, is an astounding achievement. Yaar, mai to abhi bhi kh rha. professionally sports mei chala ja. You would be way happier. 
Yaar last 1.5 months with you was pure gold. Our photo sessions were lit. And that music event. ooh really sorry I laughed..xD. The way you keep the things clean, and in order in an aberration from college rooms( tu kitna emotional tha isko leke, teri aadhi fights logo se isi pe hui hogi). 
Good bye to apna hoga nhi, abhi to teri shaadi bhi karwani h(waise tujhe ke leni chahiye by rajasthan standards..xD). Aur,I am already saying sorry for the things I say/do when we are in gurgaon. We are obviously going to have a lot of fun whenever we get there. 
Chal milte haan jaldi hi. Is baar to dassa pakka aa rha hoga, nhi....xD.

We were the only 1st year people in hall 2 who were living in double sharing(thanks to vipin). Yaar, I was so blessed that you were my roommate in my 1st year. Tune pura 1st year friends dekh ke nikala h, yaad h. Tu maggu to bilkul bhi nhi nikala, ulta mujhe lagta tha ki khi fakka na lag jaye( but aap jaise chapu kitne hi h). Pata h log bolte the, ki rishi bohot arrogant h. Unko kya hi pata tha ki tera koi filter hi nhi h. You were one the most honest and straight forward guy I met. Yaar wo night out with raman was class. Hum log first year mei har jagah saath hi gye h. Aur wo lucknow trip( tujhe kitni pyaas lagti thi yaar). Aur haan, koi banda itna time kaise nahta h( tujhe 45 min lagte the). Aur yaad h jis din tu nahta tha us din tu pura room saaf krta that( it was sad ki wo din jyada nhi aaye). Yaar I loved, you debating on controversial topics, tera sochne ka tarika hi bilkul different hota tha.

26,"Hi Vipin,
My guardian, counsellor, brother and a lovely roomie.
Oh.. Vipin the way we talked when we first met, I never thought you would face the problems that you faced. Now when I think, I guess we connected the moment we met. Okay, really sorry for not understanding the gravity of the situation that u were in.  Respect for the way you came back(more on this later). Asking you to become my roommate in 2nd year, was the best decision I took. (I guess I have always been blessed...xD)
I used to think, that I have a lot of unnecessary drama in my life, and then I met you. I have seen you face every strange kind of problem a person could face( remember the struggle every sem during pre reg. or add drop, the laptop issue, you taking unnecessary difficult courses, and now the pg roll no.). So many experiences for a college life...xD).
You have always supported me, in everything I have done, listened to all the crazy ideas and theories that just keep coming into my mind(You are a very good listener). You have given me a feeling of home, a person with whom, I have shared everything( you are very good at keeping secrets). You have scolded me whenever I have lost my path( I loved it).  You never talked when I used to meditate. You have this exceptional trait of giving everyone space to grow and express. 
The hard work and energy that you would put in everything was exceptional, you would just keep studying until you understand the concept. I was always in awe of the calmness that you exhibited during exams(studying at 4 am in the morning ,still trying to understand concepts instead of remembering them) , remember you once got addicted to rolls( a strange addiction i would say), you are an excellent critic of movies. Your love for suspense thriller took you to Korean movies/shows. And remember u watched korean shows in the middle of exams. Oh. those were crazy times
I haven't seen anyone grown more than you in the past 4 years. Starting from an hindi medium background, struggling to understand the lectures in 1st yer to doing a minor in English literature. Struggling to talk / interact with people in the 1st year, to your present confident self. who would give these excellent 1 liners. A person who was going to leave IITK, to the present self who is going with a dual degree. A person needing psychological help in the first year to the present self ,who can counsel anyone.
Vipin, I know we are going to be friends for life. The way u supported me during internship time,lockdown and placement was very heartwarming. .
Brother, I am always there in every situation u need me. Just call/meet and yes, don't overthink.
I am never going to say goodbye to u.  I have no doubt, you are going to do great things in life. Always be your calm ,confident self. 
Love you brother...
And yes keep calling me....
