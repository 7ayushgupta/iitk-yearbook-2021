0,"Another chaapu, systems + OS expert, speed typer and one of the most honest person towards their work with an intense love for programming, optimization and efficiency. I am fortunate to have grokked through so many CSE courses, labs and assignments with you. I first met you in the ACA project group. There were two groups one who were using hanwen/go and the other using bazil/fuse for the project. I remember how both of us being the minority using bazel, collaborated to finish that unachievable task of building a FUSE filesystem 😅. Since then we have worked together on so many things starting from ESC201 Labs (yaad kar tere ko batti mein itna interest aa gaya tha ki tune batti ke major courses lene ke plans banaye the 😂) to Data mining, ENG467 and CS610. Though our conversations were mostly restricted to CS topics, it was mind-boggling to see how much you had to say about everything (not to mention the speed at which they were said 😛). If I ever started talking with you, my biggest concern used to be when it would stop 😛. Nevertheless you were always very outspoken, fun and energetic to talk with. I remember how you used to tell me ki 1st year mein tere kaafi courses chud gaye the, but wahan se tune kya U-turn maari hai and saare important CSE courses mein A* laake gadar chaapa hai. Kaafi hard-working hai tu and har chiz ki in-depth knowledge rakhta. Har baar tu sabse mushkil CSE course uthata tha and phir usme chaapta tha. Anyway, finishing this rant over here and wish you all the best for the future!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a8341d819323d199d4937e,Aniket  Sanghi
1,"Hey bro, It's been a long time since I've known you and one thing I can say for sure is that we started off as brothers and we will go off as brothers. You were always the guy I used to get positive motivation from. Very active, sporty, always optimistic, always on time and always planning ahead is how I would describe you. You were always so punctual, that I used used to rely on you more than my alarm (remember all my wake-up texts on the night before each exam). From our random bulla sessions to our OS assignment hangouts to my last day photoshoot, all moments go into my memory-bag. I still remember the night when your laptop erased a full-day worth of OS code you had written and you still had the determination to write all of that again. We planned to hit the gym together so many times, but it never happened :(. I still hope that you go to the gym with me someday in the future or maybe at least teach me your basketball tactics :P. I wish you all the best for all your future endeavours, and no doubt you will succeed in whichever avenue you proceed. Hope to meet you soon!!",Ayush  Kumar,False,60a70f5e819323d199d491dd,Ayush Hitesh Soneria

Har samay saath raha tu, sukh dukh and har stressful season mein, and not to mention, last month to kaafi special raha tere saath, bas ek chiz adhoora reh gaya, tere saath high nahi hua 😔. Kaafi change ho gaya hai tu 4 saalon mein (except your beard jo abhi tak nahi aayi 😛). Mujhe yaad bhi nahi kaise mulaqaat hui hamari, bas itna yaad 1 sem ke baad hi hum sab bhai ho gaye the. Canteen ka chikken tikka masala tune hi bataya tha mujhe sabse pehle. Tu shayad mujhe chaapu samajhta hoga, par jitna tujhe lagta utna hun nahi mai, bas kisi tarah saare courses paar hui hai mujhse. In fact main to bilkul book choota tak nahi hun. Tu kaafi hard working and determined rehta hai hamesha, and ek baar jis par focus karta use achche se finish karta. Par tu sab chiz ke saath kaafi humble bhi hai. Mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai, humne 2 non-veg pizzas mangaye the, and usne galti se ek veg de diya tha but tune wo wala le liya. Tune kaafi chizon mein meri tips liye, but mujhe kabhi apne relationship tips nahi diye 😔. Also thanks ECO764 mein mere assignments and presentation karne ke liye. Chalo, all the best for your job (thora workout kar lena Bangalore jane ke pehle 😛), hope you succeed in all avenues you pursue. Fingers crossed to meet you again!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a8344a819323d199d4937f,Deepesh Kumar Lall
4,"Another god and dassa king of IITK, you are one the smartest people and one with the most crisp sense of humor that I have known at IIT Kanpur. I was fortunate to get to do Codefundo with you and Abhyuday and then going for ICPC regionals together (we defnitely nailed our first attempt 😅) and then David's Auquan. You are the kind of guy who always has an elaborate plan for an apocalypse and will succeed at everything no matter how adverse the conditions are. Also thanks a lot for helping me out when I lost my 3rd year internship, you always have some of the best ideas to offer. I will always remember the times in class when you raised a completely out-of-the-box doubt baffling the professor as well 😛. Will definitely buy your book once it comes out into the market. And yeah, dogecoin is definitely not going to the moon 😔. Have a great time in the UK, and do invite us for a Europe tour!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,False,60a7c610819323d199d492bd,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
5,"Math God, Active Procrastinator, Pizza Lover, ChocoPie Distributor and what not!! You were my closest friend at IITK and my goto person for doubts, questions, random bulla, scientific/unscientific talk, help, enlightenment, imaginative theories, jokes, depression talk, w**d, or literally anything that a human could think of. There are so many memories we have together that it is hard to recall all of them. You started off as a quiet smart guy, but soon became our teacher in every course. I vividly remember the long tiring talk you gave on Goodstein's Theorem in the first year which none of us quite understood but it was still so fun listening to it. The canteen and pizza hangouts were my favourite. Pepper Barbecue Medium (plus an extra slice from my pizza), Maggi and Cheese Frankie was the the only thing you ever ate 😛. Your room was like an open theatre of knowledge. One could come in at any time of the night, and be certain to leave with a substantial amount of mathematical/philosophical knowledge 😛. 

You helping me to my feet when I was down was the norm, whether it was the Antaragni night when I was too hungover to walk, or the galaxy finals when I twisted my ankle hobbling down the stairs in excitement. It was hurtful to see your love for S***** P remain unconfessed 😥. It goes without saying that you are one of the smartest people I've met, and the most intense and profound math lover, the most surprising thing is how you achieve this with your god level last-minute decision-making skills (maybe procrastination is the solution to all our problems). Nothing can replace the awesome 4 years (minus 1 😓) I had with you. Wish you all the best in all your endeavors in the US (and in finding true love 😛), hope to see you soon!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,False,60a7cbe2819323d199d492c4,Hargun Preet Singh Bhatia

7,"Munmun, Haga, Harshaga, no matter what we call you, you'll always be the bubbly, cheerful, smiling guy I know. From dancing to searching research internships (remember going to senior dorms late night fishing for advice 😅), preparing for interviews (which I screwed up sadly 😪), collaborating in assignments and quizzes, NLP project, CS610 (we set a new benchmark for collaboration and bitching together 😛) and the Goa Trip, we have been together through all these times. We first met in the dancing group where I quickly became the notorious fraudy, and you were the only one who gave me hope that maybe I wasn't the worst dancer (sorry lol 😛). You were my goto person for personal advice, CS talk, random gossip, asking treats (none of which you ever gave 😔) and for help. Being an introvert, you were the much needed friend to pull me out of my bubble and help me meet other smart people (including you). How would I have ever learnt how to fake smile and click good photos if you weren't there as my mentor 😛. You are the most honest and open friend I've had. I can literally talk to you about anything without thinking twice, because I know we are bros. Thank you for making my IITK life a hundred times happier, worthful and easier 😌. God knows what hole of depression I'd have been in had I not found you. I hope no matter how far away you are, do not forget what this emoji means 👬, ""Bhai hai tu mera.."". Also, good luck in finding Korean women and do bring back Samsung Watches for me. Hope to see you soon!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,False,60a7ca02819323d199d492c2,Harsh  Agarwal

9,"Hey there roomie and bro, frankly I can say that no one has heard more of your weird-ass alarm-tone than me 😛. It was a nightmare sleeping everyday knowing that I'll have to wake up to that very irritating alarm 🥺. Right from the beginning you seemed like a very chill guy and I was quite satisfied when I found out who my roommate was 😄. I'm glad you were there in my room to prevent me from turning into an ultimate unsocial creepy maggu 😅, which I definitely would have become if you weren't there. You were my much needed distraction from study to keep me sane and healthy, not to mention the immense help I got from you in TA101. I distinctly remember your infinite shoe collection and how you had one shoe for every different activity 😛. I also remember the great standoff between me and satpathy over who should get the B5 wing and you came in at the end to save the day. I'm so happy to see how you have been able to maintain your long-distance relationship for so long, kudos for that!! I would definitely need some good relationship advice from you in the future 😌.

11,"I had always heard of you as the great chaapu of our batch, but only got to see it in our NLP project that you were much more than that. A bit quiet but very humble, easygoing, funny and smart we had so many fun (and a bit stressful 😛) nights in the KD. Don't know how we would have pulled off that project without you. I wish I had got more nights to spend in the KD but lockdown did us all. The Goa trip was our special memory, I will always remember the vegan food and all those ice-creams you had over there lol 😂, and the orange candy that you never shared with us 😛. Hope you forgive me for getting us late and then leaving you stranded at the airport 😰, I so dearly wish I could have stayed there and fought with that air hostess 😔, I spent the remainder of my flight thinking of all kinds of arguments I could have given to get you on board. I wish I learn some good investing strategies from you and maybe convert those Dogecoin losses into something useful 😬.

Uske baad se poora hi change ho gaya tu. Har chiz mein tune debate kiya hai mere saath starting from whether I was a good dancer 😛 or that tulsi tea is a good concoction for immunity boosting or whether we should return to campus for the last time 😛. But it was all worth it in exchange for all the quantum gyan you have given me knowing that I don't even understand the a of quantum computing 😛. You are the most constant thing KD has ever boasted about. This went without saying for everyone entering KD: Find yourself bored ? Head over to Snehal's desk and indulge in some of his unique (and sometimes even dark) humor or tech talk. Good humor is something that you have gained and lost in the past few years, and is once again on the rise after the Goa Trip (my humor did have an influence I guess 😛).
