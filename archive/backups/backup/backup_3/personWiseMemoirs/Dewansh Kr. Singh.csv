2,"I remember we first met because of basketball, and also our roll nos were close so we were even in the same PE group bhai. Kafi entertaining rehta tha wo time because of you and your always ready witty puns and jokes. 

But things changed jab ham dono ne Summer camp join kia, I mean they really changed man!!.  For me personally it was one of the best time of my stay at IITK. Jannat tha bhai. And it was all because you were there, Bhut shi bonding kri hai bhai hmne us 1 mahine me. Subh uthate the ek dusre ko jse tese, Pura din pel ke basketball khelna subh or raat or bs bch me khana or wpis sona. In sab ke bch jo hamne bakchodiyan ki hai, will never forgot them. Sbse jyada tuning/sync court pe bhi tujhse bethti thi, cheers to both us rebounders. Bhut shi time tha yr wo, Truly it was more like a dream when I think of it now, and you have been a major part of it. Also yaad hoga Reading room me Ac ke chakkar me pde rhte the :P hall 2 ke. 

Apart from this apne paths kbhi na kbhi cross hote hi rhe kbhi arts ka course to kbhi kuch, and I’m so glad they did, infact last ke 1 months bhi hmko khelne ko mila, relive krne ko mila whi time phle wla, im so happy that happened. 

I can’t thank you enough for being a part of my life at IITK, I will always cherish the time I’ve spent with you man! and I will always look forward to have more of it. You have such a warm and happy personality bro, also you’re an amazing artist . I cant afford to lose gems like you <3 . You’ll do wonders in life, Stay in touch and Take care. 

PS – Cheers to our 100 streak on snapchat <3 wpis ayega to fir bnaenge and  For every shot we missed  ""Lakri ka board hota to jati !!!"" :P

5,"I’ll write you a sweet and simple memoir just as sweet and simple you are. It was always so fun to hang out with you, such positive vibes. Remember how you helped me in first year with that broken dongle of redgear. Countless basketball and tekken matches, countless night outs without a reason and discussing investments, Life and even our Europe trip :P Also tera mera or vineet ka mess wla incident  😂😂  kachori >>>> idli vada. 
Jaldi milte hai bro, Ata hu me Delhi, Firse party and whi nightouts 🍻

8,"Ujjawal bhai, mere summer camp ke roomie, even if it was more or less a month :P. Thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent with you, be it in the court , in hall 2 , be it our failed Goa trip planning outside CCD. You've improved your game by leaps and bound bro, respect + 10000. I wish we could play together some day again and spend some time together like the good old summer camp days. Will always remember the time jab ham Ganga barage jaa rhe the to tune auto kese bulate uska demo dia tha .. ""OAAEee"" 😂😂. You're an amazing person bro, you'll do wonders, I wish you all the best for future. Stay in touch 💞
