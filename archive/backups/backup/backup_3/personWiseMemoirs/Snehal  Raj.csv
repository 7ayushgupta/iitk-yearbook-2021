0,"Adesh bhai! I had the good fortune of having the best room mates in first year. Ek taraf Keshav, ek taraf tum.

Yaar sach bataun toh first few months were especially challenging for me because I had always been in my shell. But sharing my room with you, three of us being each other's closest friends and passing the time away in jokes and laughter was awesome. I remember tune apna chair sacrifice kar diya kyunki mujhe bed pe padhne ki aadat nahi this. NCC ke liye hum teeno ka rona dhona, Mini Militia ke games, tere school ke kisse, all of those a really good memories I have.

You are not like the most of us jo coaching ke badaulat aa  pahuche. Tune apne dam par phoda tha, apne dam par phoda hai and phodta rahega. Make sure you always remember that you are the literal embodiment of ""cream of the nation"" and once you put your mind to anything, you are surely going to ace it. 

Yaar tum jaise bando se mil paya, isiliye I think my stay at IITK has come to fruition. You are hardworking, care a lot about your friends, care a lot about your family and now are going to do a lot for this country. I still remember, how nicely you talk to your parents. Sometimes, as we pass the teenage phase, we start neglecting our family and but I learned from you that no matter what, family first.

You are an incredible human and although we didn't get a lot of time to catch up(last sem wapis campus bhi nahi aa paya mai) I will make sure that we meet soon. Ab toh aap bade aadmi banne waale ho so it might be tough for you to take time out, but because I have seen the kind of person you are and I have lived with you closely, I know you would.

Cheers dost

1,"The first people from IITK I ever met were you and Ojha. Pehli baar milke aisa laga tha bhai, yeh kaafi shaant swabhaav wala banda hai. Quiet and introverted. After, all these years with you, I can safely say that it was just a facade in front of your parents ;p 

 Kaafi kharab dance kiya tha maine aur tune freshers me, our first group ""project"". Then, PClub ke game dev competition me tune single-handedly jeeta diya. Tere hi wajah se graphics ka course liya tha jiske liye aaj bhi Keshav gaali deta hai mujhe. I never quite understood how that complex brain of yours thinks. Before studying anything, tu bolta hai ki tujhe nahi aata, and fir thode din baad milo toh bolta hai, arre yeh toh itna obvious tha.

One of the most chaapu and overachiever guys I have met. You always strive for perfection in whatever you do be it coding a game/RM room, making some sketch of a chair infront of you in your notebook, or your work. Super intelligent, kyunki you always ace all the coursework on any project but at the same time, have some out of the ordinary notions regarding Tulsi and whatnot. Having said that, you should know that I respect you a lot.   Goa trip me tere jokes, mere maze lena, and your awesome driving skills hamesha yaad rahenge.

 Let's finalize on that trip in August and will surely arrange one in Europe. You are the most baniya guy I have ever met. Combine that with that big fat brain of yours and we have my richest friend and acquaintance. Baitha hoga kisi hedge fund ka ceo ban ke 10 saal baad toh it's better that hum sab tere se connected rahe :p. 

Grateful for having the opportunity to know people like you. To future times,

Cheers!",Snehal  Raj,True,60a7fa82819323d199d49305,Ayush  Kumar
2,"I am sure everyone knows how hardworking you are, how intelligent you are and yada yada yada (who the f**k doesn't ever get even close to getting a B what the f**k man!).

I still remember the first memory I have of you was the first year when the Prof was trying to derive some detailed result, and midway in his second page he gets stuck. After few minutes of utter silence and confusion, I one guy (out of the odd 400) pointing out that he did a small error somewhere in the first page (!!) of the proof. The image I had of you then is the same I have of you know. Super focused and Super confident.

I think we got to know each other better from the third-semester thermodynamics and in the time we spent together, I have come to know that you are one of the most helpful and honest guys I have ever met (and probably will meet). Sounds cliche? But people often underestimate the importance of being honest to yourself and others in terms of having a long-term friendship. That is something I will take with me forever.

This memoir can't encapsulate how grateful I am for getting me through this undergrad (special mention to that horrible ""apping"" season of 2019-2020). I would never really understand why you chose to be friends with me, help and guide me in almost all walks of life, and share my love for food and music. 

Although we didn't get the chance to invade our beloved base in the 8th semester (I was anyways planning not to be around in my 7th), you have always been a text away, ready to help/offer your honest criticism. I hope we stay that way forever. Now I know, this won't change anything but please please please please please decide against the K-word we are not allowed to speak about.

Cheers to good times, that were and that will be.

My closest of friendships with everyone else was a result of chance, or a previous common experience, but with you it was purely organic and born out of awe and inspiration for me and I don't f**king know what from you. Nevertheless, I think I cherish this the most. I am sure I will do everything possible to keep it the same and make it grow even stronger than it is.

4,"Bhai apan ek dusre ko Kota se jaante hai and I have seen your progress. Starting from a lower batch to getting the highest rank. You have managed to continue on that trajectory even at UG, and I am sure you will continue it even further along in your professional life.

We didn't have a lot of interaction in Kota but have great memories from the place, and I share that nostalgia with you. We started Undergrad with a freshers dance performance and maannn that was epic. Maybe people don't notice it often, but you can make people laugh and have made me laugh more than anyone in this college. I love your storied be it some incidents about your wing, Subhajit Sir, almost dying while river rafting or our inside jokes.


You are really pure from heart and have always been the most innocent guy.  You always speak about whatever you are feeling. Combine that with you intelligence and that makes you one of the rarest people anyone would come across. You always somehow make time to both work your ass off acing any task that you are assigned with and enjoy yourself to the fullest. You value friendships and relations, and I hope we maintain this friendship we have forever.

 Mai aur keshav ek team and tu aur durgesh ek team she shuruwat ki thi assignments and projects karne ki and that overall group has remained the same ever since  (Ayush had a wildcard entry). 

Every group needs a guy that leads from example and I am sure you already know it, but your are that guy in our group. Whatever task we are assigned to, you make sure that we do it super well and that's a quality which I think you should be proud of.  In this trip that we had, I saw how you were carrying us all. You were the one doing the hard stuff: managing our itinerary, negotiating prices, or taking care no one from our group is left out.  Let's make sure we have many more trips in the future.

I am indebted to IITK (and Kota ) for giving me the opportunity to meet people like you. Stay the same and prosper (which I am sure you would)

Cheers Harshaga

5,"There is no hiding how close we are, is it? One of the things I am most grateful for in my entire stay at IITK is the perchance that I got ""The"" Keshav Bansal as my roommate. That roll of dice, gave me a lifelong friend/mentor/role model and I am super grateful.

Everyone noticed that you were really shy and reserved in the first year but I always felt that you spoke when needed. You do not have any drive whatsoever to keep impressing people around you by talking and have believed in doing the work. Before that, this was something that I had only read or heard about, but with you I have seen it from my own eyes day in and day out. I proudly use you as an example while talking to anyone about what we should strive to be.


Many are humble from the outside, but you see that no one is always humble as you get to know them better. Well, I can attest to the fact that in the four years that I have been your roommate and closely worked with you on countless assignments and projects, you are humble through and through (even to the extent that I sometimes have to convince you of your caliber). 


I would have never learnt as much as I did, throughout the course of my stay here, if I hadn't met you. Your intelligence, ability to power through any task and your downright humbleness is unmatched to anything I have ever seen. And in addition to all of this, you have always been a great friend to me and we have shared countless laughs together. So believe me when I say there is literally nothing that makes me happier than being of any importance whatsoever in your life.  I have seen you transform into a more confident, funnier and a more chill-friendly version of yourself over the undergrad and I like to believe I have had some role to play in that.

There ought to be kinder people at the top of the food chain, and therefore I wish all the success to you.

I still have a lot to learn from you and will, therefore will try my level best to preserve this bond that we have.

Cheers Gawd!",Snehal  Raj,True,60a5fa7b819323d199d4888a,Keshav  Bansal
6,"One of the nicest human being on campus!

The first memory I have of you is I think our first wing interaction seniors ne karwaya tha and ek bhaari awaaz wala patla dubla ladka. Your voice is opposite to your personality. The first time we talked about football was on the mess table and although it is sad ki you aren't a madrid supporter you have never been irrational in your analysis and passion. (Which is rare trust me)

I remember football,tech, music and dance to be the most common things we share, baaki tu hamesha meri leta toh rehta hi tha for being the 6 pack figure that I am.  I really enjoyed talking to whenever we met and saath me Shubham ki lene me kya maza aati thi.  Bhai bohot kam log hote hai tere jitne ache and dildaar. I have seen how you would never shy away with sharing whatever you own be it tere snacks, tere headphones etc. Tere senheisers ka use I think tere se zyada baaki sab ne kiya hai. Dil se ameer ka hone ka sahi matlab terese seekha hai maine.

Itna kind and selfless hona and on top of that being so intelligent is extremely rare bro. Last sem ka plan kiya tha woh toh pura nahi ho paya but jald hi milenge.  Humara Tomorrowland saath dekhne ka plan yaad toh hai na? Let's add an el classico to that list and make it happen. I will forever remember you as the great human being you are who I had the good fortune of meeting. Stay the same bro, you are rare.

7,"Arre Uncle!! Boht mast aadmi ho Uncle aap. Pure IITK life me, anytime at the Mess table, I would look ki kahin Uncle baithe toh nahi hai. Agar aap mil gaye toh bas, kaam khatam! 1-1.5 ghante ka mahol set. Aapki shayari, Aapke bahaduri bhari Dosa waale kisse, manindra related inside jokes and Internship related baatein, bada maza aata hai uncle aapke saath.

You are the few individuals that would always make me life from your antiques and unique way of telling stories. Padhai me bhi aap kaafi self-motivated toh ho hi and always honest about what you know and what you don't. I am sure you will achieve great things in life and wish you all the best for the same.

Jald hi milte hai Uncle, aapki shayari sunne ayenge aur do chaar kisse sun aur suna ke jayenge.

8,"Bhai I don't know if you know it, but you are one of my best friends at IITK. Jitna bhi samay Kota ya Kanpur me guzara hai, isse yeh samajh aagaya ki intelligent and acha dono hona bohot rare hai. And you are one of these rare occurences.

Mujhe yaad the great partition of hagga, hagga ke iss paar waale B bot and uss paar waale and some other C bot. The irony is partition hone ke baad hi tumhe ache se jaana and really got to know a golden-hearted individual. Super helpful to anyone, really good natured and always honest and wanting to learn. Tumhara aur mera family background same raha hai and uss wajah se bhi we got close but the thing I like about you most is you make me feel special. Tumhare jaise dost sabke hone chahiye bhai jisse khul ke baat kar sake and important matters pe discuss kar sake. I have the tendency to speak a little more than what is required but you never disliked me for that.

Tum jitna izzat mujhe dete ho, I am sure I don't deserve that but it makes it all the more important for me to continue this friendship for long. Mai beemar pada tha ek baar and tumne kaafi madad ki thi. Kabhi bhi mai thoda anxious hu ya stressed hota tha, toh tumhare room aake hagge ke uss paar waalon se baat karke and hass ke acha lagta tha. Last sem agar campus me hote toh aur bhi bohot saare memories banate but alas we couldn't.

I am sure bade aadmi ban jaoge tum and I think tumne bhi mere saath 10 million lives wala vaada kiya tha. So let's catch up sometime later this year by means of trip and decide on what we are going to do about that promise.

9,"Expect toh nahi kar rahe hoge aage jo kuch bhi likhne wala hu mai, but padh lo (pata nahi fir likhunga ya nahi)

Campus me mera aur tumhara passive-aggressive relation is the most fun relation I have had. Kisi bhi din, kisi bhi samay, bas tumhare room jaake baith jao and kaafi maza aata tha. It just happens that even without trying you can crack jokes out of thin air by judging people, exposing unspoken customs and just using that sharp brain of yours to make super weird connections. Jab bhi room ghuso, hamesha lete rahoge, mobile dekhte rahoge aur agar exams paas aa rahe ho toh padhte rahoge.  Mai aur tum khaane ka interest bhi share karte the and canteen me numerous times saath me khaya hai humne. 

 First year me toh almost saare  and second year ke kuch courses saath me discuss karte the and Vipul Arora (fraud) internship bhi saath me hi kara tha. In general jo bhi courses tumhare saath kiya hai, usse yeh toh keh sakta hu bohot tez ho bhai tum. Mai ek mahina padh ke bhi jitne number nahi laa sakta, tum bc ek raat me nikal lete ho. People might think that you start studying late, but I would say that you start studying at the exact time that is needed. Ek week pehle se tumhara fatna chalu ho jaata hai and uss last week me jo kuch kar lete ho tum, that shows that you can adapt in any situation and are fucking intelligent.  I am sure you will excel a lot (I say this for very few people).

All our fights and dissing aside, you have always been very helpful and you have always respected me (more than I deserved). Bilkul bhi fake nahi karte apne aap ko and  apna mazaak udane se bhi piche nahi hat te. Tumhare saath rehke maza toh kaafi aata hai. I know you are driven highly by achieving success and kisi bhi cheez me dimaag laga doge toh achieve toh kar hi loge. 

In future, I will always be ready to help in whatever way I can and would love to keep in touch. Machate toh tum rahoge hi, bas apna confidence level thoda badhao aur woh tatti clash of clans khelna band karo.

I would forever remember the inter-IIT techmeet. Usse pehle bhi kayi baar mila tha tumse, and I knew you are really hardworking, always smiling and always helpful kind of guy. And sach bolu toh I went ahead with joining the contingent majorly because of you. That was one of the best experiences of my stay here. Forming a team just hours before the deadline, and then going ahead and winning the gold. Raat bhar jag jag ke we completed that presentation and then subah jaake we won the event.

I am sure you already know that you are a really good soul. Just want to reiterate that please stay the same. Milte hai jald.
