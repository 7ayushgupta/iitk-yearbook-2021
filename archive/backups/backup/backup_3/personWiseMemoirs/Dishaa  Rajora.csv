Amidst all the CATAN game nights, pizza nights, and bulla sessions at GH, our friendship grew stronger. Thank you for always saying that I don't need to lose weight :P 
P.S. One of the best memories with you would be the day we went to the Ballroom dance. Not because you dressed up in formals but because you went out with Gunjan an hour later. Yes, we both discussed it later on and are onto you. (:
