I came in touch with you through Eclub. I recall our time together in InterIIT tech meet 2018 at IIT B.  We had participated together in the Engineers conclave.  That day spent with you and Jay was really fun.  I was expecting you to continue in Eclub as a coordinator from Hall 5.   In 4th sem, we did our TA202 project and ESO203 lab together.  We did not connect much in 6th and 7th sem though. I am glad that I could connect with you again in 8th sem while collaborating on AML course project.  Hope that you will stay in touch.

1,"Hi Ankit,

I was fortunate to have you as my roommate in first year.  I remember that our room 324 and Ashok's bed in the middle was mostly occupied by Apurv who used to bring all the electronics stuff in our room.  We went through the ups and downs in our first-year courses together. I remember that your 1st sem endsem exams had got over before mine and I had two papers left but with a gap of 3-4 days.  You, me, and Ashok had watched around 7 movies together that night before my exam.   Some of them which I remember well are ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"", ""The Arrival"", ""Lucy"". I became so engrossed in having fun that night, I did not do any practice for TA101 lab exam and ended up with the only B grade in my first sem.  

We lost contact after our first year when both of us decided to change roommates.  Even our rooms were on the two extremes of 4 mid wing. I hope that you did well after your first year. Hope that we might connect sometime in the future. All the best for your future endeavors.

2,"Hi Monika,

Our interaction was mostly limited to our second year when you were secy in Eclub. We had helped each other a lot in 3rd sem courses. I specifically remember that I used to be overloaded with many activities in 3rd sem. I and Soumya had a deadline of TIIDC challenge and we also had ESC201 quiz the next day. You had helped me that night by sharing some assignment solution and I could solve a similar question that appeared in the major quiz.  You might have saved my grade for ESC201!
Thanks for that.

Do you remember that we had jointly organized the surprise birthday party for Abhigyan!  You were among the active secys at that time. No doubt that they made you the prospective coordinator in winter camp. I was expecting that they make you coordinator too. 

We did not connect much after our second year.  Our paths might be very different now. Hope that you will stay in touch. All the best for your future endeavors.

One of my most exciting collaborations with you was participation in TIIDC in our second year. Although we didn't continue the project further, it was a memorable experience. One of the funniest parts was recording the video for the challenge. If you still have the video saved in your drive, please DM me the video. 

I recall the night before the E club coordi interview when we were brainstorming over the million dollar question of ""How to keep track of the components in E club?""  Even after completing my tenure as coordinator, I haven't figured out a solution yet!   

During my tenure as coordi, many of my decisions were influenced by you in terms of deciding a project for club or purchasing any new component. Thanks for your ideas and support for Eclub.

Although we were a part of Eclub since our first year, I really felt connected to you during the period before coordi interviews.  I recall that we were given several tasks like club cleaning and bringing in new furniture. These were the first tasks that we did together as prospective coordinators (All thanks to Abhigyan who made us collectively do these tasks to build our bonding). 

You are the most creative person in our club. You were the face of Eclub managing the important role of publicity. Your poster designing skills are amazing.  I recall you taking a lot of effort to create the poster for the E4U initiative. Almost all posters and website designing were managed by you.  Your name will go down in history for redesigning the club website (https://students.iitk.ac.in/eclub/).

Thanks for being a part of my journey here.
We met first time in the E club winter camp. I recall that our first project together was creating an egg basket game in processing software where the basket was controlled using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. We also made an application using Android Studio. 

I am amazed by your knowledge of places to visit on the campus. Before I met you, I was not aware of sites like the oxidation pond behind OAT and the IIT K nursery at the end of the road to the auditorium. 

I was glad that you continued in the E club after the summer project on Skin Track. We jointly conducted many events for the club. Even after your tenure as a secy was over, you remained in touch with club activities. I recall that you had borrowed the LED strip from the club to celebrate your friend's birthday. You are really good at organizing surprise birthday celebrations for your friends. I recall that you had planned my birthday celebration in the Lecture Hall complex in my third year (However, it was not a surprise for me since you had invited Apurv, who leaked the info about your planning)


Although we didn't do many courses together, the one course we did together was the ENG course by Prof Ravichandran on ""Literature and the Individual."" I recall that we had rehearsed the debate of Kafka's "" The metamorphosis."" The debate was supposed to be on the spot, but prof never realized that we had decided our points-counterpoints beforehand! 

It is great that you, too, have plans to pursue graduate studies in the US. I hope that we will meet sometime soon. I will be happy to help you with your grad school applications.
All the best for your thesis work here and all future endeavors.

I recall that you had participated in the Electrowiz competition conducted by Eclub in senate hall. Your team was among the top-performing teams (mostly because many of the questions that I had set were from our common EE courses). Although we didn't collaborate much over any project, it was fun to jointly organize many events for SnT council.  I wish that we would have collaborated more with the Robo club.

Besides SnT council, we did our EMEC lab of EE381 together. In 8th sem, we also did Prof. AKJ's estimation and detection course together. Our areas of interest may be quite different now. Hope that our paths may cross sometime in the future. All the best for your future endeavors.

11,"Hi Mudit, 

Our interaction started with collaborating on the problem statement by BARC in our first Techmeet at IIT B. Remember those nights that we spent together in Hall 12 sitting in front of PIR sensor. Some funny events that I recall during our presentation at IIT B was the cup of tea spilling on the judge which led to our team getting extra time for the presentation.  The best part was our chat on the messenger group with Suraj, Abhigyan, Ashok. Might go through the chat to relive the experience of Techmeet once again !

The next memorable part was our second trip to Mumbai for presenting the prototype to BARC. We were fortunate to have connected with our alumni Sumit Chowdhury who later met us in Hall 12 canteen during his visit to IIT K.

We were really hoping to get a gold medal for the Roorkee edition by BARC/ Alphonso.
Unfortunately, this event was a closed-door event and we missed all the fun that we had in Mumbai. 

We have been through ups and downs together in our Eclub journey. Thanks for always supporting me in my crazy visions for club. One last thing that we missed was our project on Crazyflie which had to be discontinued due to covid. Our batch will be remembered as the one which revolutionized the club. Not only did we bring in new initiatives, we also renovated the club and redesigned the club website. 

Your tenure as Gensec will also go down in history for bringing back the title of Techmeet winners. Hope that all four of us will have a chance of reunion some time in the future.

We also shared many jokes together. Do you remember my vision for ""Umbrella Organization""?

You have been very helpful to me several times. In particular, I remember borrowing your bicycle many times when my bicycle was not in a proper shape. You used a weird chain lock on your cycle which was very heavy to carry around. 

In lecture halls, we have shared neighboring seats in all examinations of EE courses (In first-year Institute compulsory courses, Nitik had a seat between us).  You were always the first person with whom I discussed the exam paper.  Some of our exams were really bad ( Remember EE210 Endsem !)

I am fortunate that you used to borrow my notes before exams and create a scanned copy of those notes. Thanks for keeping a soft copy of my notes on your phone. These soft copies of my notes helped me later in 7th sem courses which required material from 5th sem courses (All my notebooks before 6th sem are still at the hostel room).
