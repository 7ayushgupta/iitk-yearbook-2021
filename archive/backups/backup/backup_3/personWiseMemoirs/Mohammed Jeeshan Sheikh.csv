We started interacting a lot by the end of 5th sem I believe and got the opportunity to work on our first professional commitment together. Honestly, aur maza aata agar ye sab virtually naa hua hota :(
Confession - DP tum change karte the but motivation mujhe milti thi XD
Baaki insaan toh tum kaafi sahi ho + always approachable! 
I still look forward to see new DP mein smile aur kitni killing hai :p

2,"Hey Aditya,
I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but Chirag ne first year mein baat faila di thi ki tum 'Alien' ho. 
Random sleep schedule, that signature 'Zombie' walk of yours, rock climbing @4am(🙏🏻) , a taste for doing stuff others hardly find time for(🙏🏻🙏🏻) and avoidance from interacting with noobs like me in comparison to Sharma ji the great :(
Anyways, thankfully after knowing you better I realized you have been a blessing to our wing. Kicking in anytime for football, mesmerizing us with your paintings, joining in for random games, and helping me locate my phone via Google tracker 😛
Rahoge aap one of a kind hi. Not bothering about what others say or do. This is something that separates you from the herd. Stay the same always!

Bio kitni hii 'simple' ho, you will still remain one of the stylish guys of our group.
Jokes apart, Kuch rare logo mein se ho who have remained the same since I've known them. ❣️
Humare lack of interaction ko jitna Coaching & School mein sections A & D ne contribute kiya, utna hii College mein different Halls ne 😅
But it's pleasure ki we still have our moments of shared interests and bitching about things we don't like 😉 
Baaki, Kabhi Kabhi express Kar liya Kar bro, people are dying to know you better 🙂

P.S. Cricket khelte hein ASAP !!

Ghosh Babu, thanks for being my Go-To guy for all CHE queries!
Ache Chemineer toh nhi ban paenge, but I'll feel proud to say I know atleast one person who makes things look more interesting!
Jitna proficient ho, utne hii humble bhi about everything you do. Stay the same always!!

I'll try writing this chronically, keeping your name in mind

3. NLP updates loaded

6,"Some things are better written than told, that's why I wanted you create an account.

Confessing that I pictured you completely wrong. A guy who keeps smiling all the time, places some family photos in his shelves, plugs in earphones in lecture halls and prefers watching House at night over the 'Taua' assignment next day.🙏🏻 
I think I've seen you sleep at every place we have been to in campus!
But with time I realized that's a choice you have made for yourself, not giving attention to things more than they deserve.
I personally admire that you don't budge easily, when everyone else is going mainstream. (But I'll keep pushing you about certain things you claim lack credibility ; your parents naming you 'Dev' is perhaps the biggest irony of your life 😜)
Sharma referred to us as the 'chemical bros of E-bot' in my memoir which I found funny given the differences we carry about a *LOT* of stuff, but that's amazing how we have gelled given that too.
(Chapai mein hum log pakde nhi gaye kabhi, that's a relief!)

Anyways, there are a dozen things which I need to thank you for, taking care of me at my worst is just one of them. ❣️
Thanks mate for being the sweetest spoken person I met, 'listening' to stuff I say and sharing this walk of life alongside.
Stay in touch 🖖

Kuch zyada hii innocent ho Bhai ❣️
First year mein itna interact nhi Kar paaye, all thanks to your roomie 😛
Thanks for taking out time for going on walks in the eve with me, lending me your stuff at odd hours, giving me company to spend time with people who were strangers to you and finally alloting me half of your room's space to keep my items without ever complaining  ❤️❤️
I will try my best to keep contact with you even when though you decided on parting ways early!!",Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh,True,60a521ef819323d199d4838a,Kanishk  Chauhan

Be it tumhara Prayas ki taraf unparalleled devotion or doing the work of all other coordinators single handedly ya phir endsems ke time pe PUBG :p
Chapuness is maintaining your smile and sanity after all of that! That Faculty Building ka breach and Z-square Ka prank would remain the most memorable moments of my campus life <3

9,"Hi,
I'm not sure who cleared whose doubts in coaching, but the journey was surely fun with you guys and honestly perhaps the purple patch of my life!
Yep, I would've liked us to interact more since we got in the same place but none of us knew the dynamics here, did we? 😅
Anyways, I admired you for having very refined thoughts during counselling about what you wanted to pursue, and seeing you stick to that over the years has been pleasing. 
I hope we'll be seeing each other more in coming future, All the best! ✌️",Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh,True,60a7da5e819323d199d492d1,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar

One thing I actually envy about you is ki itna self-confidence laate Kaha se ho? Stay the same, perhaps 
(I still feel Kohli se better captain hai humare paas 😌).


रसायनिक अभियांत्रिकी तो शायद याद ना रहे मगर ये मित्रगण ज़रूर याद रहेंगे। 
P.S. - Since you wanted ki Rcb ko cup uthate hue hum Saath dekhein, I've successfully postponed the IPL.

I still wonder about the odds of us interacting, had it not been for that Vishal sir's project we ended up doing together.

Well it's a shame kaafi people won't realize how much you care about your friends, but never post about it <3
How you are a walking encyclopedia, but never brag about it _/\_
How much you envy your friends not spending enough time with you, but never express about it :(
And how you would remain some of the 'Sabse sahi' people I met on campus, but never talk about it !
