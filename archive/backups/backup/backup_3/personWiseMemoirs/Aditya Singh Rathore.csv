Tum dono roomies me se ek ya to humare room pe hota tha ya fir Deepak aur Shubham ke room par, alag hi scene the tumhare.
Aur bhai mujhe 2nd year tak lagta tha tu nerd hai par uske baad  pta laga ki jalwe hai tere to. Teri stories sunke mai to hairaan reh gya tha. Bada rangeen banda hai tu to, itni cool, funy aur daring kisse expect nahi kiye the terese.
Antaragni me bhi kitna ghoomte the tu, mai aur Dhawal, adventure ki talaash me, zyda adventure to mile nahi par fir bhi maze bahot kiye hai humne.
BBQ aur treats ki bhi bahot acchi memories hai.
Jaldi milte hai aur bakchodi karte hai.
All the best bro, you will get great things.",Aditya Singh Rathore,True,60a66619819323d199d48f89,Aayush  Sharma
1,Bhai Civil Department me sabse hard working aur sabse helping banda tu laga mereko. SOCE se mile the hum aur uske baad humari dosti badhti hi gyi. Tu bahot sincere and honest banda hai aur hamesha aise hi rehna. Touch me rehna hamesha. Lockdown khulte hi milte hai.,Aditya Singh Rathore,True,60a523f3819323d199d48394,Ashutosh  Ranjan
2,"Yoooo TT captain, tu bina ek bhi lecture attend kiye A kaise laati thi, ye ninja technique hume bhi batao kabhi. Aur bahot balchod hai tu, masti karti pure time aur last me chup chap A le aati. 
Milte hai kabhi,aise hi chaapte rehna.",Aditya Singh Rathore,True,60a5e758819323d199d487de,Chitranshi  Singh
3,"First week se hi teri bakchodi to dikh gayi thi. Har senior se pakde jaana aur fir uske baad koi mast song ya joke sunana, banda to tu bada rangeen hai. Waise to hume dusro ke dukh pe hasna nahi chahiye par jab tu ksi ko roast karta tha, wo best entertainment tha. Waise to tu accha singer hai par wo kehte hai na ""excess of anything is harmful"", to 1st year me humare room me tere concert thode excess me ho gye the. But I gotta admit, uss time bhi tu bina practice ke bhi puri tarah se khul ke gaata tha.
Aate hi 2 mahine me pehla EDM aa gya tha aur tabse hi har EDM me jo akhand randaap machaya hai hum chaaro ne, jo moves kiye hai!!! Humare moves ka ksi aur ke paas tod nahi hota tha. Har EDM me tu, mai, Deepak aur Shubham late hi pauche hai, par bhai wo 8.15 se 10 tak ka dance hi bahot bhari workout ho jaata tha. Uske baad events ground jaake bandiyan taadne se pehle wapas canteen se kuch khake aana padhta tha.
Aur summer camp me sabse consistant player tha tu, consistantly late aata tha:) Aur bhai kya gareebo waala khana tha summer camp me Hall 2 mess ka, watermelon ke alwa kuch khane ka mann hi nahi karta tha, par fir bhi tu, mai aur Rajan kitne baar raat 10 tak mess khulwaye rakhte the, mess waale bhi gaali dete honge hume.
Tera jaisa carefree banda nahi dekha, 9.30 tak ke mess timing me 9.40 par breakfast karne jaana, 7 pm ke event ke liye 7.10 par room se nilakna, room par bakchodi karte karte ghar ke liye bus hi miss kar dena, jalwe to tumhare bahot rhe hai.
Bhai teri advice hamesha acchi hoti thi. Day 1 par hi tune mujhe advice di thi middle waala bed na lene ki, par maine fir bhi liya, par uske baad se samajh aa gya tha ki teri advice kaam ki hoti hai. Library me bhi mai 30% time padhta tha, aur 70% time ghumta, sota aur phone chalata, tu hi kehta tha ki padh le bc. Tu behaviour bhi kaafi acche se notice karke mistakes aur unke solution bata deta tha, kaafi help mili hai mujhe tere analysis se.
Humare bagal me rehte the Shubham aur Deepak, mast apni duniya me, bilkul chill aur fir aata tha humara kamra, hum dono hi bhaavanao me dube rehte. Aur issi wajah se Shubham ko hum dono ko har alternate day walk par leke jaana padta tha:)
Bahot ghoome hai mai, tu aur Sbhubham. Aur ghoomne ke saath saath ice cream bhi to khate the. Aur Hall 12 canteen me har weekend khaane jaate the hum teeno, uss din mess me aalu jo hota tha.
Tamonud aur Rajan ko bahot chedha bhi hai par unke saath masti bhi bahot ki hai humne. 
Aur hum dono hi aalsi the, 8-9 ghante sona, dophar me bhi soo jaana, end sem me jagna mushkil hota tha humare liye aur last paper deke aate hi neend jaane kaha gayab ho jaati thi, end sem ke exhaustion ke bavjud puri raat jaag kar ek season khatam kar dete the.
Aur 2nd aur 3rd year me hum running partners bhi to the. PE ground se start karke Director bunglow se hote hue airstrip se hokar aate the. Best track dhundha tha humne. Baarish me to lagta tha Switzerland me bhaag rhe hai.
Uske baad raat me professor's quaters waale area me cycling bhi to karne nikalte the aur uss samay kaafi gehri baatein hoti thi.
 
From being a decent singer in first year to writing, composing and singing your own songs, you have come a long way and the efforts you put in for this are commendable. The hours and hours of sheer hardwork was something not everyone can do. But then, not everyone is Dhawal Raturi.
I can't even imagine the courage it took to let go of the placements and go for your passion of being a musician. Hats off to you and I am already your fan. You are smart, talented and ready to put in the work and for that I believe you'll get everything you have set out to achieve. And when you make it up there, just get us backstage tickets for your concert:)
You are passionate and ambitious and you are gonna have a hell of a life.
I couldn't have asked for a better friend and roommate. 
I won't miss you because we'll always be in touch. 
All the best bro and I really wish you get all that you desire and still more.

4,"Bhai summer camp ke trial ke liye jab tu aaya tha tab laga tha, chalo ab apne saath ek aur 1st year sprint karega, par mujhe kya pta tha tu pehle hi din Dhanowa sir ki chatrachaya me chala jaaega. Par fir bhi bhai, dost mast ho gyi thi apni summer camp me hi, aur hoti kaise na, saare din bakchodi jo karte the. 

Fir teesreaur chauthe sem me bhi humne kaafi collaborate kiya par paachve sem se to alag hi jalwe the humare, saari classes me saath baithna, class ke baad masti, lab me bakchodi, quizzes se pehle randi rona, quiz ke baad bolna, ye hagg di par agli me fod denge....bhai alag hi mauj maari hai humne saath me. 

Aur bhai terese mai bada intimidate ho jaata tha, jab jao bc padh rha hota, subha dekho, Kamboj padh rha hai, shaam me dekho, bc abhi bhi Kamboj padh rha hai. Par saale tu rota bahot hai, wo bhi matlab ka roye to baat hai, bc faaltu me rota rehta, B aa rha hai to bhi rona, saale C laake ke khush rehta tha mai!!!! 

Bhai aise hi hardwoking aur genuine rehna aur chaapte rehna.

6,"You were one of the first people I met at IITK. You were always this nice guy who used to help everyone. Tu aur Shubham the raato ke Shahenshah aur bhai mujhe aati thi 11 baje ke baad neend. Tum dono ke beech waala bed leke maine ye sunishit kar liya tha ki raato ko ab mujhe bhi jagna hai. Bhai 1st semester se hi humne kafi maze kiye aur 2nd semester me saath Galaxy karke to maza hi aa gya tha, par humne mid sem ka kuch nahi padha aur jo jage the na bhai hum uske baad....

Bhai tu atyant cool hai, EDMs me tere dance moves dekh kar to DU waale ( waali I mean) bhi tere fan ho gye the, jo locks and pops maare hai tune. Kabhi bhi boldo tereko ghumne chalne ke liye, tu ready rehta tha hamesha, chahe next day exam hi kyu na ho. Bhai itna enthu aur itni energy laata kaha se tha, saale ek din me 20km kon chal leta hai, Bournvita ke saath aisa kya peeta tha?

Aur chaapu to tu hadd se zyda hai bhai, exam ke pehle party karke A laa rha, kaise!!!! 
Fir chahe CSE courses me A laana ho, Adobe me PPO lena ho ya hackathons me fodna ho, sabme tu aage. 
Aur tere Kishore Kumar, Mukesh aur Rafi ke gaane....bhai room ka radio tha tu, continous background music deta tha, mereko to kabhi kabhi aisi feel aati ki movie me hai hum aur background score chal rha hai.
And I personally feel, there couldn't have been a better CS coordinator than you. Tu ksi ke liye bhi best mentor hai.

Jaldi milte hai aur fir wapas chalte hai raat me ghoomne, kuch khane ke bahane.

13,"When I took the middle bed, the bed between you and Deepak, I had already made sure it was going to be hell of an interesting first year for me. From being roommates to becoming brothers, we grew up. The first time we worked together was when you, me, Deepak and Tamonud participated in Takneek, though Deepak and you did most of the work:)
We were the kings of EDMs. 'Hum chaar', you, me, Dhawal and Deepak never missed an EDM. We were always there, dancing our hearts out, doing the most insane steps. Then we used to go to Events ground . 
For sometime we were even training partners under the self acclaimed 'Best Coach' Dhanowa Sir and he made you do 200+ kg squats:) There were also some fierce badminton battles fought among us when you, me and Deepak faced each other in Room 127 badminton league.
You were always the chill one, the cool dude who never gave a fuck, or atleast that's what most people thought about you. We knew that it was just what you made others believe even though you actually cared a lot.
After Deepak was taken away from us by the Gucci gang, you, me and Dhawal became the three musketeers. Me and Dhawal were the emotional kind, one of us was always feeling low for some reason or the other. You were our saviour, our knight is shining armour, who used to say 'chalo ghumne chalte hai, chaach bhi peeyenge raaste me' and then we used to embark on your bitching journey with chaach in one hand and dark chocolate in another. 
I really enjoyed going to the gym with you, getting all that gym gyaan from you and trying to eat as many eggs as you did.
Tereko swimming bhi sikha dete par tu chala hi nahi humare saath swimming pool.
Geeky Shubham, you were the Technical Guruji for me, you were my go to person when I needed any movie link or any app or needed any help regarding my phone or laptop. 
And your love for MasterChef and anime came as a shock for me, I would have never thought you would be into cooking and anime, cause from starting you were a 'pru' gamer. I hope to see you someday in MasterChef.
You were a great roommmate and are an even better friend.
All the best and I know that you will achieve great things. ",Aditya Singh Rathore,True,60a65330819323d199d48e4a,Shubham
