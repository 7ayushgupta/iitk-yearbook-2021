 I don’t want to belittle the hardships you have faced but instead compliment the bravado you always had to smile through whatever life threw at you.  Since our first year in PE, I have known you, but I feel like I truly came to know you in the last few months we hung out. You are a trustworthy and reliable friend because god knows I have trusted you with my food several times xD. 
 I am glad we became friends, and you are in one of my most treasured memories of campus.  
 PS: My bottle really misses you! ",Avisha,True,60ab8c03659165b3aa644d8b,Avani  Shrivastava
1,"If someone asked me to describe you, I would say- ‘She can talk pink, she can walk pink, she can laugh pink, because pink is her favourite colour.’ I am glad our friendship and camaraderie survived through all the blues that IITK threw at us (yes, your memoir is going to be more than just pink, xD). You have been a constant part of the journey since the first semester, and despite our differences, we always managed to make unforgettable memories here. Crazy cycle rides, beer-sneak incident, midnight mosquito reproduction lectures, and rolling at Nicki Minaj’s music videos, to list a few. 
I have great respect for the support and cheer I got from you all these years. In all four years, I have noticed, your confidence is the best colour on you. Never take it off and be unapologetic you always!

3,"Let's be honest here. We became friends through Pragya, but she was worried your cancerous humour might spread to me, so she didn't let us hang out much. 
So, with the risk of sounding like your dad again,  I would say keep cracking jokes and have fun with life!  ",Avisha,False,60aeae7e659165b3aa644e45,Mayant  Mukul
4,"Hey co-actor!
We had the most absurd first interactions of all. From slapping you four times to you stealing my 'C A P T I O N', I guess college life passed. 
You seem to live life to the fullest so keep doing that give us more funny instagram live videos xD.
Cheers!",Avisha,False,60a8bca9819323d199d493a7,Nihal  Choudhary
5,"I wondered how you always participated in multiple things and still managed to do well in all of them. I will never forget you as the guy who entered the lab 40 minutes late but aced the course in the end. This is a distant memory, but we hosted a terrible DE together where we fell short of adjectives to use :P
Well, it was a little less terrible with you. 
Also, all seemingly drunk texts from my phone were sent by sober me and my sober accomplices xD. 
Cheers!

6,"Please mera dryer wapas dede xD
Cheers to the fun times we had together in the first year. Please keep painting walls and pulling off badass hoodies!",Avisha,False,60aeaf5f659165b3aa644e46,Pratham
7,"Here I was thinking to surprise you by reminding you about the first time we met in your memoir. Well, things don't always go to plan, just like those interviews xD. I remember it didn't take me much time to be comfortable around you. You are kind and make it easy to talk to you. I had a lot of fun with you during the CGS course, where we totally copied our way out. The camaraderie, panicking together till the last minute, hurriedly figuring out our codes, and then framing our defenses when we almost got caught xD, were the most fun times of that semester. 
You always gave a fun and kind vibe. Thanks for all the cheerful times!!",Avisha,True,60ae451c659165b3aa644e2a,Priank  Prasad
8,"Let me begin by quoting our friend Peter Porker- 'How dare you fucking say pleasure?' 
It's funny how our friendship originated from Facebook comments. Knowing you and your humor has been great for me. You have a humble presence which makes it very easy to approach you, even from other people's phones xD.",Avisha,True,60a68669819323d199d490b1,Pulkit  Pandey
9,"I remember the first time we talked was when you suddenly came up to me asking for a picture together on the fresher's night. You were always very straightforward and easy to talk to. I think we were destined to embarrass ourselves since the day we opted for the fashion show. But, it was a little less embarrassing with you people around me. Although we haven't been in touch lately, I cherish our time together in the first year (exchanging waves on messenger :P).",Avisha,True,60a685af819323d199d490ac,Shivam  Arya
