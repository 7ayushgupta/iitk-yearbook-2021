Yes, it’s true that we didn’t start talking during whole 1st year...you know that hagga partition, and also you were too busy in magging...and i was happy ki all your hard work paid off and you changed your department. I came to know you after 1st year when i heard ki, there is a chapu guy in our guy jo dassa se just rh gya...and i don’t know how, but we gradually became friends, and fifa did the rest. And eventually we became very good friends. 
Tumhari kya hi tareef kru bhai...such a gentleman, good at heart, focused, helpful and most importantly always ready to listen to you. I must have done some punya ki i got such good friends. I hope ki our friendship remains forever. We had so much fun at the campus yar...played badminton,volleyball, football together...and yes fifa too...bhai fifa🙏...bhai pura 2 sal barbad kiya hai hmne...always playing fifa...and time mila to thoda padh liye...wrna...eat,play fifa,sleep,repeat😄...but kafi mja aaya tha yar...ek baat bta, itna fifa khelne k bad bhi bhai throughball k alawa kya sikha tu...u are still shit at fifa😜...aur tumhare football skill ki kya hi baat kru..ohhooo...bhai open goal miss krna koi tumse sikhe🙏🙏..but anyway, i always enjoyed playing with you...aur ye kaise bhul skta mai...chess coordi...har jagah chapna koi tumse sikhe...aur bhai 'rishikesh' trip yar...bhut mje aaye the bhai...aur bhi trip plan kro yar...and haa, iss bar tu sponsor krega mujhe!...anyway brother, i truly had a great time with you at campus.
Thankyou for being the most memorable part of my life. I truly respect you man. aur  haa, first salary se ek badhiya gaming laptop khridna...aur fifa bhi...and yes, i have started playing chess now, thode tricks bta dena...all the best...keep your hunger of success intact...love u 💖💖...be safe and take care!",Mukesh  Kumar,True,60a6589b819323d199d48e98,Ayush  Goel
1,"Hi Pandey..hope u have moved on by now. I didn’t want to write anything about you after what you have done😠(those who know, know it), but tum dil k kafi achhe aadmi ho❤️. Also, I know that it was your last possible chance, so I forgive you. I can write a whole page on this topic..you know that...but i will maintain the dignity of memoir and epsilon amount of  your ijjat. 
We didn’t talk even once during our 1st year, cause you were maggu at that time...baat krne  k liye kha hi time tha tere pas...and at that time, mere ko ye bilkul ye nhi lga ki we will become such a good friend. From the time I know you, you were the most chillest person of our wing, and ofc Chapu. Do u remember, tumhare pas kafi stories hoti thi , and u needed someone to spill it out. And then you come to most vella guy of the wing, who had always time for others (ofc it was me). That was the time when we got along and the strength of our friendship increased, if u remember. I really enjoyed those stories man (just say thanks from my side to the main storyteller). do u remember, ek din mera laptop aur notebook sb le liye the..just bcz i was not ready to listen to your stories...agle subah quiz thi...b**k aise harkate mt kiya kro, nhi to koi suplex deke chala jayega.I know i hit u once, i’m really sorry for this...but kya mja aaya tha yar...aisa lga i’m in wwe ring, and i’m giving you superman punch. Even after this, we are such a good friend. But i have to ask you a question. Why you always betray me??chahe wo fluid mechanics ki endsem ho ya placement session ho...why??? jaise bhi ho bhai...but tum dil k kafi achhe ho...and it’s very difficult to find people with a good heart...mai khud ko kafi lucky manta hu ki i got friends like you...playing full night badminton and volleyball...wo bhi kya din the..i really miss those days yar...and yes we haven’t gone to any trip together, but next time be ready...to sponsor my trip!😍(JPMC k itne paise ka kya krega). So, thank you for making my life at campus more beautiful and memorable bhai. There is a quote “Hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst”. ‘Worst’ to tumhare sath ho hi chuka hai, now its time for the best. So, All the best for your future ahead.

2,"Hii Baby…
Literally the coolest guy I have ever met...bhai tere wo moves during the birthdays and ofc on the fresher’s night...you killed it man. You are the reason that I am watching the most-watched and most thrilling sports of the world..first time fifa maine tere hi dabbe pe khela tha (if u remember). so, the credit of me playing fifa also goes to you. Along with these all, suddenly i got to know ki tune nahla mar diya...wo bhi bina magai k...i mean how can someone be so cool and chapu at the same time. Respect man🙏🙏. Bhai kuchh time bad to...fifa was a stress buster for me...whenever i got stressed...mai tujhe hi dhundhta tha..kratik ko dekha kya?? 😂(to play fifa)...there came a time i used to beat everyone in fifa except one guy...yes, it’s u...cmon man, how can u play so simple and elegant football...no wonder, u r a pep fan😜...yad hai wo eso203 class wali incident 😆...kya epic reaction tha wo yar...mtlb you made the whole class laugh...this will always be the most memorable part, along with the “Rishikesh’ trip. Phle pta nhi chla hoga, but you must know by this trip ki how much i trust you. Thanks for the safe driving baby. Kash tu ‘Nainital’ trip pe hota...you know, when i had an accident there, the first person i remember just after the accident was you...kash tu hota to mai bach jata. Anyway bro...we have long life ahead and many many trips to come.
Just listen one thing baby, sam is mine...najar bhi mt daliyo ispe😡...warna world war-iii is not that far😂... You,sameer and mugal will always be in my heart...just let me in, and change it from ‘trio forever’ to ‘chaukdi forever’❤️. Sorry for not coming to the Goa trip. Next trip pe pakka i’m in. aur jb bhi milo, don’t forget to teach me some of your cool moves. love u bhai💓💓, and good luck for your future. and don't forget the Qatar trip.

3,"RAJABABU….You better keep this name...last name k liye struggle nhi krna pdega...it’s ‘RAJA’ and “BABU” 😝 and RAEES to tu hai hi...Bhai, we are from same city, same department, almost same cpi (i know u are on the other side of the attha ki boundaryline, but still), and most importantly, same enthu to defend our state😂. Right from the beginning of college time, that one person who was always with me was you. I really feel very very lucky that you came in my life, and filled it with more and more joy and happiness.
You are the reason that I explored so much in these 4 years...chahe wo gym me paise barbad krne ho ya swimming me 😂...jokes apart, but you are the most kind-hearted and supportive person among all of my college friends. Bhai, kitne courses to tune smbhala hai...warna pta nhi kitne repeat krne pdte, pta nhi kitne quizzes miss hote. So thank you for all of this...and yes how can i forget that Control System paper...bhai itni daring🙏...dude, you showed me your answer sheet in front of the TAs...who does that!!! The most unforgettable memory will always be the ‘Rishikesh’ trip...we had so much fun there, yes Thank you for sponsoring me🤗...And who will forget our ‘Nainital Trip’...that accident bro(at around 6000 feet height)...still haunts me...I should have trusted your driving skills man...but all of them was fun. We enjoyed it. Also, during the last month of our college time, dare to message a random chapu girl on insta, and getting her on video calls within two f**king days, r u kidding me!! dude, i respect you 3000x now.
The last one and half month was not good for me. I got my foot fractured and I couldn't even walk. During these tough days, that amount of help and support bhai...I really owe you man (not money 🤪)...Thank you so much for all your help. We didn’t have our last photo together unfortunately, but I am coming to bangalore...macha denge bhai!
These four years were really amazing...IITK has given me a lot of things, but you are the most precious one. I really wish that our friendship remains forever. I just wish you good luck and achieve whatever you want to. Aur haa, foreign mt chale jana. IAS bano...and do something for our city, our state, and our country...They really need you. Best of luck for you journey ahead.

4,"Hi Lambiii...ab khush n...so many calls(bhai likh diyo memoir yar)...ofc i will write bro, i mean how can i forget to write to the person who made my college life  more awesome...chahe wo sath me volleyball khelna ho (saying mukku bhai….pichhe ka pura smbhal liyo😂), wo badminton tournament khelna ho ( jo tu kbhi jeeta nhi😀), ya fir raat raat bhar cards khelne ho...aur bhai cards game ko leke itna senti kyo hote ho bhai...it’s just a game..and one more thing, bhai tu game me cheating krna kb chhodega...anyway, it was all fun yar. Aur thanks bhai for all those movie recommendations...whenever i wonder for the movie to watch, suddenly you appear...mukku bhai kya kr rha...movie dekhne ka soch rha hu...recommend kr n, and that’s it...but ek baat bta, anime se tujhe itni affection kyo hai bhai...why? U better recommend me the best one to start...and yes, bhai tumhe itne tv-series kyo dekhne hai...wo bhi kafi lambi...bhai ruka ja,warna aankhe bahar nikal aayegi 😂...koi nhi, isse atleast hme ye to pta to chal jata tha kaun si movies ya tv-series nhi dekhni chahiye😜.
aur haa bhai...it might sound cliche, but you are like Nariyal... upar se jitne kathor, andar se khi jyada soft and sweet❤️. Aapn dono kitni bar jhagad chuke hai bhai...but after sometime, sbkuchh phle jaisa, infact better...I think our bonding gets stronger every time we fight...should we continue doing this🤪...anyway, you are really too sweet man❤️...aur bhai tu jo itna sports khelta hai, 1st year cricket, 2nd year volleyball, and finally became captain of volleyball...bhai tu galat jagah aa gya, u should have pursued your career in some sports...itna kuchh krte hue bhai nahla🙏.
Aur finally, placement me bhi chap diye bhai...it’s OYO baby...Cheers🍷...bhai oyo me bs 2 chijo pe dhyan diyo...phla apne kam pe...aur dusra dosto k liye available rooms pe...aur bhai, piyush se kuchh sikh, time aur chutiya dono mt ktwa...and yes never quit your primary job of sending messages to random girls😂😂.

5,"How should i start?? Calling you a culer, my FIFA partner, or chapu, or the overconfident guy, or a kattar maharashtrian😜, or Baby?? I’ll start with the last one.
Hi Baby💓...i have called you the whole college time by this, i still call you by this, and will be calling you by this...hope u don’t get offended 🤪, like i used to get whenever you said something bad about Bihar😂. I don’t precisely remember how we started talking, probably during Antaragni when we all(wingies) went together. But, by 2nd sem, we were friends. During the 2nd sem, i don’t think we talked much apart from the aceds discussion, but our bonding started to increase when we went to ‘Rishikesh’ trip. We got to know each other better during the trip, and ofc we had a blast there. I also got to know that under 200 rank wale log bhi can be a real superchill guy🤘. Lekin bhai tujhe mere state se itna hate kyo hai bhai(laughing emoji), the people here are so good man. Pta nhi kitni bar nok jhok ho chuki hai hum dono k bich me, bihar k topic ko lekar. But do you know why our friendship continued even after so many nok jhok, bcz you are most sweetest guy. You are so good man. I know mai kafi bar offend bhi ho jata tha, but bhai tu thoda stats ki jankari rkha kr. Aur bhai tera confidence, bhai tere ghar me confidence k trees hai kya??? Itna kaise bhai...but this is what makes you unique...’the confidence of being an overconfident’. Don’t get affected by someone else, just be you. You are much better than what others think of you.
But bhai, ye FIFA ne jo bonding badhayi hai n hmari🙏...all thanks to FIFA...do u remember, how we used to play FIFA whole night...lunch miss...dinner miss...then raat ko roll order kro...puri raat khelo...subah quiz hai, kuchh nhi padha...fir bhi m** c****ye quiz..let’s play FIFA...it was crazy bro...you were so competitive bro😍...and bhai tujhe harake jo mja aata tha n...kya btau ….we played so many league matches yar...completing whole league matches in 2 days…(yad hai?maine arsenal liya tha, you took man city, and goel took man utd--his affection towards Lukaku😂)...we were insane bro...but bhai bhut mje aate the yar…those were the golden days yar, and i feel sad that those days are gone. Humlogon ne itna FIFA khela ki pta hi nhi chala ki when we became best friends from good friends.
 And, yes I consider myself very very lucky that I got a friend like you. You made my college life more amazing and exciting.I hope our friendship remains forever. I just don’t want to lose you man. And I’m sorry, mai goa trip pe nhi aa paya..but next trip plan kr, and consider me ‘in’ by default.Wish you a very bright future ahead. Also, I wish ki Messi doesn’t retire until you meet him..Andha paisa kmao...Meet your idol...and hme bhi milwao...I want to see how inhuman looks like, and will get some pictures with him.

6,"Hello Anshu (pet name revealed)..
Bhai, I just can’t imagine it’s been 7 years of friendship..and I wish ki it remains forever❤️. It is very difficult for any friendship to go so long. We both are very thankful to god that everything happened in our favour. I came to know you during our JEE preparations at FIITJEE. Initially I thought...ya, seems like a nice guy...started talking...and eventually became good friends while helping each other in solving fiitjee booklets. U remember anshu? that fight between us...MTH publication k book ko leke...i refused to give it to you, and u stopped talking to me...was kidding man😂...and then we became very good friends. This made me realise ki with whoever i had a little nok jhok , they became very good friends of mine (kyo pandey aur piyush 😂). We got so lucky bhai….same batch at FIITJEE, both repeated for JEE, again got in the same institute and batch(Parth Ranker ROCKS(rock emoji)), and fortunately got in the same college and even the same hall bhai💗...everything happened in favor of our friendship. And I feel very lucky that you are one of my friends, and trust me, you have a very special place in my life🤗. I mean it needs a lot of effort to maintain any type of relationship, and I respect you a lot for all your efforts to keep our friendship going. 
This whole memoir would be like green trees but with no fruits if I don’t talk about our college life. You made these whole four years of college life really awesome by showing us your writing skill. Bhai mera SHAYAR..kasam se yar...kya likhte ho bhai..ekdum gaddar...I had only listend earlier ki “PYAR ME LOG SHAYAR BN JATE HAI”, but you made me believe it. Here is a two-liner that came in my mind spontaneously, hope u like it:
Ek tum aur tera adhoora pyar, i wish ki it happens bar bar;
You might not want it to happen again, but trust me, this will be the reason for your name and fame!
I just can’t wait to see you on youtube and your book to be a bestseller in India...macha dena bhai! 
And yes, thank you for being there whenever I needed someone. Whenever I was in a confusion for choosing or doing something or not, you were the first person who I went to. And, ofc how can we both forget that traumatic period of my life😢...man i just can’t tell how i would have been if u were not there. I am really really thankful to you bhai. And thanks to you for making me start all the nashe things😜...it really feels amazing. Kuchh nashe bache hai, but i know ki tu uski bhi aadat lgwa dega. But, how could I forget that Nainital trip man. Bhai, mai maut ko takk se choo k wapas aa gya tha...it was scary..but i really enjoyed it man. The funniest trip was our regular Patna trip. Sutta fukna at every Patna trip. Jb bhi tum patna aate the, ek lambi list hoti thi tumhare pas, of all the street-food and their locations.Jha bhi jao, ‘paisa wasool’ ki responsibility tum lete the. Bhai, to ek din bhukha aata tha, paisa wasool krne k liye. and ghar jakar pta chlta tha ki you have gained 5 kgs of weight...i mean are you for real??? And itne khane wale bnde ko achanak se diet follow krna, i can’t believe my eyes. Jo bhi ho, you are following it strictly, and yes huge respect for this. Aur bhai, wo 85 kg wali bet ko jyada serious mt le yar, gareeb aadmi ko jeene nhi doge kya😂. The most hilarious and memorable trip to Patna was of course Jan’21. First of all, you should thank me for making you lose your weights, and saving your auto ka kiraya😜. We did so much kand bhai...you know that! 
Last but not the least, I wish you very very good luck for your great journey ahead. I hope you fulfill all your dreams, and most importantly follow your diet, cause the ‘BET’ is still ON.

Thanks me to not starting with g******d😆...I don’t really remember how we talked first time (pakka wo aapka koi gyan session hoga😂), but we were among our 12 brothers, we were meant to be friends. Mujhe sach me nhi pta tha ki we would become such good friends, and i am glad ki one more very good friend gets added in my life, and i really meant it. 
Of course you were an integral part of my life at campus, whenever i felt low or lgta tha ki yar kuchh achha nhi lg rha, pta nhi kya chal rha life me, there was always a gyani baba there for me. And thanks for always being there. One best thing about you ki you try to listen people (not like me 😂), and easily understand what others want to say. So, just keep it. We also played badminton together so much bhai...and ofc cards...bhai pagal hi ho gye the hmlog card k pichhe...bro dinner ho gya? Let’s play cards...and played it till 2’o clock...bro sach bta rha hu...sleep-cycle bigad chuka tha mera...and who wants to miss yours and piyush’s discussion over the real life issues of India...pta nhi chlta tha kb time nikal gya...and for me, listening to this was really worth it. Kafi kuchh sikhne ko milta tha...and i would be happy to see you as an IAS officer. Our country needs people with such a broad vision. Aur haa bhai, wo placement session...bhai ekdum chaap diye the bhai...i was surprised as well as happy ki u did it on day1...sare 9 pointer walo ki band bjate hue…cheers for that🍸.
So, thankyou for being such an inspiring person in my life, and i know there are a lot of people out there who will get inspired by you. I really wish ki u get selected in very first attempt. And best of luck for your great journey ahead. Do whatever you want to do...love u bhai💓...take care!
