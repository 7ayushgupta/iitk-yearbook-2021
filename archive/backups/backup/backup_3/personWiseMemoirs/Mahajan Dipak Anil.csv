I can't describe in words how awesome person you are!! A great combination of sweet yet savage, shy but a good roaster, sensitive and emotionally strong, nervous at times still chapu!! I won't forget the times when you roasted rahul lmao!! Those were some savage replies. I won't forget that one time either when you were feeling bad for scolding few AMs for not working and you got so emotional for doing that you were having second thoughts about that. Bhai itna sweet toh Digu bhi nai hai (sorry digu :p but that's the truth). Yaar aisehi raho hamesha!! You're an awesome person and I am grateful that I got a chance to meet you!! You help a lot of people around you and always life their spirits. Thanks for being there !!

Aur Bhai Adi!! Hopefully abhi BT khatm ho gayi hogi zindagi ki kaafi had tk!! I was really happy the day I got to know youve sorted things out!! I know it had been hard for you for nearly a year but you made it through anyway!! I still remember the zumba in the orientation, when most of the people around us were not exactly interested in dancing and then there were us - OAT ke sabse last wali seedhi pe jo saath me naache the bakchodi me that was a very nice evening. I could enjoy that because of you man cause I know for sure akela toh nahi hi naachne wala tha mai kisibhi haalat me xD. Thanks for that!! I also remember that ome time you encouraged me to come to the tracks with you foe the runs and made me go for a run in the mornings too. I remember the countless times we turned the lights of our room in the night because seniors were in the wing. I remember those failed attempts at waking people up in the mornimg kust for breakfast. I remember that annoying samsung alarm which used to wake us up for the PE101 sessions. I remember the EDM nights that we attended together and had loads of fun. 
Thank you for all these memories!! All the best for your future!! Love you man!! ",Mahajan Dipak Anil,True,60a3017e819323d199d47e5f,Aditya Singh Rathore

Bhai bahot si memories judi hai yaar tumhare saath!! Regarding the night when the third yearites caught us, I too felt the same way lol!! I was shit scared what would happen and shayad mere chehre se dikh bhi rha hoga but still it was a fun night. Do know that I was looking forward to dance to rocky/disco song and certainly not a slow arijit singh song 😛. I had spent two years of my life in kota away from my home but somehow in the initial days i was still feeling a bit homesick. This was in the very beginning of the orientation and I didn't know kaise logon se milunga and kya hoga aage. But you did a very good job on distracting me from these thoughts of homesickness and making me focus on the fun part of college life instead. I will never forget the roasts of the people( mostly tamonud and divyanshu ). Tum kaafi mazedaar insaan ho bhai!! Gaana gaa lete ho, poems likh lete ho, bakchod writing skills, mathematics strong hai, basketball khel lete jo itna bakchod, funny ho kaafi(ngl I still laugh at the story of 'kiski **** me kitne **** aaj ginega deepak **** sometimes).

And yet there were many times when you helped me even during the hardest semester of CSE. Thanks man!! You really made life easier at some incidents. Thanks for everything. All the best for future endeavours. Chapu toh ho hi tum aur chapoge aage bhi ye bhi pata hai.

Bahot chaapu ho bhai tum. Damn man, it was one heck of a journey that we had together. There were lows, highs, HIGHs and what not. From spending the darkest semester together to having fun together in the last one month at iitk it was a very nimce journey - a really special one. I will never forget that journey. Thank you for being there throughout the journey, thanks for being there when I needed someone. Damn I remember we started bonding by being project partner in CSE courses and damn we did a lot of course assignments, projects together. Thanks for covering up for me when I was not contributing well in some of the projects. All the best for your future bro. I know it is going to be awesome and you are going to achieve great things kyunki tum utne chapu ho and you will do it, for sure!! Love you man!!

You're the best room mate I could ever have 😉!! First year ke baad wala summer yaad aa rha hai mujhe jab raat raat room pe jaag ke PUBG khelte the !! Phir beech me break ke naam pe canteen ya phir cathi rolls jaate the !! Damn first was good, cycle nikal ke campus ki sair, raat me airstrip ke side pe shaanti + hawa + neel gaay ka dar lol !! Wo raat ke trips ne kaafi saari memories di hai!! Not gonna lie - it was one of the best times I've had in IIT K and thanks for making that time special!! Saath me ACA project bhi kara tha apan ne 😛!! Room shift hone ke baad pehle dusre wing jaake lightein aur chair dhundke apna room set karna bhi yaad rahega xD!!! Second year me room me do aur laundo paal kar rakhe the wo bhi yaad rahega!! Now that I think about it there are a lot of memories. Ab yaha pe lamba nibandh toh nai likhunga but we both will have them memories till death and they will surely make us happy !! Thanks for teaching me the abc of piracy, thanks for introducing me to EDMs, thanks for the lots of tips and tricks to make life easier, thanks for everything !!

the Based Chairperson Gang,
Vrooooooooooooooo!!!!!
You're the wisest homie out of all the homies and ngl I really got to learn a lot from you. A wise man once said ""you should not call someone your best friend because then you are comparing your friends and that is not good"".  Ironically, the very first line of this memoir compares you with other people but okay. you are really a very awesome person and I am grateful that I got a chance to meet you in my life. I remember we met for the first time in first year summers lol. It was the phy103 AM thingy on which we worked together. I hate that we did not get to hang out in the last month of iitk. But hey, Gurgaon aur Noida ke beech kitna hi fasla hai lol. I really like how I could easily message you regarding how the Y18 is fucked up in ESC and we should do something and how easily we went on board and actually helped them. Thanks, for everything. All the best for the future endeavours. Love you <3. ",Mahajan Dipak Anil,True,60a43d4f819323d199d4810c,Yash  Maheshwari

75,"Hehe bro, 
ye memoir me kya hi likhu ab samajh nai aa rha. Jab bhi kuch kehna hota hai tumse mai toh seedha keh deta hu tumhe dont think aisa kuch hoga jo nahi keh paaya hounga. Thanks for giving me that space and trusting me at the same time. I remember that one time when you sensed that I might be overthinking things and might be in the guilt that I have messed up things. You knew I might be hurting myself just by overthinking on that and you sent me the most comforting text one could possibly send at that time. tbh I was really really scared at that time and you helped me. Life is weird no? Sometimes we help people and we think that it is a very small thing for us but it really means a lot to them. Thanks for that. Well this was just one incident, I think there a lot more incidents where you helped me when I wasn't doing okay, Even lockdown ke time me you were one of the very few people jinse meri har roz baat hoti thi and I think uska reason bhi obvious hai. You end up where you find most comfortable.  Thanks for existing. Thanks for everything. I will never forget the antaragni nights when we scrolled tinder together, the nights in sixth semester when we bonded and opened up to each other, that one whole night when we shared the gossips, the days when we planned out things together, the last night when you gave me that letter and other countless occasions. It was a very wonderful journey. A journey holistic journey in fact. I really enjoyed the journey and I hope you enjoyed it too!! Thanks for making it special. You are one of the few people I go to whenever I do not feel good and yet everytime you make me feel great about myself. Thanks for existing. I really hope we get to meet soon and complete all the pending pawris. All the best!! Also, I believe in you, no matter what other people say - I know you are a wonderful person and you  will achieve great things in life. Congratulations future Yashika for all the success!! Love you!!
