1,"Hey man! It's been so long... I remember our techkriti hangout. When everyone was busy at the events ground, we were roaming around the peaceful campus clicking stupid pictures and doing crazy shit. It was one of the greatest drunken night-outs. Then there were those random all-nighters where we found ourselves talking about the meaning of life and purpose and love. They were beautiful. 

I always loved how you put all those posters in your room, then gave such a positive vibe. Infact they inspired me to put posters and sticky notes in my room.

P.S. Do you remember that crazy movie night in the Lucknow hotel? ",Chirag  Kapoor,True,60a8f11f819323d199d493cf,Pankaj  Kumar
2,"こんにちはプラギャくん!

AniSoc, now a club is something I kept wishing to be a part of since I came to IITK, albeit you were the closest I got to it. Anime brought us both to FLP, and that's what started our friendship. I'm glad I had your awesome company during FLP, along with Avinash and Rashmi senpai. 

Our stop-motion collab never came to life, though it was fantastic in my imaginations. Maybe one day while scrolling FB or insta we might see something. Cheers to that hope :) ",Chirag  Kapoor,True,60a8ee7a819323d199d493cc,Pragya  Patel
3,"Hello! We, the dual degree peeps, are being forced to write memoirs to each other when these could be so much more senti when we really were leaving the campus. It's tough to put my mind to think this is going to our last meet, and so let me write to our three years of friendship. 

Since you didn't remember how our friendship started, I'll let you know. It began with the Macro-I graph assignment. Vaibhav told you I am a nerd for excel/sheets graph, and you came to me for help. Then I came to you for notes and stuff, and that started our journey. 

I have always seen you as an ambitious girl who has successfully cleared what life had to throw at her. You are different from most people and in a good way. We don't have many memories yet except for studying together to start taking the same courses and finally having the same thesis. Our path keeps converging. 

Let's see where the future takes us. Destiny is all xD.",Chirag  Kapoor,True,60a616c8819323d199d48a42,Ritika  Ajmera
