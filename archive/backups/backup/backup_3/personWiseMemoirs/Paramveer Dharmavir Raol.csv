1,"Definition of OG. Tujhse milne ser pehle never thought bihari attitude cool ho sakta hai but bhi tune mera opinion bilkul change kar diya. Finally jab maine tere JEE see phele ki kahaniyaan suni bhi respect alag lvl tak pahuch gaya. Ek hoti hai seedhi line dusri tedhi fir aata hai Abhishek I mean seriosuly 11th kota, 12th ghar par fir 13th me lets see 🤔 kota ke saare coaching classes me 😅, aur fir end me SCORE apni firend ki aur se dena :-O .

2,"hi bro, hate you for the rumours that you started 😤, they still haunt me. Hate you for the constant disagreement, on lets see 🤔 EVERYTHING. Just wanted to say some things :pre-destination is not all that gr8 and forest gump is a gr8 movie. I can feel the anxiety ad irritation that just went through you after reading that last statement 😅, mereko bahut maza aaya. I didn't have a brother but guess he would be like you constantly dis-agreeing, spreading rumors and annoying me. In sab cheezo ke bavajud tere saath time spend karne me maza aata that and hoping ki vapas Delhi me milenge. BC last statement ka double meaning mat nikalna 😡. 

Aage milenge and I think mai safely keh sakta hu ki you were the best rommie ever. Although the list is very small 😂, sorry I need to get the last word especially with you. ",Paramveer Dharmavir Raol,True,60a120c0819323d199d47c01,Aditya  Raghuwanshi
3,"Hi bro, as for the GPL(that couldn't happen) I consider it one of my biggest achievements.  Man karta hai ki usse resume ke miscellaneous section me likhu 😂. Any ways maza aaya bhai I also hope ki mai campus aa sakta. Par laga raha hai apan jaldi milenge aur tab maza aayega becauz thats what happens when you are in the company of ""Amrendra"". Praying ki tujhe noida mile  🙏🏻. And haan ye Prahant vale joke ka badla zarur lunga 😤.",Paramveer Dharmavir Raol,True,60a11170819323d199d47be3,Amrendra Pratap Singh
4,"Hi bro, thanks for everything the help, the constant motivation, sorry kahi bar frustrate kiya but promise karta hu aaga bhi karunga 🤣 ( Not as much as AMAN :) ). Wierdly I am at loss of words for you, usually I gotta a lot of em for u 😏. Pretty sure sarthak last statement ka double meaning nikalega but 😔. Any ways thanks for everything lagta hai mere BTech ki degree pe 3 naam hone chahiye tera, mera aur sarthak ka 😅. Hoping and praying the best for you and your future. Haan and koi friend mile to hamara  itnro karvana aap us department me expert hai aur ham single hai. Last statement knowingly abmigious rakha hai taki tu aur sarthak double meaning nikal sako. #NostalgicFeeling

5,"Seriously the only way to describe you is EPIC. I mean 3 mahine hi interact kiya that apan ne but bro jo maza aaya. The private group jaha apan shiv aur ayush ke memes banate the, raat ke discussions, the final presentation and the next recording that was full of mentors' roasting and galliyan😂 I know my constant annoying calling for the smallest things was also one of them but hey no regrets 😏... Finally the day when you slept during the meeting and were snoring was the day when your place as OG was cemented in my head.  Bro matlab cool, chill, balanced way me kaam karna ka living example hai to mere liye.. I hope I can emulate 1/2 of your swag. 

I mean seriously the actual internship experience with u was so wonderful (except the working part 😅) that what would of been soch ke rona aa jata hai.    ",Paramveer Dharmavir Raol,True,60a66ca1819323d199d48fcb,Anirudh Anil Ojha
6,"mast dp hai bhai and awesom write-up. From kota till now you are easily one of the most nicest and approachable person till date. I was intimidated by the TP01 students at first but uske baad jaise naturally tere saath bate hone lagi and campus me sane ke baad jaise dost badhti hi gaya. I know I am sorta of an introvert but u always took the first step to interact, and organize get to gathers and that like literally helped to keep in touch with the kota mates. Thanx for that and haan mite hai jaldi, aap organize karna 😅. ",Paramveer Dharmavir Raol,True,60a64da2819323d199d48de3,Archit  Awasthi
7,"Hi bro, can't remeber the first time that I met you. But I mean first year me Japan itni baar saath me ghumte rehte the I don't expect ki mai yaad bhi kar paunga 😅.

8,"Hi bro, jo likhu kam padega, itne zyada yaade hai ki dimmag ke memory unhe hold nahi kar sakti. This gonna sound ironic but SAHI se fraud marna aur mehnet karna done maine tujh se sikha hai 🤣. Jo bhi assignment maine tere saath kiye hai weather you were my group member or not, lagata hai ki uss assigment se maine kahi guna zyada seekha hai just but your presence. Bhai aur kitni bhi tense situation kyu naa ho tere-se baat kane ke baad ek alag saa perspective milta hai. You are like Mr. Miyagi always zen with wise vision.Am really gonna miss u.. 

PS: Re-read karne ke baad lag raha maine tujhe mentor type portray kar diya hai 🤣, Just saying you are more like friend.. like an AWESOME friend. Sorry but edit karne ka mood nahi hai kya karu 633 ke baad tujhse hi edit karya karta that soo...😅",Paramveer Dharmavir Raol,False,60a4fbaa819323d199d482d2,Baldip Singh Bijlani
9,"hi deb, i don't think I was that serious I mean you are the gold standard 😅. I know apan saath me majhe nahi kar paaye but am pretty sure maza aata. Seriously bro baafi cheeze sikhi tujhse, not even kidding. I mean 3 mahne virtually hi mile the but am pretty sure ki vapas kabhi mile to kaafi gappe marenge. Bhai matlab virtually milne ke bavajood lag raha that jaise actually mile liye the, remember the bakchodis of the private group, Anirudh's sleeping and the final presentation recording jaha apan ne jee khol kar galiyaan di this 😂 , bhai current experience hi itna mast that ki what would have been if it were not for the pandemic soch kar rona aa jata hai 😥.  Hoping to meet you soon...

10,"Hi bro, mast memoir likha hai. Tujhe itne time se janata hu ki kabhi kabhi kisi site like fb, insta pe teri request aati hai yaa fir mai bhejta hu to wired saa lagata hai  😂. I mean seriously kota me saath me the, fir kanpur me same wing me the, aur ab suna hai ki teri bhi location noida hai. Kabhi kabhi question kare lagta hu ki real-life hai koi movie ki script 😄 .

11,"Bhai matlab the first thing that comes to mind when I think about you is CREATIVITY. Mai seriously remember nahi kar paa raha ki apan first time kab, kaha aur kaise milte the.  Itna easily mil-ghul gaya that hogaya tha ki pata hi nahi chala ig the guju-guju bond was also a factor. Remeber the time when my family was going to move to surat and I talked with you 😅. I know I did not look all that excited but the first thing that crossed my mind when my father told me was ""Modi see milenge"" sach keh raha hu.

Mai sad that jab finalize nahi hua vo sab 😩, but fir bhai jab tera expression dekha to laga jaise tu mere see bhi zyada sad that 😅. Seriouly bro jeena koi tere see seekhe. Jaldi milte hai.. 

PS: I know kehne ki zarurat nahi hai but raise hi rehna 🥰 .

12,"Ball kabhi fast nahi thi 😅. Any ways but thanx for always giving me the tips. Bhai handsome part is debatable but jab application ki baari aati hai tab aap see bad pro koi nahi. 
Can say without a doubt u are the coolest person I've met till date. I mean proof ke liye teri dp hi kaafi and the first memoir of amrendra. ""Suprise Mother******"" jaise screen tod ke bhar nikata hai. Those are the perfect things to describe u.

14,"Hi bro, I really don't remember the first time I met you, tune bola phy ke liye mile the but ig maine wing me tereko kaafi baar aise hi mila that minor si baate kari thi. Shayad tab le ke ab take itni baar interact kar diya hai ki origin hi bhool gaya hu 😅. I seriously don't know sab log apan ko kyu chidane lage. But considering ki in sab chutkule  ke baad bhi apan ek dusre ki memoirs pe likh rahe hai proves that apni freindship hamesha chalti rahegi. Becuaz apan ne naa jane kitne difficult scenarious ie. SAARE wing ke taano ko seh liya hai 😅.  Preety sure agar log padhenge to iska double meaning nikalenge 😣. But fir mai kuch bhi likhu vo viaise bhi nikalne hi vale the so 😕... Milte hai bro.

First year see lekar last sem take before the apocalypse 😅 I don't remember a second (except acads ) jab mai time pass kar raha hu aur tu naa ho (I know tu soch raha hoga ""except acads"" ke baad there wasn't too much time 😅 but still). Ironic but I always loved playing any sports with you but I hate loosing 😅 and boy that was most of the time . Mujhe pata hai ki tu abhi bol raha hoga ki that was ever time but I remember 1 set of TT jaha mai jeeta that 😅 and you can believe me since I am not AMAN. Hope apan jaldi milege get..
