0,"Thank you for always helping me out. Oat and acad area wali walk, Antaragni nights, Goa ki flight me cringe bollywood movie dekhna, Hall 13 canteen me milna every fucking time (still don't understand kya telepathy thi) and teri last day ki poem, made me cry. Wish to create more memories with you. Let's plan a trip soon. Till then, take care!

1,"You cannot imagine the satisfaction I have that we're going to spend more time together and this was not the end because we started to bond last months me hi. We had so much fun together holi party, photoshoots, games and wo prop wali party. Still can't believe you were high on sleep that day but managed to rock the dance floor! 
There was a time when night out ke baad I would just hope ki Ananya jagi ho. You will always be my breakfast buddy! Can't wait to see you again in Amex and cook breakfast together this time ❤️

And yes, I give you the freedom to believe my love life exists because of you but nvm you already believe it 😂

2,"Anchal bro! I could survive Techkriti because of you. Beech me when you stopped coming to hall 1 and was planning to leave, it scared the shit out of me. It would've been impossible without you. Hall 13 ka illegal stay, chowpatty me pav bhaji and spring rolls, holi party, planning tech summit with you, complaining about the existence of hall 1, bitching about almost all the team members, I had so much fun with you! Will never forget how we used to wander around for dinner and jahan Raghav dikh jate the unse treat le lete the. I am really glad to be the first person who got you drunk. You were so damn cute drink karne ke baad. I wish we could have more such parties. Photoshoot was all about you and me I guess? :P perfectly match karke gaye the. Let's plan a trip soon. I need to see more of bhand Anchal. Love you loads. ❤️

3,"Cannot describe, cannot express, Cannot put it in words what you mean to me. You are my sister, my soulmate, my best friend, and everything. Thank you for just existing and keeping me alive through my hardest days. I will never forget how we would look at each other in a room full of people and understand the mood, and it would just be enough knowing that you were there. Whenever it’s 2:00 am, I still imagine that you’d knock on my door, and we would talk for hours about literally everything. I love you so much. Looking forward to many more years of friendship. Baki call pe <3

4,"Anuj yaar. Hum first year ke baad touch me kyun nahi the? I'm really glad ki mai Techkriti me ayi and tujhse dosti hui. You are a trustworthy person and an amazing friend. 

Itni memories hai tere sath. Techkriti ka holi celebration, team meetings ke baad rant or bitching karna 😂, daru parties (although sirf do hi ho payi and I regret missing tera or Nimish ka Shiv ji moment), tech summit plan karna, had so much fun with you dance club wali party me bhi. And finally ek achhi pic aa gyi apni photoshoot me.  

I am looking forward to awkward Art105 and Techkriti group video calls. And I hope that someday our trip plans will get executed. Till then, take care <3

6,"Start kahan se karu pta nahi. I have countless memories with you! Same batch in Allen, same college, same intern, and Antaragni oof! Could we BE any more similar? I still love the idea of going on a trip just you and me like we planned because yes we are enough. From being there for each other in JEE preparations to wiping each other’s tears in the worst heartbreaks, we’ve seen a lot together. We grew together and we grew apart. And yeah I am not giving up on our dream about settling in the same city. I can say without a blink that you are a constant in my life. Love you!

7,"You fashion diva! Thanks for the earrings and your orange top. I wish we were good friends when we went to Pondicherry tab we barely talked but it would be so much more fun to go on a trip with you now and smoke joints but this time without you testing positive the very next day. We couldn’t have that daru party jisme Jai lane wala tha daru! Also thanks for your plans to scare me off by instructing everyone to act in front of me like the Ouija board was real or by making me watch a horror movie jisme bhoot end me marta nahi h 😐. Sure I was scared but don't worry, I will still be your 'primary contact' no matter what 😛 ",Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a3a442819323d199d47f1d,Dishaa  Rajora
8,"What do I say about you, Gj! You were the best roommate ever. I could open up to literally everyone I am friends with today because of you. I absolutely love our journey. It’s like we have seen so many ups and downs together, but somehow find our way back to each other :P. Yeah, too cheesy. I still have those cute notes you used to leave me sometimes (with cupcakes and chocolates). I hope you still have the ugly card I made you in the first year. Thanks for taking me to all those treats! And we definitely need a Goa trip together. A better one. Love ya!

11,I will always remember you as the person who locked Jai in a room on my birthday. No thanks for that. But thanks for always helping me with assignments and other things (you know what). Looking forward to the day when you'll smoke a joint with us. Okay bye. ,Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a91d64819323d199d493e0,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar

13,"Thank you for making us dance. Could see the satisfaction on your face when you saw the final 11 sec wala video. I'm gonna post it soon :) Got to spend time with you achhe se in the last couple of months only but everything was so much fun! Props wali party, holi, photoshoots and your gunde wali stories. Kabhi zarurat hui to tujhe hi phone karungi XD ",Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a89725819323d199d49394,Medha  Agarwal
14,"Yes, the mill wala pee yaad h how drunk were we?
Still fascinated by your dance moves and your hilarious stories jo terrace pe suni. Next time achhe se execute karna Ouija board wala plan.😛 Also, pta nahi konse flowers dale the madam apne mere baal me but I kinda like that photo. 
Free tip: Don't scare your future neighbours by shouting like anything. Chup chap chipkali bhagaya karo.

15,"It was you who put me in a video as a sick girl (which I actually was at that time) and you said are tujhe acting nahi karni h tu to already beemar h, bas khaste rehna. I hope that video doesn't exist anymore. Cheers to our not so good Nainital trip and finally thanks for the bag 😛",Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a44387819323d199d48117,Palak  Agrawal
16," “Ji madam khade ho jayein”, Sudarshan sir ka pehla target was always you, me and Priyal would laugh our asses off! It is so much fun irritating you with my lame jokes and you giving me “chappal marungi” wala look. Thank you train me anime dikhane ke liye wo probably first or last anime tha. I hope someday you'll listen to 'tell me if you wanna go home' and won't laugh at ""oh sugar"". Galaxy ka pair performance was the most fun I've ever had on stage. Kitne sync me haga tha. We never got to perform Atrangi Yaari! Looking forward to it <3. Jaldi surprise visit de ab Raipur ake. Miss you 🥺

17,"Pratigya!! Remind me again humne kitne lab courses me fraud mara h? Almost sare? Second year se har course me same group me rahe. Be it Soc473, AE211 or AE462 we always aced our presentations 😂. Or I'd just like to believe so. Will miss all the gossip we did in between classes and ohh how can I forget 351 jisme bechari pragya hamesha time se aa jati thi and we were always late or aake sirf bakchodi karte the. Thank you for bringing out the photographer in me by constantly reminding me that I was photo club secy. <3 Stay fun and cool! ",Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a536fc819323d199d48407,Pratigya  Tomar
18,I cannot believe that time when we both got very serious about basketball and used to go to the court daily for atleast a couple of months. We thought we'd make it to the inter IIT team. 😂😂 All those dynamics quizzes and making cheat sheet jisme we would copy the whole assignment were so much fun!! ,Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a4de14819323d199d48240,Priyakhee  Kachari

20,"Waise to second year se janti thi tujhe, some guy in my branch and Sumukh ka wingie, but jab achhe se first time mile to I was drunk and ofc embarassed myself. I think wahin se friendship start hui. I have so much to say about you, can't summarise ek memoir me. Classes ke beech me gossip, you taking my phone and texting random people, wo adhi movie, bitching about a particular set of people (we still do it), idhar udhar khana and na jane kitni cheezon pe ek dusre ko tease karna. It has been an utter pleasure knowing you! Thanks for making my iitk journey so much fun. Hope to always stay in touch. Lastly, I am very happy to have witnessed drunk Pulkit Pandey!

21,"Can I just take a moment and tell you how grateful I am to God for sending you to iitk? 

I cannot recall kitne years se janti hu tujhe but achhe se college ane ke baad jana. The very first time we interacted in college (after two fucking years of no communication) was during orientation when I gave a stupid answer to some question a senior asked and you made fun of me. I'm glad you did.  

You were always a good listener, you supported me in my lowest days (just like 10th class ki confession wali fight me, thanks for standing up to those korba gang fuckers, yes I still hate them plus no one from our school can see this to I can say whatever I want XD) Coming back to you 😅 you cheered me up in ways I could not imagine, horror movies were no more horror with you. I will take credit for getting you drunk and ofc for that pic with the girl in fairy dress. Abhi to trips pe jana h or job life me teri help bhi karna h. Jaldi ati hu korba milne. Till then, take care and vaccine lagwa lena! <3

22,"Swadhaaaa! I will never forget that moment when I came to your room, and your mom said, “Ye Avani hogi.” You hadn’t even shown her my picture, but she knew right away because you described me as Avani hamesha smile karte rehti h. It was cute. I regret not being active in the club when you were Coordi, but glad ki we got to laugh about the club memories last month me. Aashayein harmonies, crushing on XYZ(you know who), treasure hunt, UC wali treat Dosa ke sath (both of us were trying so hard to cut the social awkwardness) and ofc Swinggg. You are the loveliest and best nap partner ever! Please bring cake to our trip (if it happens). 
PS: Thanks for taking a special interest in my love life. :P ",Avani  Shrivastava,True,60a39eea819323d199d47f08,Swadha  Pandey
23,"Hello sister. Yeah.. No. Hi bro. We had a dysfunctional family 😂 I remember it was the third day in campus, you and me talked all night in the balcony. I knew right away you're the coolest.
