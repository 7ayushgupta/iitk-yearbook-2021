First year mein kaafi tharki samajhti thi tujhe, abhi bhi koi khaas accha nai samajhti hoon😂 par I love you a lot.  Yaad hai nashe mein kuch bhi bolte rehte the apan and kitne faaltu promises. Mere paas teri video hai promise ki ki tu milne aaega pakke se.  Jaob kahin bhi lagi, saal ki ek trip pakki. Ye faaltu vaala promise nai hai, I really mean it.  Mai kitni baar hall2 vaale room aati thi par tu kaafi comfortable tha usse (swapnil to gaand fati mein hi rehta tha poore time😅). Bohot maze kiye apan ne us room mein, kitni acchi memories. Tere kuuch embarrassing videos bhi hai mere paas(hints are: lip gloss and yellow). Nai milne aaya to leak kar dungi.  Bohot sad thi mai jab tu jaa raha tha Kanpur se last month. Honestly maine and Anany ne bhi tab hi jaane ka plan bana liya tha.  RM mein sasti daaru ka alag hi feel hai, kya pata baad mein utna maza ho na ho.

It started with scaring other couples on the skywalk and ended with, NO, it never ended :). You can never imagine how much you meant to me at the time we met. You still have no idea how precious those late-night walks were, how beautiful the sun looked at 5 am with you, how you just understood what I meant, how you just knew what to say at every fucking time, how you always kept my priorities at top, how you never really complained about anything, how you made me laugh even if it wasn’t necessary. I know everything you did required patience and dedication, I know it wasn’t easy for you to get out of your comfort zone but there wasn’t even one single time when you backed out. You are the most rational boyfriend one could expect. Even when we were fighting, you were there for me. Many of the things can not be written here but I know you'll always feel them while reading this. I do and always will appreciate those little things, our walks on ""footpaths"" both inside and outside campus, our first date in bazooka, sneaking through moti jheel barricades, the gatecrash in Kanpur, binging tv series, our spot(wink) and infinite other things. I know I can get too competitive and sometimes it can be difficult but you never uttered a word. I am extremely happy for us to have crossed many challenges that came in our relationship. It was as close to ideal as WE could get. We had our quirks and weirdness. I like having really conversations with you, I love sharing the ""we could go to jail for this"" humor with you. I love that you typed my pet name exactly 69 times in my memoir. I love a million things about you and I can fill pages but can not. You'll know them. I just want to say one thing, there may be a thousand ways in which a relationship MAY or may NOT go, but I know we'll choose what will work best for us. LOVE YOU MOTU 🖤

I will always spell your name wrong. I will always end it with an R and always call you each of those ""not at all offensive"" words :). Kitna bhi rr karle tu, I will always tease you for what you ""have"" and ""do not have."" Because I have full Faith in our friendship (😉).

When we first met, I didn't know what was going on under the hood, and I guess neither did you. You started a streak for my birthdays. Jab mujhe Mudreka ne bola ki poem likh raha hai tu, I thought vo mock kar raha hai meko.  I hope that trend never ends. I always loved your gifts, kaafi efforts bhare hote the unme. I felt a different beautiful connection with you. Gh ke saamne vaali net ke paas jo hum baithe the, vo night hi best lagti hai mujhe aaj tak, that was the first time you kinda opened up. 

Uske baad to walks exponentially hi badh gayi, kaafi campus naap liya humne. I learned a lot un walks pe and I know you did too. Kitna fattu hai tu yaar. Green vaali night mein tune hi concepts batae the and teri hi fat gayi😂.  Kaafi saari baate aisi hai jo likhi nai jaa sakti and shayad likh ke unki importance kam ho jaegi par you still have a special place in my life which will remain reserved for you

Even though our interactions got limited. I am glad to still have that near-perfect connection every time we talk. I know agar apan 10 saal ke baad bhi baat karenge to bhi I can make infi fun of you. Vaise tujhe apni deal yaad hai na? Bhulna mat vo. :)

I will miss seeing you in class everyday (literally everyday). Tere karan jealousy mein mai bhi aane lagi this lol. I still can not believe ki tu kitna kam campus ghooma hai.

48,"The girl I thought won't talk to any living personality turned out to be very cool to hang out with.  You were just one door away or one text away. I have insane countless memories of you.  I remember sometimes you were very easily able to guess my mood and came to check if I was okay, that felt super special. You remember in the first year, I knew you were chaapu so I sat next to you in exams to copy from your sheet but couldn’t understand much, thanks to your ""awesome"" handwriting :), then I asked you directly and you said, ""Umm, I don’t cheat "". I admired you so much because unlike me, you had principles. 

You remember Antaragni and birthdays vaala time third-year mein, Apan chaaro ka best time lagta hai mujhe vo, also do you remember Diwali mela, trampoline kharidne ka mann ho gaya tha almost mera tab. I just loved your Birthday gift, kitna sahi tha vo. 

I was very sad while leaving you guys but in the end but I am glad that I got to see Swadha drunk 🖤

Forever lover <3.

49,"I know tu second year se abhi tak mujhse chidta hai, tere pyaare Anany ko jo le liya😂. Pata nai itni kyu fat ti thi teri mere aane par bilkul chup hoke room se bhaag jaata tha. Par mujhe bada maza aata tha. Par theek hai, atleast daaru parties mein nasho ke karan awkward nai hota tha. Phookna kam karde nunnu!!.

51,"Tujhe yaad hai apan third sem ki kisi class mein saath mein baithe the and aise hi baato mein pata chala mujhe ki double dassa case hai tu. Aage baithna chhod diya tha maine us class mein uske baad ki aise hi randomly chaapu log mil jaate hai. Campus se station vaali ride apni kaafi sad thi end mein. 
Aise hi chaapte rehna:) ",Gunjan  Jalori,True,60a67ee9819323d199d49082,Vaibhav  Jindal
