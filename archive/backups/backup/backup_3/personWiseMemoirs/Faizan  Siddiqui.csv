2,"“Chaar saal me kabhi mai Dishaa se baat nahi karunga” XD. Yeah, well, life is ironic, isn’t it? Sometimes the most unexpected things in life are the best, and I found my best with you. I’ll thank rum and the lack of specs for introducing this amazing friend to me, a friend who has been the craziest celebrator of my success and the most comforting shoulder to cry on. I can never forget kaise tune mujhe ESC201 ke exam ke ek din pehle 14 ghante forcefully padaya tha. Thanks to you, I passed the course and somehow tere se zyada marks aa gaye. Hehe XD. I could only wish to have met you sooner, logo ko judge karna thoda jaldi seekh jata, an essential skill I lacked before :p (still learning tho). Please learn to walk straight and always do cute and clumsy harkate. From late-night walks on campus to driving around on scooty in Bangalore and Goa, this ride has been amazing by your side, and I wish to get the opportunity to hold your hands in the future as well. Take care, Biryani Monster. Stay smart, strong, and silly always. See you, Love you, Faizan",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60a7d3df819323d199d492cd,Dishaa  Rajora
3,"To the future millionaire YouTuber who will buy penthouses for all his friends XD. I still remember the first-year Galaxy when the HEC introduced me to the hall ki jaan, and everyone was like, ""tum Ramola ko kaise nahi jaante"". You are an amazing person with a heart of gold, and not a lot of people manage to have such a charismatic personality with a humble nature like yours. Stay the way you are always, and keep making amazing videos. Your fan, Faizan <3",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,608ef1a1819323d199d47719,Rishabh  Ramola
