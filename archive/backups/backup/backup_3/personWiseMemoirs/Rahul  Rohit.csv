0,"Aman bhai, I consider myself extremely lucky I had you as my first roommate. I can genuinely say ki you are the most pure, humble, innocent and down to earth person I met on campus. Campus ki first morning m apan 2 nikle the chote se walk pe, shaayad teko yaad nahi hoga but aise hi kaafi cheezein h jo first time tere saath hi kari h campus mein. Badminton, squash aur finance mein tu gawd ban gaya, but pubg mein noob reh gaya lol. Witnessed your sheer dedication towards E-cell and common mba and eco courses mein kaafi help kari tune...aise hi life mein chaapte raho, wish you the very best. Stay cheerful always!
Aur haan, light band karke main phone pe padhta nahi tha xD. Milte rahenge aage, tab tak pubg aa hi raha h, usme milo beta pelta hu",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5b600819323d199d4876c,Aman  Jangid
1,"Ananta bhai, you are probably the most sincere-towards-acads person I met on campus. You have an exemplary work ethic and a strive to learn, jisne na jaane kitno ke MTH courses bachaye h first year mein. Apne C6 mein probably tere ""earnest request"" ke wajah se hi ""academic environment"" maintained tha lol. 
A true diehard cricket fanatic and probably the most devoted KKR fan there is, I will never forget our cricket discussions on the mess table. First year mein double dasse ke baad we got to meet the true you, a party animal with a larger-than-life personality. Please never ever change that... all the very best for ahead, you are bound to go places.
P.S. first sem ke aeromodelling workshop mein selfie contest ke naam pe jo fraud maara tha tumne, kbahi nahi bhulunga lmao. Cheers buddy.",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5b26d819323d199d48767,Ananta  Mukherjee
2,"Jab tune first year ke aeromodelling workshop mein fraud maara tha, to garner likes on a stupid selfie contest, mujhe ummeed nahi thi ki tu 1 din GS pahuch jayega xD. Probably the most active and social person in our wing, you were almost always the initiator of our wing plans. Most trips couldn't manage to see the light of the day, but our Lucknow and Goa trips are etched in memories forever. Started with loco, pubg, moved on to mafia, poker, skribbl, and finally 28 and judgement, your involvement in these games was a given. I am very proud you started watching The Office and football games (because of me xD). And tera legendary ""TOH?!"" toh yaad hi h sabko lol.
Aage bhi chaapte reh, hasste reh and sabko Gujarati farsaan khilaate reh. Also, aage ki trips bhi tu hi plan kar ra. Cheers mate, stay in touch!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5bb68819323d199d4876f,Anuj Mayurkumar Shah
3,"Clean coder Umang Malik, others might know as the chaapu CSE guy, but for me you were the one who failed to install Linux on my laptop like 7 times xD. Jokes aside, a genuine, helpful, no-nonsense guy with a slight scope of improvement in the bulla department, not all days need to be super productive lol. Thanks for your answers during Loco times. Saath mein kaafi FPS games mein suffer kara hai, pubg lite, RoE, Apex and probably more. But finally valorant mein chaap rahe hain, though I miss your duelist MVP days. Also you had the most epic (and unique/unfortunate iykwim) GPL in first year lmao. Aage bhi chaapte raho, all the best and stay in touch bhai!",Rahul  Rohit,False,60a63ef4819323d199d48cb1,Umang  Malik
