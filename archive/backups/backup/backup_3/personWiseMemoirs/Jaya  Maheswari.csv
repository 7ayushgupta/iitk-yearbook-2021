Thanks for staying late in the labs for clearing my doubts and also being available on whatsapp.
youu are a very honest person!",Jaya  Maheswari,True,60a3bbe3819323d199d47f54,Anirban  Ghosh
2,"Hey,
First time I met you in Summer'18 where you were high on setting up new records 
You- ""Aaj m 14 hrs soya hu!"" 
Me-  ""Late kyu?"" 
Ayush- ""Tum dono ko jhargadne k waje s group s nikala ja rha h.""
I still don't know the accuracy of the project, but your accuracy of cracking good jokes increased manifold times. Asking your phone number is the cringest thing I have ever done with a guy. Also, after getting the number + 2 minutes of silence I said, ""ab mera bhi rakh lo"" :P
You were the only person who didn't ask ""Kyu"" when I said I am thinking of not making the memoirs public. That's how we connect so well.
I learned to be positive and patient from you but yeh bhulne ki bimari mujhe bhi lag gyi (Should I be grateful to you? no)
In the most annoyed version of you, I admire that the max thing you do is check messages late :')[Tears of happiness].

Me- Achaaaaa
Due to this, we did all the projects, assignments, labs together but not the exam though. You solved my problems ranging from ""helping me not to get deregistered from courses"" to ""finding my bicycle in the academic area"". Thanks for giving all the notes, not because I was insincere because you knew I couldn't read my handwriting. Apart from academic courses, you also took a Sociology course fully delivered by me and the lecture was scheduled in the UOP lab and tutorial everywhere every time.
I will miss chanting ""Bhurapa aa gya"" from your back.
The bicycle rides from NCL to the academic gate will always be remembered :). Kindly use ""might"" word more frequently in sentences.
I made thousands of memes on you will share one of them-
