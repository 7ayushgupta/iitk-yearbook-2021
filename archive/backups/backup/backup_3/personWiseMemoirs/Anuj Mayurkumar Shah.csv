MSE main gine chune hi acche dost bane and you are one of them kyunki humari vibe humesha match hui. Kuch bhi nya karna ke lie tu humesha ready tha. DC courses padhte nahi the par pata nahi kaise A lag jaata tha :P. Class main fb games aur life ke baare main discuss karne hi to jaate the :XD.
2nd year end ke PSO,ESC201  ke endsem ki party abhi bhi baaki hain :P
Aur ha bhai ab delhi exclusively tujse hi milne aana hoga :) aur photo bhi le lenge yaar. Last time mile tabhi bhul gaye. Btw tu kya campus se nikala dosa ne sabko hi nikal dia :XD
P.S. Typical Noisy neighbour jo europa jite wahi baadi baat ho jaegi :P

1,"Cheers to our late night bulla sessions and wing cricket matches. First and second year jitni bakchodi shayad hi kabhi life main ho paegi. You have also been my library partner ( Wo alag baat hain ki ginke 4 baar gaye hain poore 4 saal main :P )
Be the same hardworking cheerful person you have been. Delhi jaise ek aur trip karni hain !!",Anuj Mayurkumar Shah,True,607f71e7819323d199d46cd9,Aman  Jangid

3,"To the batchmate who turned into best friend <3
To the person who I barely spoke to even though we were sitting right next right to each other for an entire semester , who went on to  become someone with whom I started sharing each and everything that happened in my life. ( How did I from this to this waali reel bna sakte ispe :XD)
To someone whom saying goodbye while leaving the campus made me emotional <3.
I guess we have a lot of common interests be it love for Office or you know who ;P
Those late night zoom calls discussing random things or playing games was so much fun.Maybe this friendship was something good that came out of Covid time. 
""I had always considered myself to be a good person but after this incident, I’m not sure about that anymore"" - Ananya . Let people guess how bad this incident can be :P
Thanks for making me understand the difference between tipsy and bhand and for showing me the parts of campus which I would have never visited otherwise. 
3rd April was indeed fun and memorable ( afterall a theory was being proved :P).
“Forever” wala dance is still on the cards bas Jim aur Pam ko ishara karna hain <3
I hope we continue this in the next walk of life where friendship never ends.
We will meet very soon par gaadi chala ke tu mat aana :P

4,"It was because of you I became part of Techkriti core team and now it has became an important part of my college life. Thanks you bhai for convincing me ki Head Web ban jaa and not Manager :P. 
We should thank Covid or lockdown for making our friendship stronger. Will miss those late night pubg sessions if there is lockdown 2.0.

6,"Yo Ashu bhai!!
IITK ka first half wouldn’t be complete without mentioning you. And I can write this on behalf of the entire C6 wing. First year main tere room pe kitne maze kie yaar aur tab tu mna bhi nahi karta tha. Chahe bulla kaatna ho ya forward assault, loco ho ya zupee,game aur purpose badalte gaye par location wahi ki wahi. First year summer main poori raat pubg khelna aur wahi so jaana kyunki cooler bas tere paas tha :p. First year main courses saath main padhna aur library NCL jaana just iss lie ki log jaa rahe the :P. Remember the pattern that we observed : Agar exam se ek raat pehle maine tuje padhaya ya tu mere room main aaya to mere marks kam aate the :XD. 
I hope ki maine tuje jo bhi secrets btae hain wo kabhi bahar na aae :P
 Aakhiri aakhiri main tu “ daredevil cupid stunts” karne main busy tha iss lie itni baat nahi ho paayi. Par hope so ki Goa jaise aur trip ho ( iss baar tuje couch pe nahi sona padega).

7,"Yo Avani!! 
Most of our talks should have been about Techkriti but surprisingly it’s on bitching about someone or planning parties or trips that never happened. And the one which did happen was unplanned. Well We even enjoyed that party until you left :P.
Singing ka to pata tha par never knew ki you even dance well 
Btw mile to ART105 ke through the par uss time ke Anuj ko to main hi yaad nahi karna chahta :P
Jald hi agli trip plan karte hain hoping ki iss baar plan execute ho jae :XD

Baaju waali wing ka hone ke bawajood apni meaningful interaction Techkriti ke though start hua. Massive respect for the hard work and the dedication you put in any work that you take !!
Shivji ke dhwar tak le jaane ke lie shukriya :P Fest hota to alag hi maze aate par still I feel ki Techkriti team ke saath judna was one of the best decision I took in my College life.
Jald hi sab log fir milte hain aur iss baar apan photo bhi le lenge :P",Anuj Mayurkumar Shah,True,60a51a99819323d199d48368,Devendra Kumar Meel
9,"College me ate hi apan ko ""bhai"" bana diya but apan ne usko literally le liya <3
MSE201 ke past year papers share karne se lekaar Chandler banne tak ki journey pata hi nahi chala kaise nikal gayi.
Chaar dewaar ke bahaar ki duniya dikhane ke lie dhanyawaad <3. I will be forever indebted to you for this.( Bahut bhaari word use ho gaya par chill hain :P)
Lucky to hear some random theories devised by you and witnessing one become true <3. 
Dance video banana abhi bhi bach rha hain, jald hi milte hain. Vaise bhi Gujarat to ab aana jaana lga rahega ;P

10,"Yo Raghav bhai!! 
Tere lie memoir likhna is going to be tough kyunki itni memories hai apni ki yahan saari likh hi nahi sakte.
You were the first person I met on campus and bro uske baad C608 main kya kuch nahi kia apan ne. I am a single child so kabhi bhai ka experience nahi tha par tune bilkul bhai ki tarah treat kia. Ladte bhi the par agar koi bahar ka kuch keh de to unse ladne bhi pehle tu hi jaata tha <3. 
Second year main F213 main kitne maze kie the bhai. Wo Shraddha kapoor waala yaad hain ;P. Aur tere wo lessons jo tune hum sabko die the , “How to get a date 101” naamse podcast nikal de kya :XD. TT main kitna pro ho gaya tha bhai tu. I really appreciate ki kaise tu jo cheez uthata hain usme pro ho jaata hain ranging from building muscles to playing guitar to some random course to cryptocurrency.
Goa trip was so memorable just because of you ( not literally but thanks for taking that bold move). Aage aur bhi aise trips karenge.
Tu dil ka bahut accha aadmi hain yaar aur bahut emotional bhi. Zindagi main kuch bhi share karna ho to  you know who to call.

Tu kitna bhaav khata hain yaar :P. Almost saari trips pe tu aaya hai be it Blue world, lucknow, kanpur city trip or Goa ( Saari trip main sabse last “Haa” teri aati thi :XD). 
Humne kitne games saath main seekhi hai yaar and usme pro hue hain fir :P ( Loco, TT, Pubg, 28, Poker , Mafia ,Sweep ( ;P), pattamaar :XD ). Forever grateful for introducing me to Office and Football. Agli trip Camp Nou ki kare ?
Yeh cheerful company bangalore main bhi continue rakhna yaar. Touch main to rahengi hi!!

12,"Yo Raju!!
The only person jiske saath I had a fight ( jisme bc muje to maarne ka mauka hi nahi dia :XD). But bhai uske baad bhi apni friendship bani rahi and that is something commendable. First year ki antaragni ko kya memorable bna dia tha tune. 2-3 logo se to form bhara hi lie the :P.
Humesha haste rehna waala chehre ke karan campus main to dikkat aai tuje (;p) par isko change mat hone dio. Bangalore saath hi jaa rahe to touch main to rahenge hi. Crorepati to tu tha hi aur ab aur aane waala hain dahej main to humara bhi khyal rakhna :XD

Be it pitching a startup idea in second year or actually working on a startup in 4th  you have been a constant throughout the IITK journey. To many more magical moments 🍻🍻
IITK Domino’s waalo se to blacklist ho gya hain so ab Mumbai jaake aise harkataein mat karna :P
Goa trip was the best par pact yaad hain na tuje :XD, wo execute karna hain ab kyunki uske jo main requirement thi wo fulfill ho chuki hain. Proper waala bhaand tabhi honge. 
Maybe I am not telling it so often, but I value our friendship. Thanks for always being there.
