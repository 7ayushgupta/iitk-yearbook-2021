and har ladki ki kundli xD. Sirf baal dekhke tu lakdi ki kundli bta skta h!! Sadly tere sath koi trip nhi ho payi :( but dw at least ek trip toh jarur krenge. Hope ki tu last 30 days campus me aata but okay.
P.S.: Jaldi se IES ban ja fir toh life set.. and bandiya hi bandiya hongi...",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a5667f819323d199d48618,Abhinav  Ankit
1,"Yo Moond! You were the only one in the wing jisko mai pehle se janta tha but tera impression ""Barmer wale ka dost"" tha. Anyway I have always felt good with you. Tera peer pressure me aake kuch bhi bolna, teri logical baate, those trips (vo rafting me doobna).. sab kuch yaad rahega :'). Hum log toh hopefully milte rahenge and abhi kaafi saari trips bhi to krni h ;).
Vaise ye last 30 days kaafi memorable rahe. Ok aise hi hamesha smile krte rehna.

P.S.: Ye crypto me paise sirf doobenge hi :(",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a56340819323d199d485fb,Aditya
2,"Yo R*ndi! I remember that ""soft vs hard"" debate jo orientation k time hua tha and you summarised ""The Alchemist"" xD. You have mostly been busy in Antaragni and stuff, so utna jada maze nhi kr paye jitna maine baaki wingies k sath kia but jitna bhi time spend kia, it was always fun (not saying ki humne kam time spend kia.. kaafi time spend kia xD). Tere sath masti krne me maza ata tha (and calling you 'chuuutiyaaaa') :P
and yes hum log pakka trip pe chalenge ye covid situation thoda improve hone pe. Aise hi humesha haste rehna.
P.S.: I hope tujhe Pulkit wala deo mil jaye :P
P.P.S: Idk how to write in bold but whoever is reading this memoir.. MAI EK BAAR JAI KO GHAR CHHODNE GYA THA (CAMPUS TO HIS CITY) xD.",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a56b54819323d199d4863f,Jai Ranjan Sharma
3,"Yo Kaityar! I am glad to be your wingie. Those night cricket, mafia nights, wing hangouts.. sab kuch yaad rahega :). And yeah you are a chaapu actor.. I hope you will continue this even after college ;). Aise hi hamesha smile krte rehna...",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a62108819323d199d48ae2,Rishabh  Katiyar

6,"Yo Harsh! You were my very first 'CSE' friend. Kuch coursework wagarh discuss krna ho toh you have always been the first contact. Hard-working toh tu h hi.. tujhe dekhke mujhe kabhi kabhi motivation milta tha magne ka. And you are really a good guy! Agar tu na hota wing me toh I can't imagine mera kya hota department me. Hope ki hum log aur trips kare sath me and yeah Korea aayenge hum log milne ;).
P.S.: If anyone is going through this memoir, then do follow ""Manufacturer Harsh Agarwal"" on fb :P",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a56511819323d199d48607,Harsh  Agarwal
7,"Yo Pence! One of the nicest guys I have met in college. Coaching me I had seen you when MSC sir introduced you as ""shooter"", tab I found your name weird xD. You have always been a humble and helpful guy. kisi ko kuch bhi help chahiye ho, you have always been ready. and man you are really hard-working.. I am sure agar itna dedication continue rakhe toh you'd definitely achieve great heights. And I still remember that chappal wala incident xD.
Aise hi haste rehna.. Hope ki hum log milte rahenge and yeah jald hi trip krte h ;)",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a5743c819323d199d48682,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar
8,"What do you call a nude rat in a shoe? Yes tere jokes isse bhi jada lame hote hai. Anyway I have been lucky to meet you. You are really very creative and those memes on VBK have really made me laugh xD. ""Aisa kyu"", ""Ni khana maine"" all those quotes I'd remember always.. and pubg khelne me jo maja ata tha my fellow AOB mate, those mafia nights :), gym ka subscription leke na jana, those tatti jokes .. and the Sikkim trip .. that river rafting adventure.. xD. Can't write everything here. Contact me to hum rahenge hi and hopefully trip bhi krenge soon. and aise hi hard working rehna and bakchod robots banana iykwim.
P.S.: apni intern k baare me kisiko mat batana 🤫 
P.P.S.: You still have one year to install an AC in RR-CC.. ab toh kr hi lena ploxx",Bholeshwar  Khurana,True,60a61a40819323d199d48a75,Ratnangshu  Das
9,"Yo Tarish! Glad that we have been 'bhais'. You are one of the most knowledgeable guys I've ever met. If we start from the very beginning, I remember you got that T-shirt during orientation and then teri GPL li thi xD. That was the time when most of us got acquainted with the concept of GPL xD. Be it anime, tech, food, movies, any random stuff.. you had knowledge about every f thing. Those trips, I could never forget. Man tujhe trekking krwayi thi!! can't even imagine. Those gyaan chodna sessions by you, when you used to die in pubg and then (mis)guide us, random youtube videos... can't write lombe paras unlike you :\
Anyway hope ki hum log jaldi milenge.. Man I believe you can reach great heights, you just have to move your lazy ass..
P.S.: Aunty cooks really well.. and I hope I get another chance(s) to visit your home...",Bholeshwar  Khurana,False,60a56f93819323d199d48661,Tarish Tapan Sen
