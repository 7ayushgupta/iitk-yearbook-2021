0,"Bhai tere liye genuine respect. Jab wing m Raghav ko chot lagi thi tab tune hee usey admit karwaya tha. Sabse selflessly help karne vala nature tha tera, which makes you reliable and trustworthy. Tere saath daaru nahi pee kabhi par sochta hu ki pee hoti toh maza ata :P 
First year k Endsem exams m bhi tera antargni ki bandiyon se flirt karna yaad rahega.
Jab tu college se ja raha tha, tab tere aansu nikal gaye the, kyu saale, marr thodi na rahe h ham? Phir milenge.
(Jab tu IAS ban jaega, tab hame bhoolna mat, bhaiyon k memoir koi likhta h bhala? Par tune mera likha toh formality karni padi.)",Archit  Gupta,True,60a644e7819323d199d48d34,Aayush  Saini
1,"Why so sweet Abha?
I didn't want to write this, as putting a few things in words can risk it being spoilt. But nonetheless, I will take my chances.
Hereby, I acknowledge you have always unconditionally and patiently helped me. Be it making my resume, getting notes from different departments, group project and uhh the list goes on... 
Kabhi apne baare m bhi soch liya kar.

Agar ho sake toh tujhe itna annoy aur irritate karne k liye maaf kar dena🙏",Archit  Gupta,True,608092cf819323d199d46d44,Abha  Tamrakar
2,"Sainik School. Bhai tere stamina ka lifetime fan rahoonga. Tere saath baith kar baatein karne m maza ata tha. Tere Sainik school k kisse aur professors ko galiyan. TA202 teri vajeh se bearable tha. Tere Sainik School ki glory IIT se zyada h, yaad rakhna. Aur kabhi peeche mud kar mat dekhna, apne aap ko underestimate bhi mat karna kabhi. I would like to see you ultra- successful and happy in future...",Archit  Gupta,False,60a64cfb819323d199d48dd5,Anshuman  Pal
3,"Archit bhai, tere charmander se charlizard ki journey epic thi, tere room m aakar chill marna was the best. Thanks for bearning my unending questions and my presence in your room for absolutely no reason..",Archit  Gupta,True,60a6532e819323d199d48e49,Archit  Mishra
4,"I think few in the campus know how good your fighting IQ is. How you defeated a fearsome black belt to grab the gold medal at udghosh!
We had our own bouts of art inspirations. Perhaps the person I related the most in terms of hobbies, namely, taekwondo, reading novels and not to forget, you make amazing art 😍😍
Cheers to the intense kickboxing sessions at the PE ground. Those days will be remembered.
Wishing you great success ahead.",Archit  Gupta,True,60809813819323d199d46d48,Ashutosh  Kumar
5,"Dear roomie!! I remember the first day our baapu asked ""Idhar kisi ko gaaliyon se problem hai kya"" and you innocently raised your arm. 
I thought I was sharing my room with a ""dev manus"".... But then, *cough* *cough* IITK happened. While staying in the room, we didn't talk as much. But when we did, they were often deep meaningful and philosophocal conversations.
On a different note. Perhaps, I am the only first year who enjoyed a single room thanks to you. Really sorry for irritating you with my midnight meditation yoga sessions.
And I know you still give me  dirty looks for that day when Raghav came to my in first year and said ""some things"". I was not a part of it. I was just, listening, :P unwillingly. ",Archit  Gupta,True,60808e61819323d199d46d42,Ayush  Mishra
6,"Bhai tune Taekwondo m first year m freshers m jo enthu dikhaya tha, lagta h jaise kal ki hee baat ho. Acads m mere doubts clear karne k liye dhanyavad... aur haa, yar, taekwondo plans toh paani m hee reh gaye, maybe some things are never supposed to happen. This being one of them. Let's see if our paths cross, agli baar belt zarur lenge!!",Archit  Gupta,True,60a64eec819323d199d48df9,Debmalya  Sarkar
7,"First day of college: frustratingly looking for directions of the T.A lab. 
A week later, runs an election campaign, writes a memo stating direction boards should be kept all all over the academic area. (And I was like, arey yeh toh wahi h jo T.A lab dhund rahi thi)

8,Mess m breakfast k dauran company dene k liye dhanyavad. Sorry bhai tere force karne par bhi tere complicated games nahi khel paya m. Agle janam m shayad? :P,Archit  Gupta,True,60a653b7819323d199d48e50,Prajjwal  Mishra
9,"Tere room m Bhagwan Ji ki photos lagi thi, aur agarbatti bhi. Ek dum saaf suthra room, ek dum satwik insaan h bhai tu. Acads ko lekar kitna rr krta tha bhai tu :P See? We are fine now. Degree mil jaegi, tension mat le :D Sociology ki class yaad rahegi...apna group work sahi tha, wo prof hee nalayak nikla XD",Archit  Gupta,True,60a64ddf819323d199d48de8,Prashant  Chouhan
10,"You had the audacity to make paper balloons (and audibly blow it) during an intense T.A group discussion.
I am sure you can pull this off at meetings in workplace and still not get fired.
Stay childish.
Wishing you a great life ahead :)

11,"I am not sure but everybody know it but is never going to say it. This guy has a immense knowledge of great range of obscure topics. Plus, he remembers statistics and figures for things like the contribution of pisciculture to the indian GDP.
And he can pull them out and surprise you when you are least prepared. 
One example being, when you asked me to recall some italian names and I couldn't. And then you instantly named so many I was so Impressed. 
The whole wing revolves around this guy, we always knew you were destined for great things. 
I know you know that. :D",Archit  Gupta,True,60809095819323d199d46d43,Raghav  Maheshwari
12,"M jab galaxy m poora padhai se fraud maarta tha, tab tune mera MTH aur ESC bachaya, I know our friendship is deeper than we acknowledge, sociology discussion were lit! Tera awkward sense of human keeps you from becoming a super human.
Football was awesome, I wish m ek second expansion karke tum logo k saath aur khel pata. Lockdown k dauran tumhara chef roop accha laga!
You are legend for the generations to come at IITK, HR kadim diwan k levels pe toh chaap diya tumne, bas tumhari soniya kelkar missing h :P",Archit  Gupta,True,60a650f5819323d199d48e23,Rishabh  Batra
