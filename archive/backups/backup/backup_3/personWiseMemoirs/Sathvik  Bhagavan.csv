I have always enjoyed the time we have spent playing cricket or just discussing random stuff, maybe about cricket, courses, or general. I know and have full faith that you will succeed in your future! All the best! Let's hope we have a chance to meet again on campus. Cheers!",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abbc1b659165b3aa644dad,Atul  Kumar
1,"Hey Naman! I cannot describe what our friendship means to me. Over the four years, I have learned so much from you, especially how to be calm and keep your cool even in the most intimidating circumstances. You have always helped me whenever I needed it. All the classes that we attended together in our first year, assignments, exams, discussions, the fun we had in our rooms, Antagragni, trips, and other events are reminiscent memories. Also, your shenanigans made me laugh every time and forget about any tough day I had, and of course, the long hours of cricket playing will always be a pleasant memory for me. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors, and I have complete faith in you that you will succeed and fulfill your dreams. 

PS: I hope the book Undercover Economist is a gift for me from you :)",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60aa63c2819323d199d49450,Naman Agrawal (M Agrawal)
2,"Hey Nitish! I still remember you coming into my room, confirming and filling out all the forms for our internship at TAMU, excited for a good opportunity in summer. I also remember the conversation in the cab going home for Holi about Covid and its possible hindrance in our internship, and unfortunately, it did come true. I am sure we would have gotten to know each other very well if there would have been no covid. Anyhow, I really enjoyed all the limited conversations I had with you, especially in the airport, if you remember. All the best wishes for your future studies and possibly try to remain in touch. Cheers!",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abc1d1659165b3aa644daf,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
3,"Hey Sabhay! I don't have any words to describe how special our friendship is to me. The fun we had together everywhere on the campus, in classes, playing, trips to serious discussions on various topics, I have enjoyed each moment. I remember we played a lot of mobile cricket games, especially in our database class 😁.  I am forever indebted to you for the help you gave me in all the courses 🙏. I am very happy for all the success you have had till now and completely sure you would soar to great heights! All the best and hopefully don't forget me 😛 and keep in touch.",Sathvik  Bhagavan,False,60afc6df659165b3aa644e6e,Sabhay  Jain
4,"Hey bro! Time has flown by, and our friendship has strengthened. Even though NLP may be a course with no good experience, as a result of that, we did get closer through the course. I still remember the conversation we had about God and Mysticism, and both of us had opposite views 😛 . All the cricket that we played together is all but a happy memory for me. All the best for your future! I hope we can meet again on the campus soon.",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abbe69659165b3aa644dae,Saurab  Jain
5,"Hey bro! From the project in TA201A, where we met for the first time, we have come a long way. I can safely say you are one of the closest friends of all time. From all the struggles in Mechanical Department, all the restless nights going through assignments, sitting in lectures together, discussing life, career, you have been a constant mate in all this chaos. Whenever I felt bad about anything, you cheer me up, and every time we talk, it usually ends more than an hour! I am pleased about all the successes you have achieved in your life and have full faith that you will flourish in any path you undertake. All the best for your future! I know we would always be in touch! 😛 ",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60abba18659165b3aa644dac,Shashi  Ranjan
