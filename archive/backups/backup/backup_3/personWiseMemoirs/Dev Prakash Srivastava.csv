0,"I remember my first all-nighter in IITK. First year, sitting in your room (E-101), playing CONTACT😂 and then getting into some deep philosophical shit till morning(as would become typical). From then to my last all-nighter, sitting on the path in front of A-Block, wondering how our time at IITK will be coming to an end and how we’ll make the most of it, it has been hell of a ride. Through all the years at IITK, I’m glad we shared all those talks, some sober and some drunk af. 
Also that birthday surprise you all gave, hard shit to forget😁. It was one of my best moments at IITK.
Finally, I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again you are the person whom I’ve seen evolve the most in IITK and I greatly admire and respect you for it.
