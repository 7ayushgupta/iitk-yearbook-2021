0,"Hello Madam !!
From being my first friend in college to getting placed in the same company (and even in the same location) <3 
It has been 4 long years ... Never thought I would spend so much time with you. (even being in different departments)
Have so many memories to share but one of the most memorable is our trip to Banglore (yaad h excitement me tu ticket bhul gayi thi aur fir kitna juggad karke nikalna pada tha)
Thank you for always supporting me emotionally and being there for me every time I needed it.
Stay amazing as always !!!

I remember we first met in takneek for a robotics event and the nightout with you was pretty fun. (also got to know how fun-loving person you are)
After that never got a chance to spend much time but jane se phele your last goodbye made me soo emotional.
All the best for all your future endeavours :)
Be in touch <3 !!!",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60a62a55819323d199d48b69,Maitreyee  Srivastava
3,"Hey Nikita !!
Although we have met and talked several times before, but 4 saal me itna rapport kabhi nahi bana jitna last month me bana.
I really miss those long walks, our plans to explore the campus ( which failed everytime we made ), and those amazing photoshoots.
Will always remember our crazy bulla sessions and the way we used to share our secrets.
Thanks a lot for making my last month so memorable 
All the best for all your future endeavours :)
Be in touch <3 !!",Nalli  Bhavita,True,60a57478819323d199d48685,Nikita  Singh
4,"Hi my princess haddi !! ( 😉 pls don't get offended )
I had never thought we'd ever be friends in my first year, but we ended up being the best. I honestly don't remember how or when I met you, but I am grateful that I did.
My go-to person (even for the silliest things). Thanks a lot for patiently listening to all my boring stories ( knowingly and unknowingly, you are the only one with whom I have shared everything)
I will never forget those killer expressions (sometimes they even scare me  😂 )
All of those movie nights and bulla sessions are memories I will cherish for the rest of my life.
Stay amazing as always !!! May all your wishes come true and may you achieve everything you desire.
Hope to meet you soon! and love you a lot 😘
Didi ke shaadi me bulana mat bhulna .....
