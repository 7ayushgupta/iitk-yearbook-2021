11,"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur Academic Senate and Board has approved launching of new 4-year BS and 5-year BS-MS programs in “Statistics and Data Science” from the coming academic year 2021-22.  The admissions to the programs will be through JEE (Advanced).

Data Science, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning are playing increasingly important roles in finding solutions to diverse real-world problems. Research in data science in the next 20 years is expected to focus on developing mathematically rooted models that can be implemented efficiently. The synergy of theory and applications requires training specific to a unique set of skills, and the BS and BS-MS programs in Statistics and Data Science have been launched in response to this need of effective implementation in real-life situations.

Students undergoing this program will be exposed to various types of structured and unstructured data with applications and will not only be well suited to build flourishing careers in industry and the new entrepreneurial India, but also to pursue higher studies in classical and modern statistics and data science. In collaboration with the proposed School of Medical Research and Technology (SMRT), students would also work on health-related data and digital health to give a much-needed boost to research and analytics in this important emerging area.

This is gonna be a long memoir. I know I have many friends here, many as close as you, but I can't simply ignore the fact that who I used to rush to first in times of distress, and who always used to help me out. A L W A Y S

If I start figuring out how the friendship started, it was probably when I started to came to meet tarish, and then dipuk added me to the spammer grp. But I had absolutely no idea how important you'll be for me in the upcoming 3 years, and beyond

To consistent bitching about everyone, to late night mamamios, to innumerable spamming, to almost many many of the memorable aspects of my life at IITK, you have played a central part. China ki mkb, uski wajah se kitni planned trips reh gyi, but ab jaldi hi hogi I believe so 😤

Thanks to specially you, and many others, 1st year me jis hall 12 ki mkb karte the, almost became my second home, and I had enormous fun and gossip time there, especially D3, I can never forget the wing

Also jitni baar canteen me tere naam se khaaya hai bhai🤣, wapas maangne mt lag jaana kangaal ho jaunga, ya wait doge se jo kamai hogi usse de dunga, ameer to hone wale hain hum XD

Aree haan, another important part, Pubg, valorant, oh bhai kitna khele hain humlog, pubg me to tum log pro the ekdam lmao, ajeeb lagta tha but still khelne aa jaata tha, anyway maza bahut aaya usme, sab cheezon me kahi na kahi ek memory rahi hi hai tujhse related jo ki humesha humesha yaad rahegi mujhe

Aur bhi kai cheezein hain ig, but ab aur nahi likhunga. Waise bhi ye wholesome nature apna inbuilt nahi hai, so Bhola Chutiya likhte hue khatam karta hu.

Starting with ""Laut aao 2nd year wali diksha""
We first met before the trip to delhi ig, and that time I had no clue how important role you'll play in my college life. Since then we had so many trips, so many up downs, and of course you have changed by miles, but still I believe we share a great bond :p
Since you know it is impossible to encapsulate all those memories we made, I'll leave this memoir with a few positive words. Since I can boast off the fact that I have known you the best all these years XD, you were really one of those sweet and simple girls everyone would admire. I was well there though to witness the third year transition to your ""Angry Goddess"" role, and the final year wala introvert mode bhi, but over all those years, your empathy and kindness for others didn't change, which I am extremely proud of.
You know I am very bad at expressing emotions, hence I would just like to thank you for the innumerous times you've helped me, and for those innumerous memories throughout the life at IITK.
And no, I won't kill you XD

I have seen a change in you after 2nd year tho, I don't know what it is,I can't explain but you have been more shy and introvert after that as I feel, although our personal relations remain the same 😎. Before that you were lmao noov, now atleast in our group you're pru-most.
Keep spreading positive vibes around the world,noov. Also I admit that I've never met anyone more friendly in acads than you(maybe Sahil, or Bhola :p but they weren't much relevant in my dept XD, hence you retain the title)

I feel it was an honor for me to have found a friend like you out of nowhere. Countless times I have woken up to your wholesome tags, and it made my day. 3 years passed like nothing with your company, having first met in COM lab XD.

Our common love for cattos birbs pokemons doge and many many things made us so compatible with each other. Every time I see you on social media or real life, I understand that some positive vibe is about to emerge. Thanks really for coming in my life and making my campus stay so much better
Abhi ek saal aur hai GG, hoping to see you soon. Also I know you'll prosper to greater heights in future, bhool na jaana baad me, remember who keeps the ""Discrete mathematician"" alive in you

Through continuous leg pullings, to threatening each other of texting other's through our phones, and to spontaneous sarcasms, two years passed.
Fir tune dhokha dia and wing badal li😭, aur poora maggu and decent ban gaya😭. U will not be forgiven for this 😤. But atleast what I love that your tendency to help others and specially me never got lost.
