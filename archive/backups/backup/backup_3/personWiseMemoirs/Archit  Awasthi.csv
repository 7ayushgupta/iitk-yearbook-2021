One of the purest soul of our wing. A guy who always wished good for others. You have always been there whenever I needed any help, be it in Udghosh Hospi or anything. Late-night discussions with you have always been fun. And even in this pandemic you always join the wing VCs irrespective of the time❤
Stay the same bro and keep in touch always.

1,"Yo Ananto !!
I will always remember you as the ""work hard and party hard"" guy. The way you stood up in F2 was legendary. First year me humesha doubts batane ko taiyar rehte the bro. And tumhari branch change ke baad Batti courses me kami lagi tumhari. 
I can never forget your birthday celebration at OAT and then dancing in the wing until seniors came to shut our party down. You have always been an interesting guy to talk to. 
Also thanks for the ""Paris Darshan"". Video call pe Eifel tower dikhaya :p Aaj bhi video call ka SS saved hai.
You have been the kind of guy who was always enthusiastic to hang out with the wing, and have always been the front runner in all the fun episodes. Be it EDMs or Holi Party you have always been there with the wing. 
Never knew that car ride to home/station with you would be the last time we'd be meeting as college students.
Stay the same bro. Hope to meet you real soon!",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a570ec819323d199d48669,Ananta  Mukherjee

From Fortnite to Valo you have come a long way. You have always been the quiet and knowledgeable guy. Tera flipkart plus kaafi use kiya hai sabne :p

The oldest (or second oldest) member of C6. Wing me sabse mature aur chill banda hai bhai tu. C6 me koi bulla bole toh Ashu ka room yaad aata hai. Tere room pe kitne maze kiye hain bhai. Tere ko pehli daaru pilayi hai bhai meine :p
Teri GPL lene me humesha maze aaye hain. Tere sath political debates me kya hi maze aate the. Let's hope jald hi fir milen aur saath me daaru party karen. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a5764d819323d199d4868a,Ashutosh  Sharma

You have wonderful art skills. I still remember during first-year you used to record charcoal drawing and other paintings. Keep in touch bro!   ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a5566e819323d199d4857a,Ayush  Bhorse
5,"O ma Bebo :-*
Sabse mast aadmi of my college life. Jiske saath masti bhi bahut ki aur seekha bhi bahut kuch. 
First Impression: Big Guy from Odisha, probably killed a few people before, who goes to canteen A LOT.
Can't forget tera Philosphy padhana mujhe xD. Second year me tujhe roommate banae ke liye almost lad hi liya tha mein. And I am glad. Tere saath din-raat gossips, ghar ki stories, aur mazaks sabme bahut maze aate the. You are probably one of the very very few people who have seen me cry in college. You have been someone jisse sab khulke share kiya hai meine. Tere se life ke baare me bahut seekha mein. Tujhe shayad na pata ho but tere random gyans have helped me a lot to grow up. 
Tere saath PUBG khelna (Ping968 <3) was/is so much fun. Esp bcoz you are a pro gamer. Be it cards or any shooting game.
Can't forget that day jab teri lab miss ho gayi thi. 😂
You will definitely go places, bro. You are one of the most hardworking and dedicated (not to mention brilliant) guy I know. 
For me, you would always be the big burly guy who is very mature of his age and pure by heart.

Tu ek aisa banda hai jo wing ke bahar bhi full involve hua aur wing me bhi sabke saath rha. Jald hi ab tu naam roshan karega wing ka UPSC me. Tere baare me sabse acchi baat: Dosto ke liye humesha taiyyar rehta tha tu. Aage bhi aise hi rahio. Aur bhul mat jaio kabhi humko. ✌",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a41850819323d199d48083,Girish  Sharma

You are one of the most sincere and hardworking guy I have ever met. Thanks for being there in CHM201. Stay the same bro! ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a554d5819323d199d48560,Harshit  Kumar
8,"Asli bhai hai tu. Mini Militia, PUBG se lekar cards tak sabme pro player. Tere se sikha ki kaise magai aur maze me balance banake chalna hota hai. Tu bhale hi age me kam tha but kaafi mature hai. Teri birthday party toh BEST thi. Pata hi nhi laga kab baccha bada ho gya xD. Tera room toh party room hi ho gya tha. 
Udghosh-Techkriti me saath me hospi me nhi hota tu toh ghanta kuch ho paata. Second year me just saamne room tha tera kabhi bhi ghus jao, humesha open. Tere se baat karke humesha accha lagta hai. 
Aise hi call karke touch me rehna bro. Keeping it family-friendly here :p",Archit  Awasthi,False,60a3b99e819323d199d47f4f,Lavesh  Gupta
9,"Yo Nimish!
You may look big and tough from the outside, but I know you are very sensitive and caring for your friends. Your dance tutorial during Odessey was legendary. You are one of the few guys who were never afraid of trying new things and I am pretty sure that will take you places!
Be it wing parties or cricket matches your enthusiasm was what kept the wing going. Let's hope we get to party together soon. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a55b8d819323d199d485b1,Nimish  Agarwal
10,"Yo Roomie! Tu mera sabse pehla roomie tha life me. Pehli baar ghar se bahar nikla and tere se seekha ki kaise chill rehte hain. Kitni bhi tension ho, kaise aram se rehte hain. Soo many memories shared with you... Balloon fulana kamre me.... Mini Militia Nights.... College life me first roommate influences your aage ki journey and I am glad I got you as a roommate. Tu kabhi bhi apne acche kaamo ka credit nhi leta. Let's hope aage aur bhi patte khelenge kabhi. Shaadi me bulana mat bhulna :p",Archit  Awasthi,False,60a3b5f3819323d199d47f44,Rahul  Gupta
11,"Yo Raju aka NotAnEzTargt xD!
One of the most entertaining guy of our wing. First year me B6 me ""ragging"" lena aur Anuj/Bibhu ke sath epic fights were all too much fun. Also you were senior's favourite in our wing :p
Second year me tune party badal li thi 😪 From PUBG to Valo pro player kaafi badla gaya tu.
You were my go-to guy for this pandemic placement session. Resume se lekar tests tak sab tere saath discuss kiya. Stay the same boi. Let's hope job ke time bhi touch me rahenge asie hi.",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a4029a819323d199d48031,Raj  Kumar

13,"Ladies and cheems, introducing you the youngest member of C6, the one who never wears half-shirt, A* in ESC and LIF, Fakka in MTH, Vietnam intern, sole admin of our wing group, most loved senior of some, greatest memer, controversy brewer, unofficial Festi of fests, Institute PUBG League Chairman, moderator of IIM the great Shobhit Sachan. *Drum Rolls*

Bhai mein tera example deta hu jab bhi talented logo ki baat krte hain. Tera transformation meine apne saamne dekha hai. First year me aaya hua banda jo pehle kafi kam baat kr pata tha ab mast convo carry karta hai.  You started programming aur ESC me A* le aaye. Explore krte krte kitne saare projects kr diye that you had to remove some of them from your resume :p. You started playing PUBG, and you literally (Ace)d it there. 
Everything that you tried, you have aced. And I am pretty sure ki aage jaake tu jis bhi chees me jayega you'll find your way to the top. I say that not only because you are talented but because you are fearless. Jaha hum log darr ke alag ho jaate the, you have been the 'Jo hoga dekha jayega' types.

Sorry to have ditched you at the bus stand :p Humesha regret rahega uska xD
You are the guy jo humesha wing calls me join karta hai. Wing ko aise hi connected rakhna bro.
You are the guy jiske saath college ke baad bhi kabhi touch nhi chutega. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a414fe819323d199d48074,Shobhit  Sachan
14,"Yo Sunit!
One of the most enthu wala banda of our wing. Someone who always worked hard to achieve success in life. You have always been the explorer type. I still remember first year me health issues ke karan ghar jaana pada tha but you covered the time lost. I will always remember you as the chill guy who made wing gatherings more fun. Keep in touch bro!",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a56d69819323d199d4864f,Sunit  Gautam
15,"Hi Umang!
I can never thank you enough for being there. You have always been my go-to guy. Koi bhi problem ho ya kuch suggestion chahiye ho mujhe humesha I know I can reliably turn towards you. Your work ethics have always inspired me. Kaafi chill wala banda hai tu, and bahut hi rare instances me kabhi gussa hua hai.
Wing ka Tech God rha hai tu humesha se. Laptop se lekar mouse lene take sab tere se aake pucha hai meine.
I am happy that we got to share so many memories together. Antaragni PR (paise wapas nhi kiye unhone :p) me saath me kaam kiya tha sabse pehle. Kaafi fun times the wo. Also first year me wing ke saath EDM jaana. Oh and your Euphoria wala dance 😍
Odessey Treasure Hunt, Takneek aur SnT code me kya hi maze kiye hain bhai. Saath me questions solve krne ka try karna.... kitne mazedar moments the wo.
DSA ke question se lekar Valorant tak har jagah you have been the one carrying me.
One thing that I am super proud of you about was your SCD profile. Although deleted, original copy mere pass abhi bhi padi hui hai :p
And that one time you commented on a YT channel (thanks for that, I was secretly happy for that :p)
You have been one of those guys who was always up for group video calls. Those late-night video calls and discussion sessions are some of the most cherishable memories. 
You were an integral part of my placement journey bro. From the silliest doubts to the most challenging problems you were always there to guide me. 
Our PUBG and Valorant sessions have been legendary. Ping968 ka Miramar match kabhi nhi bhul sakta hu.

First-year me star gazing to third-year me next-door-roomie, it has been a truly amazing bonding, at least for me. From canteen trips to mess trips, from discussing politics to life experiences, from participating in treasure hunts to pubg rank push, from waking up for breakfast to late-night skribble games, it has been really fun times. 

Cheers to many more memories and amazing friendship! Looking forward to more trips in future with you boi.",Archit  Awasthi,False,60a646ed819323d199d48d63,Umang  Malik
