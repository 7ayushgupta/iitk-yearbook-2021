You were my bad boy(the word villain looked crueler, [then again you told me not to give too much fucks]) for more than half of our roommateship thingy, but now, I cringe at every memory of yelling for nonveg and other gassy stuff, nevermind about that, and yeah you were also exposed to my weird diary, damn also a source of cringe, nevermind. Had cherished every Kathi roll while watching pewdiepie mincraft pee pee poo poo video(damn gonna miss that kathi roll). Wish that I came along when you asked me to come outside my room. Damn writing this feels like an apology letter to my ex. nevermind(why should I give fucks, yeah?🤣). Anyway, let's meet again someday, sometime in the sky or something or dreaming of sky while on bed ha ha",Deepak  Prajapati,True,60a65ac9819323d199d48ec0,Aaiyush  Kapurwan
1,"Hello there,
hope that you are ok, when you read this, today or 50 years from now(some random shit came in my mind never mind). We played some Minecraft and stuff together and yeah, and there are always memes about...
May the force be with you. ",Deepak  Prajapati,False,60a663dd819323d199d48f68,Aviral  Shukla
2,"Hello there!
haa bhai, first year me to  kaphi time sath me bitaya tha. Yeah and I remember that peacock photo on doaa canteen, locking two cycles with one lock, searching for NCL labs for the first time... mast tel me machali fry karke khane wahi wali video ho to bhejana 😁. Baki time to gaming me hi nikal gaya, no regrets for that I guess, but wo time kisi better jagah bhi spent ho sakata tha. call me anytime if you ever want to play some games and don't know where to start 😊. Pata nahi tha ki tum bhi potterhead ho, ab tereko bhi uski memes bhejni padegi 😒. Anyway, let's meet again along this mysterious journey of life someday. ""The world is a cruel place but it's also very beautiful"", damn that came out of nowhere, nevermind. aur haa mereko hindi me likhana chahiya tha 🤣.",Deepak  Prajapati,True,60a65833819323d199d48e91,Ritesh  Kumar

Hello there,
sorry, this meme I found today had to go somewhere and no better place than to make someone smile, instead of writing some long-ass story about stuff that never happened(wish I spent more time with the bros), I am gonna leave here some poetry I found.

Bob opened up his chips in class, releasing cheesy air - His teacher asked, ""Is there enough so everyone can share?""

He didn't have enough within the bag that he had brought - He sighed as he replied, ""I'll look to see just what I've got.""

He stood and reached below and shoved his arm inside his ass - Bewildering his peers who sat disturbed inside class.

His teacher stared in horror and he didn't bat a lash, as Bob was digging deep to search his hidden anal stash.

And with a pop he pulled a bag, his ass gaped like a ditch - He said, ""Now there's enough for all, you commie fucking bitch.""

hope that made you laugh 😂😂,  edible stuff reminded me of chura(stuff made of rice as namkeen) that you used to bring from home. 🤣🤣. Lets meet again someday, somewhere....",Deepak  Prajapati,True,60a662a5819323d199d48f57,Shashank  Kumar
