0,"I remember the first walk I had in IITK, it was with you, figuring out the way to the airstrip. Tabhi se feel aa gayi thi ki bohot genuine banda hai, and this is the kind of people I want to meet here. It's been a long journey since, one that I've had the privilege to share with you. We've shared goals, dreams and ambitions, but the thing I'll remember the most is being able to share the truth with you. You may not think of it as much, but genuinely bohot kam log milte hai jinnke sath you can actually be yourself. I believe in you bhai, you just need to build the same confidence in you about yourself. Math ka RR to hum dono hi bhoolna chahte hai, so I won't recollect that here. What I want to cherish is our shared aspirations, our countless efforts chasing it and our shared dreams which we're going to achieve sooner rather than later.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a3df56819323d199d47fb8,Aakash  Khandelwal
1,"Bhai! Can't even begin, or hope to capture the moments I've shared with you, yearbook mei itni capacity hi nahi hai. College ki pehli daru se leke akhri tak (I made it a point not to drink after you left), canteen ke kebab parantha se leke Goa ke kaju tak, first year ke kattapa se leke...kattapa to tu abhi bhi hai XD, college ke some of the best experiences I've had the privilege of living with you. I'm terribly poor at first impressions, but thank god I was right about you, you bright bundle of positive energy. Even though NN was making us laugh, you've been the one to make me smile. In some of my darkest times in IITK, teri koi faltu bakchodi ya impossible plan was enough to remind me what's good in life, a random visit to your room was enough to remind me ki jitna bhi haggu I'll always have the best place to return to. Honestly, you've been the glue to our group, wo fevicol ka jod jo dosti jodta chala gaya. If I use the IITK lingo of bhai in it's truest sense, you shine as the best example of it. If ever you need me, if ever you make a plan, count me in, cause it's not about the place, it's about the people ( ;) ). This is not goodbye!

2,"Smartest person on campus, hands down (I include the profs too XD)! With that out of the way, thanks for all the memories and support man! I really appreciate it. I can't think of any other person to share the coordiship of Pclub with, and if it wasn't for times when we had to just grind thorugh it, the club would've failed. You've been the best coordinator the club has seen, atleast in my eyes (and that's a big compliment given the history). But you go way beyond that, I've always been in awe whenever I've worked with you, be it competing in Inter IIT, discussing topics people will understand only after 150 years, working through making problems or lectures, designing a Tshirt or even simply playing board games. I've always felt a certain ease when hanging out with you, and maybe that's why it was special for me. I'll cherish our talks cycling to and fro to RM, movie screening and board games in astro club, our discussions (literally everywhere), our 'trip' to Bombay, shared lunches and dinners (pizzas have never tasted the same outside Sandy's room) and most importantly, everything I've learnt from you. See you soon in Cali mate, we've yet to conquer Disneyland!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a4384f819323d199d48102,Aditya  Gulati
3,"Bsdk! Sorry, couldn't start your memoir without this. Let me start this memoir with an apology you deserve, tu humara personal punching bag tha but you stood strong through all of it. Can't think of a more fun or interesting person I've ever met, or imagine college life being what is was without you! And honestly speaking, you're one of the few people I cherish the most meeting here, so definitely US to leke jaa raha hu tujhe bhale hi bag mei bharke leke jana pade...can't imagine life being fun without you being in it. We all know tu bohot hi zyada smart hai, but what I want to talk about is how supportive and good-hearted you've been. Thode matlabi to sab hote hai XD, but the effort I've seen you putting for others (man it goes way beyond giving coding tests for others) is astonishing. Although life ki practicality mei kafi hagga hai tune (kabhi bag cinema hall mei bhoolna, kabhi phone, and wallet and ID card to bhagwan jane kaha hai)...but the way you've conducted your four years here, from your ideology towards it to your logic for living it, are closest to perfection. Your strength of character is astounding, jitne mazze humne tere liye I can't think of anyone else who could have faced it with a smile, and still be the buzzing, brilliant happy-feet. Know this for a fact mate that jitna devotion and dedication tune apni friendship mei dikhaya hai for all of us, utna hi hum bhi reciprocate karte hai tere liye. 'Aap -aap' karte hue 4 saal to nikal hi liye tune, ab Google bhi jaa raha hai..you're well on track on your plan to be the next CEO xd. Even after all our first year debates, fight club brawls and fifa el clasico's, you're the first person I would stand up for on campus. Although first year mei humne tujhe duniyadari sikhane ka try kiya ho, I will say this..never change. You're one in a googol, and the world is your oyster.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a6e3f0819323d199d491d5,Aditya  Mishra
4,"Maybe we didn't start on the right foot (absolutely no idea why that's the case), but I'm so glad we corrected it (bonding over maal ka perfect example!). You're one of the most fun people to have a conversation with and a really cool person to hang out with (even the sober me agrees). We've shared loads of stuff, from our branch, halls, debates and Vox to bongs, our love for beef, hijacking trains, sutte and drunkard dance steps. Convocation in Goa was extremely fun minister! And I'm thrilled to have had you as my Hobbes. It sometimes feels like you're one of the most wrongly judged people in hall 2, but I feel like I know you much better now, having shared a convocation at Goa and a very tipsy return to college.

5,"King of all trades man! IITK ka sabse talented banda hands down! I only really met you in 2021, but the fact that I've come to appreciate so much about you in such a short time speaks tons about your sheer brilliance. Masterchef Goa, Kanpur ka Da Vinci, Senna of SAE and a really sweet person. Thank you for introducing me to F1 mate. I'll forever cherish our memories in Goa..Hemant ki shadi, hijacking trains, almost being arrested, swimming with the fishes, living dangerously on Goa roads, impossible dark room games, perfect snacks and coffee, the best rum after a long trek..the list is endless. You inspire me to be a better person man, I've learnt a lot from you.",Kushagra  Gupta,False,60a6eb88819323d199d491d9,Akshay
6,"Mr Debater! It's been a pleasure debating with you and just hanging out with you on our pilgrimages to Mocha and Chick Blast. I'll never forget our beginning in Antaragni, but what followed was more than memorable. You are the most rational person I've met, and I sometimes think that you're a robot XD (constantly analyzing, breaking everything down). Hope you enjoyed the Rawat ki kachoris! We'll keep meeting in Berkeley, paas mei hi hai.",Kushagra  Gupta,False,60aa4094819323d199d4944a,Aman  Saraf
7,"Hello the-person-I-regret-not-interacting-more-with XD. I'll take this memoir to express my appreciation and gratitude, something which I may never have done but something you definitely deserve. You're one of the most good-hearted, understanding, caring, and hardworking people I've had the privilege to meet. Even though we never got to have night out walks or heart-to-heart conversations, I've always found your presence to be comforting, and I've always felt like I can talk to you about anything. I guess you can call it friendship at first sight XD. Our memories go far and scattered across four years, but what I'll remember you is watching you being the best person in IITK. I'll remember walking into Abhishek's room and finding you consoling him, or meeting you outside CCD being a great friend to Ankit, or always being there for Hemant, and these are the moments that have defined you for me. You inspire me with your dedication to go that extra mile for things you care about, be it your friends or CWC or simply your point of view. You've always been supportive of me, and encouragement from you is extra sweet because I know it's coming from an amazing person. If it were up to meet and the rules permitted, I'd nominate you for every Gymkhana award there is.  We still have time before we get busy with life outside IITK, we'll do everything we missed on our next trip. 

P.S. - I hope the shirt reminds you of our friendship. 
P.P.S. - This is coming from drunk Kushagra to drunk Ananya, we know we're the most fun drunk people ever :).",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60aab17c659165b3aa644d5d,Ananya  Goswami
