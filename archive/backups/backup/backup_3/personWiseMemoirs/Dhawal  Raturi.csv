Baat baat pr ""Wah sir!"" ke tumhare naare aaj tk yaad hai😂😂 Bhai kise pata tha humaara saath RJ1 se leker Hall 03 tk rahega? Khair yehi life ki khubsurati hai. RJ1 mai socha nhi tha dono same college mai aaenge, same hostel to chod hi do. Pr tum same hostel mai aae to accha laga bhai. Kabhi kabhi aise hi mess mai ya quad mai mulaakat ho jaati thi tumse, 2 4 baatein ho jaati thi, accha lagta tha. Bhai jindagi mai aise hi mst rehna, jaha jaana chill rehna. Bhulna mt bhai, kya pata kal kahi phr mulaakat hogi. Tb tk stay safe, stay happy bhai!!! Will miss you!",Dhawal  Raturi,True,60a54419819323d199d4847e,Abhishek  Maddheshiya

3,"Hello Pal! Kaisa hai bro? 
Having you in the same college was probably the best thing that happened to me in these four years. Our bond goes back to school when you joined it in 2012. 10th tk mai terko khaas nhi jaanta tha but 11th se tumne reputation bna hi li thi A section ke sbse chaapu launde waali 😂😂😂. Phr 12th mai thodi baat hoti rehti thi ki haa yar IIT jaana hai dono ne. Mujhe yaad hai 12th mai, Sunday breakfast ke baad kabhi kabhi tu Singh house ke saamne aaya krta tha aur vaha hum yehi discuss krte the ki yar bs IIT hojaae. 
When we passed out from school, I never thought that we’d still get the chance to see each other for at least the next five years. We got so lucky. 
Fortunately, we got the same batch in Resonance and so I had a friend in RJ1. Kota mai times kaafi hard the yar mentally but having you by my side in classes really helped me get through them. Hum class mai aksar saath baithte the and it was so much fun, pata nhi 1.5 1.5 ghante ke lectures kaise jhele humne bhai😅😅😅 Kher jaise bhi jhele, they were worth it. Mujhe abhi bhi yaad aata hai kaise hum 15 min break hota tha jo classes ke beech, usme 5th floor pe jaake patties khaya krte the, Allen kee sheets pe 😂. Kota mai mai tere room bhi aksar aaya karta tha, specially Diwali ke baad se, aur bhut accha lagta tha yar vaha aake. Hum sab jb bahar khana khaane jaate the, vo tea breaks and bahar se paneer laake room pe khaana. Tumhare heater mai roti pe ghee lagake paratha bnana. It was all so much fun. Kabhi kabhi jb Kota yaad aata hai, aisa lagta hai vo din bhut mst the (aisa us time kabhi socha nhi tha ki ye din bhi yaad aaenge 😂). Pr baat yehi hai ki vo din islie yaad aate hai kyunki bhai humne saath mai itne maje jo kie. 
Phr bhagwaan ki dua se hum IITK aagye, jo ki bhut hi mst hua yar. Tune mujhe starting ke  days mai cycle road pe chalana sikhaya tha 😂, aaj ke din ye bhut hi simple sound krra hai mujhe but then it was a big deal for me. Hum un 2 3 din campus ke round maara krte the and it was so much fun. Tu mujhe kehta rehta tha, “ Peeche waala break maara kar, aage waale break se phisal skte hai”. Million dollar advice hai bhai ye, iss advice ki vajah se hi mai 4 saal IITK mai salamati se cycle chalata raha, including barsaat mai bhi. 
First year kaafi sahi nikla yar, hum class mai saath baith paate the, courses bhi same the aur kaafi accha lagta tha. Merko yaad hai ek baar August mai bhut baarish hui thi, roads pe paani bhara hua tha and mera chashma toot gya tha, to tu mere saath Kanpur city aaya tha chashma banwaane. Thankyou so much for that bro. Mujhe pata tha kit ere alawa koi nhi hai jo mere saath aaega and islie maine bs tujhe call kia. 
Phr hume ek din OAT mai Shekhar bsb mil gye and tu Hockey mai chala gaya. Bhai I am so happy that you found hockey, vaha tujhe bhut naye bande mile and you had the chance to grow so much with them. You found a family there and got a reason to work hard, stay fit and you found a purpose overall. Haa tu humesha khush nhi tha hockey mai, kabhi kabhi bhut frustrate ho jaata tha politics se aur Inter-IIT jaane ki team list se, but overall kaafi accha raha tere lie. Khaali room pe baithke dimaag kharab hi hota hai, ye tune jo 1 sem hockey miss kia us time dekh hi lia hoga. I personally think hockey helped you build a great personality. Tu pehle kaafi shy tha, ab sbse easily baat kr leta hai and indirectly hockey brought you many opportunities like working in Council and Udhgosh. 
2nd and 3rd year mai kaafi mulakaat hui and kabhi kabhi bahar party pe bhi jaaya krte the hum Shekhar bsb ke saath. Kaafi maja aata tha. Mai kbhi kbhi tere room pe aa jaata tha, aur kbhi kbhi hum tere wing ki chatt pe baith jaate the. Yar mst memories hai ye, humaari baatein bhut masaledaar rhi hai humesha 😂😂😂 and mujhe yaad aaengi mujhe. Koi nhi ab phone pe baat krenge jb tk mil nhi paaenge. 
Kota and IITK mai tu mera support system tha bro. Jab bhi mera dimaag kharab hota tha from the pressure, stress ya koi aur baat hoti thi, mai tujhi ko sbse pehle batata tha and you were always there for me and never used to turn me away. You always listened to me patiently before giving me any advice. Thankyou so much for that bro!
You have worked very hard in life, Anshuman. Even Ghorakhal aane se pehle se hi tu bhut mehnat krta aara hai. Jo tu 3rd class mai Olympiad mai rank laaya tha use bhi pehle se. And you have also achieved so much in life because of that and the many sacrifices you have made along the way. At times, life will get tougher bro, specially with the UPSC preparation, but tu himmat mt haarna bhai. Kuch bhi ho jaae lage rehna. Mai tere alaawa aur kisiko nhi jaanta jo itna deserve krta hai UPSC nikaalna. And I know you will work very very hard for it. I believe in you with all my heart. Mujhe pata hai a few years down the line you will make it. It will be so great to see you succeed again and again in life. So keep going. Jaada kabhi stress ho to I am only one call away bhai. Vaise bhi itni koi dikkat nhi hai, mai call krta rahunga tujhe time to time. 
Wishing you an awful lot of success, fulfilment and prosperity in life bro. Stay healthy and happy forever. Aur haa, keep smiling bhai. Terpe smiling face hi jachta hai. 
Keep in touch bro. (Goobye nhi kehra kyunki hum humesha milte rahenge.)

The first great moment we had, that I remember, was when I returned a bit early to the campus because of SG duties at the start of secod year. A few days, we just played PUBG in Deepak's room in 3bot. It was so wonderful. After that you helped me a lot through thermodynamics in third sem, thanks bro mujhe tables kaise pdte hai thermo ki ye sikhane ke lie. And also for the Netflix😂😂😂
Bro in these few years that I have known you, I was everyday moved by your level of commitment and dedication to your work. You have this hunger that many of us can only dream of sustaining and I am so happy that it has paid off so well for you. Congrats on your Zomato package bhai !

Although you weren't always contributing 😜😜, it was great to have you in the TA project team in the second year. You are cool bro, a great guy to have small chats with. And so we did, the numerous times in mess when we ate together and other times about the tragedy of having MnSC as our major, lol. We even had the same alumni buddy for a while ( who you'd stopped calling and used to asked me about you 😂😂😂, like where did Chindrala vanish?).

Yo Dewansh bhai! Kya haal hai? Bhai kaha se shuru karu samajh nhi aara😂😂

I just want to say that I am so grateful that our paths crossed in these four years. PE101 &102 mai same group mai hone se lekar basketball tk tere saath jo time spend kia vo humesha mst hi raha yar. Asli maja lekin summer camp mai aaya. Summer camp mai humne khub maje kie saath mai aur khub bonding bhi hui. Basketball court se hum thake haare vaapas aate the aur haste haste din nikaal dete the. Summer camp mere in 4 saalo mai sbse best time tha and you were one of the reasons for it. Summer camp ka time yaad krta hu to aisa lagta hai jaise camp koi sapna tha, kyunki hum us time bs khaate, khelte aur soya krte the. But vo time bhut mst tha yar aur jo humaari team thi vo bhi sb mst bnde the. 

Acads ki wajah se basketball continue nhi kr paae 2nd year Udhgosh ke baad se but dost to humesha hi rahenge. Summer camp ke baad kaafi baar mulakaat hui, kabhi OAT mai, kbhi acads area mai aur 1 2 baar mai tere room ki taraf bhi aaya tha. Mulaakat to jitni hui, km hi hui but I am happy ki mulaakate hoti rahi. 

Fourth year jo 10 12 din mai saath basketball khela (March ’21 mai), bhut accha laga. Aisa laga jaise we were reliving the whole Summer Camp experience again. We were so lucky ki between the first and the second wave, 50 din hi sahi but campus khula and graduation se pehle ek baar milne kaa mauka mila hume!  Basketball khelne ka alag hi maza tha IITK mai. 1 1.5 ghanta jb court pe hote the, aisa lagta tha jaise apni saari problems kuch time ke lie gaayab hogyi ho.

Bhai, thank you so much for all the experiences that we had together. It has been so much fun to know you. I will miss you and our Snapchat streak a lot (I can’t believe we went up to 100 days!!!). I wish you all the success in the world bhai. Mujhe ye belief hai ki tu life mai jo karega mst krega bro. May you find your purpose and have a fulfilled, successful and prosperous life.

Hello Jay bhai! Humaari branches bhi different thi aur hall bhi. It was so unlikely that we’d ever cross paths in these four years, but I am glad that we did, thanks to basketball. The first time I talked to you was on the basketball court during one of the CPA practice sessions. We didn’t talk much in the first year but summer camp mai we became great friends (we’ll always be great friends). 

Bhai summer camp mere in 4 saalo mai sbse best time tha and you were one of the reasons for it. Summer camp ka time yaad krta hu to aisa lagta hai jaise camp koi sapna tha, kyunki hum us time bs khate, khelte aur soya krte the. But vo time bhut mst tha yar aur jo humaari team thi vo bhi sb mst bnde the. Acads ki wajah se basketball continue nhi kr paae 2nd year Udhgosh ke baad se but dost to humesha hi rahenge. Ek baar tu aur mai raat ko cycle pe nikle the campus mai ghoomne, kaafi baari oat mai party bhi ki aur kabhi kabhi tu Ujjwal se milne aaya krta tha hall to mulaakat ho jaati thi. Pr jitni mulaakat hui, km hui yar. But jitni bhi hui unhike lie mai grateful hu.

Fourth year mai same hall mai to reh nhi paae but jo 10 12 din March ’21 mai saath basketball khela, bhut accha laga. Aisa laga jaise we were reliving the whole Summer Camp experience again. Basketball khelne ka alag hi maza tha IITK mai. 1 1.5 ghanta jb court pe hote the, aisa lagta tha jaise apni saari problems kuch time ke lie gaayab hogyi ho.

I wish you all the success in the world bhai. May you find your purpose and have a fulfilled and prosperous life. Stay healthy and happy. Take care bhai. Mst mst playlist share krte rehna.

It was worthwhile to have you, Aditya and Shubham in the adjacent room in the freshman year. The memories that we made in that short time itself are priceless. I remember that time when a bunch of 3rd years from 2-Bot caught us so happy that they couldn’t bear it and took us to the lawn and asked me to sing and you to dance to it. I never told you, but I was terrified that night and the only reason I felt safe was that you were there with me and I thought, I have my friend by my side and whatever happens, we’ll get through this together. Contrary to our apprehension, the night took a rather hilarious turn, and we got an anecdote to laugh our asses off for the rest of our lives. I remember those numerous nights, when you, Shubham and I used to get together and mess with anyone we could possibly find in the wing (mostly, Tamonud – Sorry Tamonud!) and used to make so much noise that Aditya could never sleep. And I remember the night before the PHY103 midsem when we pulled a night out in CC and you helped me get through all the tutorials and notes so that I could pass the next day. And I did. 

I remember the few but glorious trips that we took to BBQ or malls to watch a movie. Also, the time you and Tamonud treated the whole wing there (We love you for it!). I remember the time we watched Avengers: Infinity War (me, you, Aditya and Tamonud) and had to walk kilometres afterwards to find a ride back to college (What a day it was!). 

I remember the times in the sophomore, junior and senior years when I called on you for advice and guidance and you never turned me away, and the times you watched out for me when I was crashing academically. I also remember the innumerable times you helped me find greater clarity about my life and the times you saw me through my various never-ending crises and ever-recurring crossroads. 
I thank you for every one of these times. Thank you for being by my side, thank you for taking the time, thank you for every one of your advice, thank you for all the fun times, thank you for everything. 

Lastly, may I add how breath-taking it was to have had the chance to watch you grow and become this fabulous individual that you have become. That stooped, awkward kid that walked uneasily through the gates of Hall 03 in July 2017, inconfident, is now this confident, mature and more-learned-than-ever leader that is walking out head held high with a blazing charisma, having touched and enriched hundreds of lives, including mine. The way that you have lived these four years, fully and joyfully, inspires me and will continue to inspire me throughout my life. It is an honour to know you and have you as my bhai.

Contrary to our apprehension, the night took a rather hilarious turn, and we got an anecdote to laugh our asses off for the rest of our lives. I remember those numerous nights, when you, Shubham and I used to get together and mess with anyone we could possibly find in the wing (mostly, Tamonud – Sorry Tamonud!) and used to make so much noise that Aditya could never sleep. And I remember the night before the PHY103 midsem when we pulled a night out in CC and you helped me get through all the tutorials and notes so that I could pass the next day. And I did. 
I remember the few but glorious trips that we took to BBQ or malls to watch a movie. Also, the time you and Tamonud treated the whole wing there (We love you for it!). I remember the time we watched Avengers: Infinity War (me, you, Aditya and Tamonud) and had to walk kilometres afterwards to find a ride back to college (What a day it was!). 
I remember the times in the sophomore, junior and senior years when I called on you for advice and guidance and you never turned me away, and the times you watched out for me when I was crashing academically. I also remember the innumerable times you helped me find greater clarity about my life and the times you saw me through my various never-ending crises and ever-recurring crossroads. 
I thank you for every one of these times. Thank you for being by my side, thank you for taking the time, thank you for every one of your advice, thank you for all the fun times, thank you for everything. 
Lastly, may I add how breath-taking it was to have had the chance to watch you grow and become this fabulous individual that you have become. That stooped, awkward kid that walked uneasily through the gates of Hall 03 in July 2017, inconfident, is now this confident, mature and more-learned-than-ever leader that is walking out head held high with a blazing charisma, having touched and enriched hundreds of lives, including mine. The way that you have lived these four years, fully and joyfully, inspires me and will continue to inspire me throughout my life. It is an honour to know you and have you as my bhai. I was very lucky that our paths crossed and I, whole-heartedly and unconditionally, wish you the best in life. May you be a thousand times more successful than anyone who has ever lived, and may you rise to your full potential, because you are INFINITE my friend.

4 saal kaise nikle pata hi nhi chala yar. But ye accha hua ki hume tum mil gye. First year mai saath basketball khela lekin main bonding to summer camp mai hui. Yar tu mai aur Ramola roomies the islie summercamp kaafi mst gaya. IITK ka sbse mst time tha vo, khao, khelo, so jaao. Us time pe humne khub bulla bhi kaata. Mujhe aaj tk yakeen nhi hota ki us garmi mai, tu top floor pe Jeans pehenke kaise so jaata tha yar 😅 😅 😅, tune isse ye proof krdia ki tu Kota vaasi hai😂😂😂. Aur ha tu to Resonance mai bhi tha though hum kabhi vaha mil nahi paae, mai RJ1 and tu PA1!
Summer camp ke baad second year mai 1.5 mahine kaafi basketball khela lekin uske baad acads ke chakkar mai chor dia. Kaafi mst time the yar vo jb hum basketball khelte the. Bus 1 1.5 ghanta hi sahi, but court pe khelte hue aise lagta tha jaise humaari saari problems kuch time ke lie gayab hogyi ho. It was so relaxing. 
Pandemic ki wajah se fourth year Hall 1 mai saath spend to nhi kr paae pr jo 10 12 din Basketball khela March ‘21 mai, bhut maja aaya bhai. Aisa laga jaise we were all reliving the Summer Camp days. Thank you for making the overall basketball experience awesome for me bro. I will miss you a hell lot.

32,"Yo Ramola bhai!!! Kirmola bhai🐜🐜🐜!!! Rambola bhai!!! Kya haal hai? 

Bhai I am so grateful that we got the chance to know each other in IITK, thanks to basketball. I found a great human being and a good friend when I met you. Basketball ke CPA trials se lekar fourth year ke end tak ka safar bhut hi romanchak raha mere lie and you were one of the reasons for it. CPA mai hum ek doosre ko 2nd sem se jaanne lag gye the jb tune mujhe bataya ki tu Tehri ka hai. Bhai usse pehle mai socha krta tha ki sirf mai hi hu 1 garhwali hu Y17 mai (😂😂😂 kitna attitude tha mujhme!) Khair, thank God I was wrong, I found a bhulla! 

Humari main bonding to summer camp mai hui and sbse jaada tere saath maje bhi usi time kie. Thanks for being my roommate in summer camp bhai. Dono pahadi 1 hi room mai the to jaldi se cooler bhi kharid laae hum 😂. Priyanshu ka scene mujhe kbhi samajh main nhi aaya bhai ki kaise vo itni garmi mai bhi top floor mai jeans pehenke so jaata tha. Warm up ke lie ma’am jb round maarne bheja krti thi to hum dono aage aage bhaga krte the aur baakio ki lagi rehti thi 😂 Camp shandaar tha yar, khao, khelo, bulla kaato aur so jaao. Basketball court se hum thake haare vaapas aate the aur haste haste din nikaal dete the. Summer camp mere in 4 saalo mai sbse best time tha. Summer camp ka time yaad krta hu to aisa lagta hai jaise camp koi sapna tha. Humaaari team bhi bhut mst thi, bnde sb chill the. 

2nd year mai Udhgosh ke baad se basketball continue nhi kr paae pr pahadi dost jo 1 baar bn jaate hai to lifetime ke lie bhula bn jaate hai 😋. Summer camp ke baad kaafi baar mulakaat hui, saath mai SG bhi rahe, kabhi saath ghar jaate hue ya ghar se aate hue (Kalpana & Shatabdi Travels jindabad!), kabhi OAT mai kisi basketball waale ki party mai, kbhi acads area mai aur 1 2 baar mai tere room ki taraf bhi aaya tha. Mulaakat to jitni hui, km hi hui but I am happy ki mulaakate hoti rahi. 
Fourth year ke last me jo 10 12 din saath basketball khela (March ’21 mai), bhut accha laga. Aisa laga jaise we were reliving the whole Summer Camp experience again. We were so lucky ki between the first and the second wave, 50 din hi sahi but campus khula and graduation se pehle ek baar phr milne kaa mauka mila hume!  Basketball khelne ka alag hi maza tha IITK mai. 1 1.5 ghanta jb court pe hote the, aisa lagta tha jaise apni saari problems kuch time ke lie gaayab hogyi ho.

Bhai, tu ek aisa bnda hai jise maine sbse jaada mehnat krte hue dekha IITK mai. Tu har saal Galaxy bhi krta tha(ek saal beard shave krke bndi bnne ka bhi gaurav prapt hua tumhe 😂 😂 😂), summer camp bhi kia tune, first year mai drams bhi kia tune, Hall 5 ka presi bhi tha tu and Antaragni mai bhi kaam krta tha. Ab tera YouTube channel bhi hai, jispe tu consistently videos daalta rehta hai. I think you’ll do great in the field that you have chosen. You'll be a great writer, director and actor. Bro bs kbhi mehnat mat chodna, thoda time tough hoga due to the struggle and the pandemic but keep at it and keep hustling like you have done till now. You deserve great success in life and I’m sure you will get it all in due time. 

Bhai, thank you so much for all the experiences that we had together. It has been so much fun to know you. I wish you all the success in the world. May you find your purpose and have a fulfilled, successful and prosperous life. Stay healthy and happy bro. Take care. I’ll stay in touch! Bhullas forever!!!

P.S. Congrats for the monetisation of your YouTube account. Chaapte raho! 

P.P.S. An anecdote from when you were a stranger I didn't know: Summer camp se bhi pehle, second sem se bhi pehle, first sem ki ek shaam, meri ESC101 lab thi aur lab mai 2 question aae the. Mujhe ek bhi nhi aata tha 😅. October end ka time tha, course tb tk kaafi tough ho chuka tha. 3.30 ho chuke the aur lab mai bs 1.5 ghanta shesh tha. Mai himmat harne hi waala tha, apne mn ko is lab mai 0 aaega ye accept krane ki koshish krra tha. Kisi launde se ya TAs se puchne ka koi fayada nhi tha kyunki koi batata nhi tha. But maine socha yadi 0 aana hi hai to kyu na besharam banke 1 baar puch hi lia jaae. Mere left mai ek gora chitta launda baitha tha. Maine usse pucha bhai, first question kaise hoga aur usne mujhe ek dum se algorithm bata di “ Bhai 2 array bana de, phr…”. Ek din summer camp mai mujhe terse baat krte krte chamka, ki are bhai vo banda tu tha😂 😂 . That day Ramola-Man came to my rescue and saved my ESC101 lab.

35,"Hello Parshad bhai! Kya haal hai?
First year mai to jaada interaction nhi hua but jb MTH ne hum sb MTH waalo ki collectively leni shuru ki, it brought us closer, and we formed this awesome satti-guys-waala group, and it has helped us get through the MTH courses so successfully. Over time, you became one of the more serious and consistent persons in our group and all of us started looking to you during our academically intense times. 

Bro, the notes that you wrote on your iPad by attending every class, every day, helped us more in our courses than the professors themselves. Thanks to your notes, we got through all the exams and the quizzes almost smoothly 😜 😜 😜. Every time that I was suffering academically (because of my own deeds), I always knew I could fall back on you and your notes. At times, it must have frustrated you that I used to miss classes and then ask for your notes and help constantly but you never shied away from helping me. I don’t know if I even deserved to be treated in such a great way by you.  During the Internship season also, I came to you for advice and guidance a few times and you never turned me away. Thank you for being so well-informed and helpful all the time. In my 3rd and 4th year, when I was having trouble committing to academics, your dedication inspired me and motivated me to try and work harder. 

You are a genuinely great person bro. I enjoyed the few parties that we attended together, like Shrotriya’s 18th birthday in CCD (I can't believe that kid is graduating at 19!), the BBQ party, the pizza party in Urban Clave and the party in Hall 10 canteen.I think the video-editing that you do as freelancing is so over-the-top cool. It has enabled you to buy stuff for yourself, including that wicked CPU that you showed us one time in the group chat. You inspire me everyday to work harder on my dreams and also, to not wait on them but to work every day to achieve them.  

Thank you for all you have done for me. I am really grateful that our paths crossed in these four years and that we got the chance to become friends. You are a hard-working person and I wish you great success, fulfilment, and prosperity in life. Stay healthy and happy bro. Take care!

P.S. It’s just my gut feeling but I think you’d do great in the business world. I know that you have similar plans for yourself already and I think you’ll be very successful. 
P.P.S. If I ever make some ‘big money' , it’s your start-up/business I’d want to invest it in.

36,"Hello Parshad bhai! Kya haal hai?
First year mai to jaada interaction nhi hua but jb MTH ne hum sb MTH waalo ki collectively leni shuru ki, it brought us closer, and we formed this awesome satti-guys-waala group, and it has helped us get through the MTH courses so successfully. Over time, you became one of the more serious and consistent persons in our group and all of us started looking to you during our academically intense times. 

Bro, the notes that you wrote on your iPad by attending every class, every day, helped us more in our courses than the professors themselves. Thanks to your notes, we got through all the exams and the quizzes almost smoothly 😜 😜 😜. Every time that I was suffering academically (because of my own deeds), I always knew I could fall back on you and your notes. At times, it must have frustrated you that I used to miss classes and then ask for your notes and help constantly but you never shied away from helping me. I don’t know if I even deserved to be treated in such a great way by you.  During the Internship season also, I came to you for advice and guidance a few times and you never turned me away. Thank you for being so well-informed and helpful all the time. In my 3rd and 4th year, when I was having trouble committing to academics, your dedication inspired me and motivated me to try and work harder. 

You are a genuinely great person bro. I enjoyed the few parties that we attended together, like Shrotriya’s 18th birthday in CCD (I can't believe that kid is graduating at 19!), the BBQ party, the pizza party in Urban Clave and the party in Hall 10 canteen.I think the video-editing that you do as freelancing is so over-the-top cool. It has enabled you to buy stuff for yourself, including that wicked CPU that you showed us one time in the group chat. You inspire me everyday to work harder on my dreams and also, to not wait on them but to work every day to achieve them.  

Thank you for all you have done for me. I am really grateful that our paths crossed in these four years and that we got the chance to become friends. You are a hard-working person and I wish you great success, fulfilment, and prosperity in life. Stay healthy and happy bro. Take care!

37,"Hello Shailabh Bhai! The first time we met was in the SG Orientation seminar in the summer before our second year. It was cool to get to know you and interact with you, though it was very limited. Thank you for convincing me to help the Prayas kids with the group song in their annual function in 2019. Thank you also, for presenting me with the opportunity. While being there for a week, I was moved by how much you cared for the kids and how much work you put in for their betterment, daily. I have great respect for you because of that. 
Also, I will miss all the chats we had while eating in the mess. 
Wishing you all the success in the world. Stay happy and healthy. Take care. ",Dhawal  Raturi,True,60a55770819323d199d48585,Shashank  Shailabh

Humaari sabse pehle baat hui thi jb hum freshers inferno mai Hall 3 ke lie basketball khele the saath. Aur uske baad to CPA mai milna hota rehta tha. 

Pr tumhe acche se jaanne ka mauka to Summer Camp mai hi mila aur hum kaafi acche dost bhi bn gye. Bhai summer camp mere in 4 saalo mai sbse best time tha and you were one of the reasons for it. Summer camp ka time yaad krta hu to aisa lagta hai jaise camp koi sapna tha, kyunki hum us time bs khate, khelte aur soya krte the. Court se thakkr aate the aur jb so nhi rahe hote the to hasi majak chalta rehta tha. Vo time bhut mst tha yar aur jo humaari team thi vo bhi sb mst bnde the. 2nd year ke Udhgosh se maine basketball khelna chor dia tha but dost to humesha hi rahenge. 

Uske baad bhi kaafi baar mulakaat aur baatein hoti rahi. 2nd year mai saath SG bhi rahe aur hall mai kbhi kbhi mess ya quad mai milte rehte the. Ek shaam quad mai 3 bot ke saamne baithke humne dher saari baatein bhi ki thi sur apni problems bhi share ki thi ek doosre se. OAT mai saath milkar, basketball team ko humne birthday treat bhi krai thi. To mulakaate to bhut hui pr kaafi nhi ho paai kbhi pandemic ki vajah se, pr jitni bhi hui, uske lie mai bhut grateful hu bro. 

Tumne basketball 3rd year ke end tk continue rakha and actually you were the only one from our batch to do so. I have huge respect for you because of that. You were always deeply dedicated to everything you committed to, from studies to basketball. That's why I'm sure you'll do great in life and will rise to your maximum potential. 

Thank you for all the experiences we lived together bhai. It has been so much fun to know you. You are a genuinely good person. Also you are one of those very few people I've met, that think about life in long-term. Always take advantage of that. Terse baat krke humesha accha lagta tha because you used to listen so patiently and genuinely. I will miss you a lot brother. I wish you all the success in the world bhai. May you find your purpose and have a fulfilled and prosperous life. Stay healthy and happy. Take care bhai. I'll stay in touch. 

P.S. PhD aur research krne ka sapna kabhi mt chorna bro. Bhale hi due to pandemic, situation thodi tough hogyi hai but never give up on your dreams, ever.",Dhawal  Raturi,True,60a64834819323d199d48d7a,Ujjwal Pratap Singh
