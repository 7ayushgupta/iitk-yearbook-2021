4,"I borrowed this one from work, and, afraid of doing damage to its white binding, I bought a cloth cover, originally no doubt intended for bibles, to protect the book from smudges or anything else untoward. That covering became symbolic as I dived into this memoir of hiding, transformation, and reversals. In the Darkroom follows feminist scholar Susan Faludi as she reunites with her estranged father, who is now living as a woman in the Budapest of her youth. Her father survived the Holocaust through disguises and subterfuge, then found refuge after the war in depictions of women on film; she is proud to show her daughter the life she has made in Budapest, even as right wing nationalism grows around her. Susan Faludi frankly discusses her struggle to accept her father, both in her estrangement and in her new life as woman, and reading the memoir of an old school feminist figure out how to be trans-inclusive is one of the most heartwarming things you’ll ever come across.",Sajal  Chaurasia,False,60a54306819323d199d48473,Kevlin

7,Bhai Antaragni'18 se apan ki yaade jhudi hai. Abhi bhi mujhe yaad hai ki tumne Akhilendra Mishra aur Surendra Pal ko kitni mushkil ke saath handle kiya thha. But bro tumhi mai vo talent hai logo ko influence aur handle karne ka aur uske liye mai tumhe bohot respect karta hu. Brandon Hill toh tumhe yaad hi hoga 😛.  Keep in touch bro and all the best for the future:),Sajal  Chaurasia,True,60a932db819323d199d493ec,Ratnesh  Argal
8,"Bhai EE311 mai tumhare notes ne hi bachaya thha(PS: tumne bataya thha ki maine momentum conservation ka midsem question galat kardiya thha aur mai oblivion mai chala gaya thha😆) . Aur TA201 mai toh bhai end moments par jo kisse hue, usme toh goosebumps aa gaye thhe. Sandeep Meena ka spring lagana aur presentation ke din half-pant pahankar aana toh yaad hi hoga😛. Internship interviews ne bhi apan dono ko bohot pareshaan kiya. But in the end, it paid off. Abhi aage bhi majje karenge bro and keep in touch🤘.",Sajal  Chaurasia,False,60af56fa659165b3aa644e52,Rohin  Gupta
9,"Bhai apan ki toh alag hi timeline hai. It started from PHY101 lab where you never allowed me to commit fraud😛. Then came ESO207 where I literally considered you as God😇. I mean someone getting an A* in such a course, it was surreal. Then came the monster course ENG123. Kudos to your notes otherwise I would have been forever struck in Freudian theories. I really felt it to be the most difficult course existing on Earth. Bc usme bhi A* kaun lata hai. In all, you are one of the genius and courageous human I have met on Earth. Aage bhi majje karte rehenge(PS: Samsung ke phones fast karne ki responsibility teri hai). ",Sajal  Chaurasia,False,60af9fd2659165b3aa644e60,Sagnik  Bhattacharya
10,"Bhai CS779 ne hi mera tera introduction karwaya(special thanks to Jinang and Vivek:)). Lekin jo experience raha vo bohot thrilling raha. From Dirac Delta deadlines of NLP to Horrible Midsem presentation to defending our position on leaderboard to defeating Duluth Grad by pulling a night out, it was one hell of a thrilling journey. Looking forward to more such interesting ML journeys:) ",Sajal  Chaurasia,True,60a6655b819323d199d48f7f,Shashank  Shailabh
