Bhai tum ek dam unique bande ho, apni achievements kitni subtly describe krte ho aisa tareeka kahi nhi dekha.

Me : Are baad m bhi chill h lg to gyi naa, thats important (trying to console 😅). Finally, kaha kitne ki lgi?
Gangwar : Yrr bs Sumo Logic hi mili, bas 1.5L/month deti h 😖😖.
Me : 😐😐😐

Last k months tum duusre hall m chale gaye (😓) vrna tumhara Rr sun n mei bada maza aata tha.

Chutki, chulbuli, chuhiya, ch*t*y* (kuch sirf tumhaari characteristics)!!
It was a great experience knowing you, ek chotti-si ladki jo har jaga ghus k sb ko apna bana leti h.
Once upon a time jb m bahut shy huaa krta tha, first year khatam hi hua tha and, Summers m you were a person jiski vajah s mai “The Bady group” and “The Dramatics people” k logo k saath chill tarah s hang out kr paata tha.
Tumhaare saath norml-normal moments bhi memories bn jaate h -
Priya ban k call krna
Water park waali trip
Juggling krna
Advises dena (Unse kaafi farq pada h saamen vaale log motivate ho gye h thore-thore) 
OAT m ***** and *** ko taadna.
It was always a pleasure talking to you and tumse baate kr k hamesha acha lagta h.
Tumhaara bholaapan aur humble nature baato m feel hota h and due to which hamesha saamne waale ka mood acha hi ho jaata 
You do it so effortlessly.
I hope tum hamesha aise hi hasti raho, jhumti raho, mast raho aur touch m raho!!

4,"Nare nare daa 😀😀, while writing this memoir I am feeling mixed emotions.
Ek taraf to I remember those 1st - 2nd years jb tum sb starting m u used to tag the wingies on Fb (this surely made everyone feel special) 💥💥, har koi puraani post dekho koi na koi wingie tagged hota tha and 
Dusri ore i can feel many occassions jb maine tumhe gussa dilaaya h 😈 .
To let’s keep this memoir specific to our 😇😇😇 initial years jb ham pura C-top wing was growing har koi kuch-kuch try krne m explore krne m laga hua tha and you, you were just supporting everyone (literally everyone!) 😊. I remember jb pucha jaa rha thaa ki who wants to be the wing repie, to ham sb (chutiya) log baithe huye the and it was you jisne iss responsibility ko smjhaa and volunteer kiya, honestly till this date you have been there for everyone of us and you have fulfilled this responsibility 😃😃😃 and uske liye i’ll always be grateful.

Starting m kisi k paas kuch nhi hota tha time pass k liye (not even laptops) tb tumne bahut atrangi gadgets (VR, Karaoke, etc.) se sirf wing ko hi nhi balki hall m hi sb k saath share kr kr k C-326 ko gaming 💪💪💪 room bana diya tha (vishesh bahut gaaliya deta hoga 😅) and I dont think tumhaare room ki strength kabhi bhi 10 s kam rhti hogi 😁😁😁😁😁.

Those days remind me ki how we always used to share cabs and board the same train 💨💨 and during the journey u used to teach me pyraminx (💪) and made the whole travel safe and fun.

I still feel ki you were not much interested in playing any sports as such but just to give company to us, u used to be present in the volley court, bady court, fatta ground. This reminds me once u sacrificed playing in OAT, mere saath shirts switch kr k 😁😁😁😁 (Well is din k baad maine shirts pehen na kam kr diya tha, kyuuki khelne m dikkat hoti thi). I know tumhe in moments/sacrifices k liye zyada appreciation nhi milta tha but they always meant a lot to me and others! 👏👏👏👏

You still leave me in awe 😲 ki how can someone be so good from heart, in swagy’s words “nareda tera dil bahut bada h……………..” 💓💓💗 (isse complete nhi krunga). You always acted like you have everyone’s responsibility and tried to spread happiness to each one of us. 

I hope now you start shaping your career (UPSC nikaaalo) and work towards your happiness.

I can remember how we once met at the DOAA canteen and shared some of our weird experiences 🙈🙈.
1st year Summer mei kabhi kabhi mil hi jaate the Hall-2 mei ya PE ground mei 💨💨💨.
3rd sem mei to kaafi instances h jab ham DS mei saath mei discuss krte the 🙌🙌 and when hamare dash bro tumhaare soumya bhaiya ban gaye the 😍.
Kabhi kabhi tumhaare saath night strolls ……. ❤❤
4th sem to awesome thaa I had such an amazing Bazarbatti lab partner (Nareda not you 😜😛), itni heavy lab kaafi chill tareeke se nikal gayi 😊😊😊
Well fir 3rd-4th year to kaafi saari cheezei aayi internship, placements and tumhaara support hamesha raha h in all these career-related events and I used to enjoy them 👐👐.

Tumhara dedication 😎😎 kaafi inspiring h, I mean the amount of effort you made in your 1st year and the consistency of your efforts is clearly visible in your achievements and yhi dedication aaj tk dikhta h towards your career 😀.
Yahi cheez dekh k to tumhe roommate banaya tha 😛😛😛, socha tha shayad m bhi dasse maar lunga 😁😁.
But in 2nd year I got to see your other side as well, mujhe pata chlaa ki how you used to complete all your assignments and quizzes and still make time for random bulla sessions 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 .
Tumhaare songs k suggestions aaj bhi sunta huu and they are amazing but tumhara standup ka material vo kevin hart vala specially, i’m not that big fan 😝😝.
You were always supportive in the career related decisions and I hope aisi advices tum aage bhi dete rahoge.  👀👀

Your memory of entering the room still remains afresh with me. Ek Ladka Banswara (iss jagah kaa naam phli baar suna tha tumhaare through👅👅) s andar aata h and tum dekhte ho left bhi bhara hua h, right bhi bhara hua aur almirahs bhi dono upr ki occupied (zyada choice mili nhi tumhe 😉😉), chalo pankhe k neeche wala bed le leta huu. 
You were the first person jisse maine apne baare m bataya thaa, we used to discuss ki kaha s aaye h, campus m kya-kya maze hamne kiye (😃😃), seniors n kaise hamare maze liye (😅😅), s*k*r* ke kaise hall n maze liye (😛😛), aur bhi na jaane kya-kya.

Saas bahu waale serials dekhna (🙈🙈)
Galat time pe h*l**n**  jb koi trunk lene aaya thaa (🙊🙊)

U were one room-mate jiske saath 1st year went so smoothly, never I had any complaints, hamesha helpful, and a good friend to talk to.
2nd-3rd years m we usually bonded over hall ka jihaad (😆😆😆), birthdays ki treat and sometimes volleyball ki heat, these time were a few (obviously not like in 1st year) but they always meant a lot.

The man who needs no introduction, aur sbka chahita.
I remember 1st sem m our rooms were close and kaafi time hamara saath m beeta tha (MTH aur PHY discuss krte huye 😅). Hamne decide kia thaa ki hr clubs events explore krnge and fir akele tum reh gye the takneek m domino game banane k liye 😁😁. 
2nd sem m bhi ham log baithe rhte the tumhaare room m singing ajeeb ajeeb songs, Mondal ki mimicry (vo BTW aaj bhi popular h 😂😂).
Summer m hui thi kaafi bakchodiya, seeti bajaana, PUBG khelnaa 💪💪💪  (well y kaafi lamba chala thaa and tum jldi seekh gaye the) and this was the time jb pure campus ko samajh aa gya tha kyu you were truly a gem and we were so proud to be your wingie💓💓. 
Fir to 2nd year s hii tumhi n electrical k courses sambhaale h, I remember ki course kaunsa lena h jo SRD l rha h (kyuki obviously tum nayya paar kara hi doge us course m😁😁😁😁) and wing m kuch bhi time pass krna ho to tumhaare room s hi start hota tha whether it was going to play badminton yaa IPL times or Antaragini m jaana, kisi ki GPL lena, paani daalna sb tumhaare hi room k aas paas ki ghatnaayei h. 
Fir aaya 3rd year and sb log ek dam serious ki intern lagani h and day 1 khatam hua, we were expecting ki somu bhaiya will announce a fancy company name aur treat milegi 😋😋, fir finally independence day aaya and ham log gaye NH91 that was a really good day. 
Forward to 6th sem, Elections aaye, bache bache ki zubaan pr ek hi naam thaa (Are UPSC chodho elections lado tum 😉😉). 
Well fir to Pandemic hi chal rha h tabse but still you take some time for your wingies and ham velle logo k saath time pass krte ho. Thanks for that.
I hope future m tum aas paas hi raho because you are the most dependable friend aur IAS logo ki chaaya sar p rahegi to hamara bhi bhala ho jaayga 😛.
