Idk tjhe yaad hai yaa nhi, first year me apna zero interaction tha, and tera out of random text aata hai, with Nilay ki photo (apparently wo HC me tha) and written ki ye tjhe yaad kr rha hai. Bhai bohot jyada ganda judge kiya tha maine tjhe, lol. Cut to 2nd year end, jab Rhythm or Mamnani ne Khare or Dange ko andar bhejke prank kiya tha apne saath. Apna next generation pe successful nhi ho paaya tha wo prank, but okay. Uske baad se to we have come a long way (or have we?). Your bio describes you quite perfectly. Antaragni on ground nahi enjoy kr paaye, uska dukh rahega humesha, but hopefully jab bhi hogi next tab majje krenge.
