Sailing through tough times, from sharing headphones to coming back Delhi in Shatabdi the stage was getting setup for the most defining times to come!\\nY-2: Well we become SGs! Then comes the reporting day and we cycle through the lanes to reach Hall 13 in a cold morning. Not forgetting the fact that you cycled standing up( bcz of recovering from a back operation) we accompanied each other proving to be the best of the brothers. The whole year was full of ups and downs & surely highs and lows :p but nevertheless the memories which were being formed were the ones to stay forever.\\nY-3: Changing circles, changing hobbies were underway. You became Core Team CS, i couldn\'t. I went to Techkriti, however, half-heartedly. Days passed and each of us explored our interests. We met but less often but the camaraderie was intact. We went high but not so often. Gradually, as a part of human nature, the circles played their roles and a point came when the circumstances created a misunderstanding which couldn\'t be removed soon. Facing consecutive lows, I was pushed to another place alone and away from the best of my peeps. Naturally, nothing was same. Not even the world which was hit by COVID lol\\nY-4: We have moved ahead with the same virus around us and now even more virulent. But, maybe it helped us to connect once again and did something which may not have been that easy!\\n\\nLol, if I see we enjoyed a major part of college together and I hope we are in touch in future!\\nStay safe\\nSee you bro :)","author":"Utsav  Akarshan","visibility":true,"_id":"607d6641b38952bbfbc68f1e"},{"text":"Ah...those days of romance. \\nJuly 22, 2017.\\nFirst day in IIT Kanpur, first time in hostel.
