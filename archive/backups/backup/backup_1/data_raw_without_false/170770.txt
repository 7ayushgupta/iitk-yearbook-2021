I\'ve known you from Punjabi Bagh days although we hardly talked back then. Never had a lot of talks or hangouts or memories with you but I guess we somehow have that bond where we see each other and we share the purest of smiles.\\nYou\'ve always been an inspiration, from academics to your fitness transformations.

I have always enjoyed wandering with the camera and you. The time in Bombay was probably the peak of our friendship till now. Watching the sunset quietly next to you, I think that we were talking with each other at that time without speaking anything. Do you think the same? That moment was a really special moment for me. All our trips and photo walks were memorable, especially the Banaras one. Although I used to get mad at you at times when you would ghost us during the club work. But those were temporary things. I hope that our friendship stays forever.\\nAlso, we should go on a trip together soon!","author":"Nupur  Mehra","visibility":true,"_id":"60a0e6da819323d199d47bc6"},{"text":"Our discussions on fitness, gym, acads etc. Learnt a lot from you.
