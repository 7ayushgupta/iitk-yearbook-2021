From being roommates to becoming brothers, we grew up. The first time we worked together was when you, me, Deepak and Tamonud participated in Takneek, though Deepak and you did most of the work:)\\nWe were the kings of EDMs. \'Hum chaar\', you, me, Dhawal and Deepak never missed an EDM. We were always there, dancing our hearts out, doing the most insane steps. Then we used to go to Events ground . \\nFor sometime we were even training partners under the self acclaimed \'Best Coach\' Dhanowa Sir and he made you do 200+ kg squats:) There were also some fierce badminton battles fought among us when you, me and Deepak faced each other in Room 127 badminton league.\\nYou were always the chill one, the cool dude who never gave a fuck, or atleast that\'s what most people thought about you. We knew that it was just what you made others believe even though you actually cared a lot.\\nAfter Deepak was taken away from us by the Gucci gang, you, me and Dhawal became the three musketeers. Me and Dhawal were the emotional kind, one of us was always feeling low for some reason or the other. You were our saviour, our knight is shining armour, who used to say \'chalo ghumne chalte hai, chaach bhi peeyenge raaste me\' and then we used to embark on your bitching journey with chaach in one hand and dark chocolate in another. \\nI really enjoyed going to the gym with you, getting all that gym gyaan from you and trying to eat as many eggs as you did.\\nTereko swimming bhi sikha dete par tu chala hi nahi humare saath swimming pool.\\nGeeky Shubham, you were the Technical Guruji for me, you were my go to person when I needed any movie link or any app or needed any help regarding my phone or laptop. \\nAnd your love for MasterChef and anime came as a shock for me, I would have never thought you would be into cooking and anime, cause from starting you were a \'pru\' gamer. I hope to see you someday in MasterChef.\\nYou were a great roommmate and are an even better friend.\\nAll the best and I know that you will achieve great things.
