Firstly thanks campus bulane ke liye varna mil nahi paate. Yeh point tu gina sakta hai abse jab bhi bolen tera presi banna kya kaam aaya. Vaise apan dost shayad first sem midsem ke time bane the. Fir shayad apan winters mein roz OAT jaate the na? Abe vaise apan first year winters mein roommate bhi the. I literally have no memory of that time. Haan bas yahi ki us time tak apan same level par the :p. And ofcourse you are the only person I envy at IITK. Kaafi maje kiye be apan ne yaar. Apan to us stage mein pahuch gaye the ki kuch bhi ulta-seedha ho to apan situation par haste rehte the. Kaafi exams ka saath mein padha be. Kaafi fun hota tha. Undoubtedly the most fun person at IITK tabhi tere se etne log obssesed the. Vaise tu sabse bada reason hoga ki meri college life single nikal gayi. (Not writing this as an accusation) Tere liye first year mein sahi mein respect aayi thi jab etne saare options ke bawjood bhi tu kisi ka kaat ta nahi tha (yaa thoda sa hi kaat ta tha:)). Also teri us party mein I was not sure ki it was water but since tu presi banne se jyada es baat se khush tha, I went with it. So, meri galti nahi thi. Vaise apan kabhi nahi lade be. Halke se bhi nahi. Debates hui kaafi random topics pe ofcourse. May be because hamesha galti tu hi karta tha :) fir tu directly/indirectly sorry bol deta tha fir khatam. This was the best part. Mein hamesha like 0 filter mode mein hota tha tere saath. Jo man mein aa raha, nahi bhi aa raha vo bhi bol do. Esliye hi techmeet vaali night ko tujhe koi content nahi mila xd. Thanks man for chossing IITK inspite of all the options. Campus ki best memories tere saath hi hai.
