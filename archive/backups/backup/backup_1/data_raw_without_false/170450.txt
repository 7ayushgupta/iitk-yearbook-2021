Humari maximum interaction batti club ke through hi hui na - even our first meet writing arduino codes during winter camp. You resolved LAN problem in my laptop. Fir summer projects in e-club - though we were not in the same team, you helped us throughout our project. You have helped me a lot in these 4 years - resolving random errors in codes, my UGP, research, info about courses and many more. Do you remember Ganeshotsav - it was nice and prasad was really good!

I consider myself fortunate that I came to know you and could discuss Electrical Engineering courses with you, that really helped me a lot in these last four years. I feel that you are one of the few Electrical Engineers from our batch that had genuine interest in the subject and research. EE370, EE381, EE320, Vipul Sir ke Music Projects kya kya nahi discuss kiya tumhare saath. It was always fun and insightful interacting with you.\\nSame wing, Y18 orientation, extended CS family, Room 234 and much more, we had many things in common apart from studies. I believe that our bond grew with time as all good things should. Hopefully, our paths will cross sometime again in the future. Till then, Keep in touch. All the Best for your future.","author":"Rohin  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60a6c4ef819323d199d491a5"},{"text":"I remember we had to make a group for TRC\'s course. I showed the list of the students enrolled in the course to Nitik and asked him to recommend someone. He recommended you, saying that you\'re too hardworking (no doubt about it). Hence, I asked you out for the group and I\'m so glad that we did it together. Our group meetings were more of a laughter session! \\nI had no contribution to the project except finding the book and calling the meetings, my write-up work was done by the \\"senior member\\" of our group himself. \\nI really enjoyed making fun of TRC\'s habits for the first \\"off\\" of the course with you guys!

I still remember us struggling to find the display room for the project in IITB :P. You were always so helpful and I remember thinking to myself as to how much you know. Then, we did the TA202A project. I remember us bitching about the team members we ended up with but still getting through the course somehow. ESO203 lab was a nightmare, figuring out which wire went where and invariably us finishing our lab work last before getting to know that the rest of the groups used to cheat :P. The last semester in AML you really helped me bro, I didnt know anything and you literally covered for me so much. I hope I wasn\'t too much of a burden. I would always cherish your friendship Bro. Always be like this, never change.

Tumhare jaisa banda kabhi milega nahi mujhe. Starting from the secy time, and the techmeet, it was a rollercoaster ride. I will always remember the bombay techmeet fun we had. After that coordi stuff and what not. Putting up with your bizarre ideas for club was difficult, but to last me hamesha karke dikhata that. That I liked about you, never giving up.
