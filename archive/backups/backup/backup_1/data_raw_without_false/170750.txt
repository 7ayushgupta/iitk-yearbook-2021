Poore CTM tenure me mujhe pata nai tha tu itna sensitive insaan hai lol. I always thought this is one rough guy who gets things done but no you are much more than that!! I hate ki we did not get much time in the CTM tenure to bond. I really wish we had met earlier. Man thode din pehle hi maine bataya tha tumhe ki sometimes when I talk to you it feels like dusre side se mai khudko text kar ha hu and that is indeed true. We are so alike!! All I want to say here is that you are awesome and I am grateful that I got a chance to meet you. Bro wo jo apna competition tha innocence wala wo pointless hai xD because andar se mujhe pata hai tu hi winner hai !! Just know that we WILL meet soon and we WILL have fun. Thanks for bearing with me when I was being super annoying on the helicopter building, or maybe in the DMs when I keep sending a lot of things to read xD. Love you man !!
