Do you remember by the time orientation ended. we both were as if we have known for ages. Hum dono ne kitna kuch saath kiya h( ok.. in most of these I forced you ) .Remember blood donation camp, kanpur marathon, antaragani pr, tera bilkul man nhi tha. But, this was the best thing about you, you never said no. Yaad h tune to apna room change hi kar liya tha in 1st year, Shi bakchodi hoti thi ( rishi ne tujhe romantic movie dikhayi thi .. xD., aur teri shaadi...) . We were going to become roommates in 2nd year, but I guess it happened for best. Our friendship hasn\'t been any short of roller coaster ride. Bc, Maine jitna tujhe manaya h, utna kisi  ladki ko manata to pakka pat jaati. But, here comes your best trait, you have  such a tender heart, and you are such an emotional guy, ki last tk aate aate to ulta teri tension hone lag gyi thi..xD. \\nYaar, we both have been together in some difficult situations be it during internships, then lockdown, and then placements( har test ke baad randi rona krte the...xD). Thanks for being a constant support and partner during these times... Aur haan, jab teri placement nhi lag rhi thi, I was very stressed ki tu chod na de, but the way u handled yourself was lovely,<3. Bohot acha hua ki lockdown ho gya, nhi to hum log ludo hi khel rhe hote placement ke bhi time...xD.\\nMovies/ tv series- When we first met, I thought ki preparation ke baad aaya h to isliye itna interest hoga, but the kind of dedication,you showed for this, itne mei to pakka dassa aa jaata...xD. During 1st year you used to be 7 hrs on the field, and the rest of time on your laptop( i have never been able to understand how u could do it). Yaad h tune aur piyush ne compete kiya GOT khatam krne ke liye( tu hi jeeta hoga most probably).. Now , i have understood this, movies hobbies(...xD) nhi h lamba ki, they are integral part of u.\\nSports- During the first year I was shocked to see ,how can someone have six pack abs without gym. But,you have always been athletic and zero figure. ..xD. The shine in your eyes and the change in your body language while you are playing is very pleasing to see. The energy that you put in sports is just mindboggling. You could play for 8-10 hrs a day. Starting a game in second year, and to become captain in 3rd year, is an astounding achievement. Yaar, mai to abhi bhi kh rha. professionally sports mei chala ja. You would be way happier. \\nYaar last 1.5 months with you was pure gold. Our photo sessions were lit. And that music event. ooh really sorry I laughed..xD. The way you keep the things clean, and in order in an aberration from college rooms( tu kitna emotional tha isko leke, teri aadhi fights logo se isi pe hui hogi). \\nGood bye to apna hoga nhi, abhi to teri shaadi bhi karwani h(waise tujhe ke leni chahiye by rajasthan standards..xD). Aur,I am already saying sorry for the things I say/do when we are in gurgaon. We are obviously going to have a lot of fun whenever we get there. \\nChal milte haan jaldi hi. Is baar to dassa pakka aa rha hoga, nhi....xD. \\nLove you brother.....\\nP.S.

Same coaching institute tha apna. Pr IITK m aakr hi mulaqaat huyi pehli bar. Pehle bhai bne aur phir sath m SG bhi bne. Poori wing m bas tum hi the mere dept se. Apni dosti dept ke courses jab sath krne lage tab jyada gehri huyi. Stata pe regression chlana, Somesh ka research paper likhna aur ab murli ke liye paper likhna, sab sath m kiya. Kitne ghatiya ghatiya course kiye apn ne sath me. Logon ki himmat nhi hoti aese courses lene ki. But apn ne liye aese courses. Some examples are: MOS, Numerical methods, Game Theory and finally IME. Last one was unpredictable. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that there is an ounce of possibility that this course could be this labour intensive (eco se h to eco ki analogy to use kre\xf0\x9f\x98\x9c) and shitty. You are the best teammate that I met at IITK. There were groups in many courses. But, courses in which we were a group didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel difficult despite being cumbersome. Somehow, we knew how to finish the work.  We just divided our work and there were no differences whatsoever among us regarding work. Through you, I get to know many of our dept mates.\\nOne of the best qualities you possess is hard work.  You genuinely put efforts to achieve your goal. Placement se pehle bahut chinta thi ki pta nhi kesa hoga, kaha hoga. But you never lost faith in yourself and emerged as a better version of yourself. Aur bhai ne phir ne OYO m placement lagwayi\xf0\x9f\x98\x80.\\nI highly appreciate your passion for sports, anime, movie and TV-series. You manage your time efficiently. You know exactly how much time to spend on study and how much on sports and anime \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c. Tv-series, movies ki recommendation leni ho ya Anime ki gup-shup, you are my go-to person. Agr kisi ko mere alawa saaf room rkhte huye dekha h to wo tum ho. You cleaning skills are far more superior than mine. Buddy, you have grown a lot.

I am giving you this advice because I know tum kbhi kisi ko disrespecting aur hurt krne wale shabd nhi bologe. \\nAs this is our memoir, so I wanna confess something. I was hesitant to tell anyone about my crush and the reason was that our crush is the same person \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82. Maybe it was childish not to tell anyone, but yeah it happened \xf0\x9f\x98\x82.\\nAlmost sare sports khel liye tumne. Cricket, volleyball, basketball se lekr badminton tak. Cricket as a CPA to captaincy of volleyball, you evolved. Yaad h tumhe tum Dual bas isliye krna chahte the taki ek aur Inter-IIT khel pao aur apni team ko jeeta kr le aao. Your intense enthusiasm for sports is praiseworthy. \\nYou genuinely care for your friends. They are like haemoglobin of you blood. Our friendship can\xe2\x80\x99t be described in words.
