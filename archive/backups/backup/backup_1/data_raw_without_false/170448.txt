You turned me from a beast to a princess without me capturing you into my Castle. You\'re the most selfless, loving, caring and warmest ( literally warmer than our hot water bag) guy I\'ve met. Still, I had my chilliest kiss with you. It will always come to my mind whenever I\'ll smell snow. Even your roses never had the thorns but only the sweetest fragrance of blueberries.
