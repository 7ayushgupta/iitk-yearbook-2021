Memoir likhna fir bhi tough hai kyuki bohot bhasad hai likhne ko dimag mein jise usually tu hi organize karti thi. My advice to all: Agar Medha ko sirf 25 percent bhi follow kar liya na to poori college life optimize ho jaegi. Kaafi chaapu hai tu aise hi rehna.\\n\\nAb sun, kyuki life mein sirf ek hi baar bolungi, you are the sweetest, kindest and PUREST person on this whole fucking planet. Pehli baar drying area ki bench pe mile the and ghanto baat karte rahe the, poore possible topics cover kar liye the us din, Fiitjee, Meerut, ex, KGP and blahhh. College life bhi humne usi tarah usi jagah baithkar end ki, usse better nai ho sakta tha last day apna. Bhale hi GALTI se tujhe itna door room de diya ho par vo kabhi bhi reason nai raha mere na aane ka. Tera room apne jaisa lagne laga tha. Kahi se bhi aati thi to pehle D731 mein aati thi. Sorry(nope) for 11:30pm things. You are the reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate lockdown. Kisi bhi time pe no time limit vaale calls, millie/coco ke videos, VCs and many other things you did for me. Jab tujhe Bye karke upar aayi thi tab tera room dekhke realize hua ki it will never be the same. Kaafi time tak tere room ke lock ko stare kar rahi thi, hall office vaala tha na ki jo maine lagaya tha second-year ki summers mein. Tab pata chala firse ki \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not the place, but people\xe2\x80\x9d. And I got the best people\xf0\x9f\x96\xa4. Haan teri baat kar rahi hoon gawar. You know my deep deep deepest secrets jo mai kisi ko batane ka soch bhi nai sakti. You see through me like your white kurta(I love that btw).  Tu hadd special hai mere liye jitna tu soch bhi nai sakti. Poori Stats tune and tere notes ne padhai hai mujhe and seriously mere grades improvement ke credits bhi tujhe hi jaate hai. I survived on this campus because of you. \\n\\nMai literally kaafi kuch aur likh sakti hoon tere baaare mein par kahin to rukna padhega. Bina mile US gayi to mai kabhi baat nai karungi.
