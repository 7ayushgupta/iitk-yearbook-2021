Thanks for helping me come out of my shell, for giving the best advice, for being my go-to friend, for teaching me some really cool dance moves, for being approachable always, and most importantly for making me understand my self-worth which had hit its all-time low during the second year. I am always gonna be grateful for being able to go to campus for one last time have so much fun with you. I so do not want to believe that this is the end of my IITK journey but hey let\'s call it the start of a new chapter of my life of which I would really love you to be a part of again and so pls pls pls let\'s meet soon and stay connected ( Tujhe set up bhi toh karvana hai ) In the end, I think I have only one thing left to say.....Are you lost babygirl? \\nLove youuuuu","author":"Priyal  Bhandari","visibility":true,"_id":"6086e46f819323d199d46df9"},{"text":"Hand me that machhar racket!
