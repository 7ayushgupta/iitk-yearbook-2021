You were the first guy I met. First impression? Topper h, maggu hoga(how wrong I was at that point of time) aur egoist bhi( I guess I am not good at judging people). We were the only 1st year people in hall 2 who were living in double sharing(thanks to vipin). Yaar, I was so blessed that you were my roommate in my 1st year. Tune pura 1st year friends dekh ke nikala h, yaad h. Tu maggu to bilkul bhi nhi nikala, ulta mujhe lagta tha ki khi fakka na lag jaye( but aap jaise chapu kitne hi h). Pata h log bolte the, ki rishi bohot arrogant h. Unko kya hi pata tha ki tera koi filter hi nhi h. You were one the most honest and straight forward guy I met. Yaar wo night out with raman was class. Hum log first year mei har jagah saath hi gye h. Aur wo lucknow trip( tujhe kitni pyaas lagti thi yaar). Aur haan, koi banda itna time kaise nahta h( tujhe 45 min lagte the). Aur yaad h jis din tu nahta tha us din tu pura room saaf krta that( it was sad ki wo din jyada nhi aaye). Yaar I loved, you debating on controversial topics, tera sochne ka tarika hi bilkul different hota tha. \\nYaar milna to h hi. I really hope you find something that challenges you intellectually and you solve that problem. Extraordinary people like you take the humanity forward(in terms of technological innovation).\\n Aur to bas ta ta my ever confident,chill, first roomie.

The Dance we had in Titos brother!!!. Remember the promise we make to Ojas apan agle saal Amsterdam chalenge bc to keep that promise.

During the 2nd sem, i don\xe2\x80\x99t think we talked much apart from the aceds discussion, but our bonding started to increase when we went to \xe2\x80\x98Rishikesh\xe2\x80\x99 trip.
