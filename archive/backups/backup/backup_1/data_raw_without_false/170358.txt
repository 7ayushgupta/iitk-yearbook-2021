Genuine respect hai bhai tere liye. You also know that line between fun and work perfectly, ye bahut rare hai apne college me. You can also stand up to anyone and fight for the right cause. First year ki endless debates se leke third year ke political dilemma tak kaafi discussions hue and sab me bahut mazaa aaya. Mujhe to wo disturbing night yaad hai jab Abhishek apne ko thand lag gayi thi aur apan dono ko waha sofe pe sona padha tha. Dono trips pe bahut mazaa aaya bhai, aur maarte rhenge trips. The best thing about you is that you are always up for adventure especially jab Abhishek aur Swapnil bhi kat gaye the (remember the reference).
