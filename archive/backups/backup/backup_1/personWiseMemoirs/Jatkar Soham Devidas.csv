1,"One of the simplest and the most decent person I met ... or atleast I thought... Last year mai kya flip mara Gawds... Gawds turned into party animal 😂😂😂 Wish I was there to party with you Gawds ... A huge opportunity missed. Nevermind we will certainly meet in the future and have a crazy party...

Till then all the best Gawds🙌 and take care ❤️",Jatkar Soham Devidas,True,60a6708c819323d199d48ff9,Divyansh  Tripathi
2,"Wassup roomie ... I still remember the 1st day when you came to the hostel room and you brought religious photos with you... I literally thought shit he is one of those guys who prays daily 😅... Roz subhe uth ke nahane jata hoga... har ek lecture attend karta hoga ... Lol I was wrong 😂... My mom feels I have been a bad influence on you and spolit a good decent boy😂😂😂 

But all this aside you were one of the nicest and smartest roomie I could ever have ... Keeping my laptop away after I have passed out watching Friends 😂😂😂 ... Thanks for bearing with all my stupid parties and disturbance I made while you desperately tried to study. 

Hope to see you soon bhai and all the best for you future ❤️",Jatkar Soham Devidas,True,60a66e78819323d199d48fe0,Ayush  Kumar
3,"Tujhe campus mai koi aisa banda pata hai jo Inter IIT 2 alag alag sports mai khela hai ? 😂😂😂 ... The dream lives on 😂😂😂 

Nepali tere bare mai likhne ke liye ek post kam hai... 1st year se jitni bakchodi ki hai uski list bhi banana mushkil hai ... Roz rat 12 baje Canteen ki trip ... my chai lover buddy ... the person who used to call me in the middle of my dates to text his crush (bhai uska reply aaya hai... bata yaar kya likhu mai ... plzzz bhai 😂😂😂) 

Every single day with you was so much fun and memorable... Its going to be so tough not having someone who's door I can knock on anytime... to crack a lame colour blind joke (remember the gems joke ? 😂😂😂)

Bhai jaldi Mumbai shift ho ja yaar... kafi jyada maze karne hai. 

Hope to meet you soon bhai and all the best ❤️",Jatkar Soham Devidas,True,60a66be6819323d199d48fc3,Keshav  Soni
4,"I have to say the last 3 years in Aero wouldn't have been possible without you. From all the last moment assignments and jugads in Labs to night outs in library ...( hum literally library party karne jate the 😜) 

But sach mai bhai it was so much fun to hangout with you and our aero gang ... the amount of fun we had in lecs (remember Saderla's Lecs) the paper plane race in lecture halls and afcourse our crazy parties (I will always remember the 1st time we partied together ... The only person I have ever bathed in my life 😜)

I am just glad I met someone who I connected with and had so many crazy memories with.

Hope to keep meeting you Prianka and go on crazy adventures together in future...

Take care and All the best Bro ❤️

5,"You must be one of the most shant , shyest and sweetest Panjabi I have ever met... till you get drunk 😂😂😂.

Mujhe abhi bhi yad hai 1st year mai we used to hangout all the time ... go to the library together attend lectures together but I never caught your name 😂😂😂 and then we had passed a the stage where I could ask you how to pronounce your name and I ended up calling you Bahubali all the time 😂😂😂. (in my defense your name is difficult to pronounce 😜)

I am really glad we bonded in the 1st year you me and Anshul trio getting around the campus hanging out with each other ...

We do have another year to spend together ... maybe ...

Hope to see you soon bhai ❤️ and all the best for the future 🥂

6,"Teri _____ ki _____ se leke teri mkc, bh***** we all have seen you evolve 😂😂😂. Mujhe abhi bhi yad hai 1st year mai kitna bada chutiya tha thu... Roz Anshul room pe aata tha aur batata tha ki bhai mera roommate bahot bada chutiya hai 😂😂😂. But the way things turned out the way we bonded through our mini milli game nights .... I am just so glad the way things turned out to be. 

You are a really fun person to be around... thoda annoying hai but then we always need a chutiya in the group right ? 

You are one of those ppl who wont change even if the world calls you chutiya and thats the best thing about you.

Never change Bihari and Hope to keeping meeting you in the future ❤️",Jatkar Soham Devidas,True,60a667b5819323d199d48fac,Vipul Kumar Singh
7,"It was really fun listing to all the Yogi Gyan you used to give ... missed an opportunity to get to know you better in the last sem ... I really wish I could have come to campus but nevermind... 

Hope to see you soon and all the best for the future bhai ❤️",Jatkar Soham Devidas,True,60a674a0819323d199d4902a,Yogeshwar
