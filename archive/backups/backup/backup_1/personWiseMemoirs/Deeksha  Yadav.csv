From our shared courses to shared bad luck, we were together in everything. Spending nights in NCL/CC to arranging (doing :P) assignments to mutually hating profs, last three years were fun with you.
I hope we keep on having more things in common and apne haath ka khana banakar khila de plis🥺",Deeksha  Yadav,True,608a79ab819323d199d46fa9,Abha  Tamrakar

Topmost stair of OAT. A group of 4 people, 3 sitting, one standing and waving at me in the darkness.
This is my first memory of you at IITK.
We clicked instantly and have been in constant touch since then, and it feels really great to have a friend who hypes you up for no reason at all.
I can never forget the moment I entered an 8 am class in summer to find huge 'Happy Birthday Deeksha' written on blackboard. That was cutest and i can't be thankful enough.
You're so full of surprises and your dedication inspires me. TA project was really memorable with you.
We made great memories in last months at IITK and also had the strangest (illegal too XD) goodbye in campus, but that was obviously not the end. Abhi to Kanpur aate rehna hai tumhe and trips pe bhi jaana hai saath mein.
Wish you lots of success and happiness ahead.

Okay no spemming this time.
I know we haven't spent much time hanging out together but it never feels so whenever you're around.
You are so fun and friendly (adventurous too) and i absolutely love your vibes.
Wish we could explore more scary rooftops with cats climbing trees and branches breaking out of nowhere (damn that night was insane).
Wish you all the very best for future and touch mein rehna.

So many memories together, it's hard to pick what to write here.
Orientation group photo competition to galaxy, we've shared many days and nights of brainstorming.
HSS Galaxy'19 is one of my fondest memories on campus and I'll always remember the time we spent in your room and conference room. We made such a great team in Gupchup<3. Also thank you for bearing my impatience in the submission hours🥺.
Banaras would always remind me of you and your AMAZZZINGGG sense of humour.

You're the reason I've tasted a lot of restaurant and canteen 'daals' (not complaining XD). Thanks for being the ever-encouraging, sensible, inspiring friend.
From freshers' to X-Coordinates, we've come a looong way and hope this connection stays forever. 
I know you'll achieve great heights (famous hokar bhoolna mat :P) and wish you the very best!!!

Thanks for tolerating me for these 4 years (and aage bhi). You're the best neighbour and behen i could've asked for. I don't know how I'd stay motivated in my life without your ""chal na, tera to roz ka hai"".🥺
You've been a motivation, a shoulder to cry on, and imma miss rote rote tere room pe aana.

Sun!
(Suna)
I remember the first time we talked was to discuss your sexxxyyy haircut during group photography competition in orientation.
Fast forward 4 years, we are drunk and still discussing but not just haircuts *ahem*.
I'm soo gonna miss the ""saath mein padhte hain yaar and padha dena"" before every exam and then failing to execute it every single time. (Except Eng123 ofc, but usme bhi kahan hi padhe the :P)
TA 202 lab was fun with you being in my group. Also, Harry Potter is changed for me forever XD.
Planning and executing photoshoots was really fun and thanks for recommending that lipstick :*
Wish we could have gotten more chances to eat sandwiches in Priya's room at 2am but abhi to you'll be visiting *me* in the campus one more year. So, we'll have some more incidents of the coincidental trio. 

Until then, take care and stay in touch.
Also, vodka hurtssss.

15,"The Shashi Tharoor of HSS!
Big fan sir _/\_ 

Remember how we fucked up our ENG project and even the nightout at CCD couldn't save it.
The club trips, the galaxy nights, the movie outings, it was all fun with you. I love those deep informative discussions and I'm completely astounded by the amount of information you have on almost every subject.
You are already a professional writer for me and yes again, biggg fan sir.
Despite being together in so many things, it's a tradegy that we did not get to spend enough time together in campus. But we still have one more year and a lifetime too.

You're one of the friends i get along very well with and it always feels home-like around you evertime we talk or meet.

अपने पुत्र की आत्महत्या पर कॉउंसलिंग सर्विस को दोष ना देते हुए श्रीमान श्रेय जैन महोदय ने मेरे द्वारा prepare किये पूरे defense पर पानी फेर दिया, और यहीं से शुरू हुआ दो बहुत हद तक जुदा व्यक्तित्वों की जान पहचान का सिलसिला।
दिल्ली और रुड़की तो तुम गए नहीं, गैलेक्सी'19 में भी फ्रॉड ही मारा *insert angry cat sticker here*, सो मेन इंटरैक्शन हमारा कोऑर्डिनेटर बनने के बाद ही हुआ। Now that i look back, it's only been 2 years!!!???
इन दो सालों के इतने किस्से हैं कि उन्हें लिखना बहुत मुश्किल है, और कुछ तो तुमने खुद लिख ही दिया है।
सिस गार्ड्स से पूरे चार साल की डाँट तुम्हारे साथ 2 दिन में खा ली, लेकिन क्या ही कर सकते हैं, there's only one way to find out.
Thanks for kindling the love of old bollywood classics and introducing me to great songs (among many other things). Thanks for all the useless technology lessons (जो कभी इस्तेमाल नहीं होंगे) and all the valuable life lessons (ये इस्तेमाल हो जाएँगे)। बाकी चीजों का शुक्रिया अदा मैं समय समय पर करती ही रहती हूँ coz I'm nice like that.
कैंपस में 1 साल और जीवन में कम से कम 10 साल तो हैं ही अभी, so this is obviously not a farewell *Hhhhhhh*.

IITK se teen teen streams mein 'engineering' karne ki badhayi. Thanks for helping me survive chemical engineering and always collecting the marks stats for all of us :P. It's really fun being around you and getting 'updates' about campus.
""Kuchh nahi padha"" kehkar scoring highest in every exam, you've always been full of surprises for me. Just keep the swag and savagery on forever. Also, I want to thank your alarm for helping me stay awake for breakfast in the morning hours after a nightout.
