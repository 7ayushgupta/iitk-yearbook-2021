Yaar tere saat kaam karna kafi wholesome and accha experience tha.
Thanks for reminding me and calling me before almost every meeting. 
Initially, I was so scared if I fit in with all these chaapu people in acads team; I'm glad you were there. Hum dono ka team work toh sahi raha, GH acads team !. Also, how can I forget - logonke birthdays pe CS office sajane keliye hum dono toh super excited rehte the XD. 
HUL ke intern rejection ke dukh meh night walk pe bhi gaye the, ab funny lagraha heh. There have been many ups and downs, and we will reach where we deserve sooner or later!. Chaapu toh tum ho hi.
I wish you all the happiness and take care <3",Yashika,True,60a6c797819323d199d491b2,Abha  Tamrakar

You have my card and my heart XD.",Yashika,True,60a63da0819323d199d48c96,Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju
2,"Hi!
About that train incident, I'm sure you would have helped me too if I was in your position XD. But see, because of that, we have a memory other than placing chibird cards on the cycles during Midsem.

All the very best for your future :)",Yashika,True,609add04819323d199d479bc,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
3,"Hi Onbin,
  Yaar hum first year se jaante heh and kitne saare funny incidents heh humare. I'm sorry for not checking your treasure hunt request mail till second year XD. Our first interaction was that random DE dance compliment during mid sem and after that, we tried to solve a MTH102 problem the next day ( jo hua nahi tha humse :p). Uske baad toh bas TA202 and all the CHE classes. Pata hi nahi chala kab hum general friends se Super sober brozz to gold, silver, bronze bros to super attractive brozz bangaye. Thanks to you guys, I learnt some weird words Yonsh, smoll, nach-nandini and aarti wali birthday celebration. I miss all 4 of us going on treats and sitting together in classes. I guess I wouldn't have survived midsem/endsem night outs in the library or NCL without having some fun time with you and Nandini. Ohh! also you are my ISPP, but unfortunately, woh sem kabhi aaya hi nahi :'(.   Sound wave wala action kaise bhool sakte, yeh toh bas humhe hi pata chalta tha pure class meh. Also those Bhojpuri song suggestions XD.
   I had a perfect time in CHE because of you guys. Not just in courses but in general, I learnt to have fun in the simplest stuff possible. You are my silver brozz forever! (of course I'm gold and Nandini ko bronze banadenge :p) Aaj Kal toh hum teeno ke old photos meh bhi mujhe aise lagraha jaise meh third weeling karrahi lol.",Yashika,True,609c0434819323d199d47a1a,Abhishek  Sharma
4,"Hi Esha,
You are the perfect roommate. I have been in the hostel from my 9th standard, and you are the best roommate I have ever made. I am so sorry for the alarm sound ( scooby doo pa pa.. even I hate it now). My first impression of you was she would be super smart, cute and very cheerful, which you really are. I wish we could get one more EDM night to go dance like crazy. Thanks for being there when I was feeling emotionally low in my second year :). I loved when aunty brought those different eatables which she prepared in our room. Please send me the recipe, that flavour is still in memory. Other than studious Esha, which most of the others know, I am glad I got to know Esha, who loves dancing during EDMs and treats, does Zumba, chit-chats, gossips, and is very fun-loving. Of course, never start a year watching Vivah; we know it's going to be a disaster. 

  We will be in touch, love you a lot and all the very best <3",Yashika,True,60a41544819323d199d48076,Esha  Gupta
5,"Hi Ankit,
I clearly remember that Dakshana wala incident and I was questioning myself "" Am I really that scary? why are these guys getting scared ?"" But now I find it really funny. Yes! humhare late night discussions were amazing, kabhi kabhi kafi serious discussions bhi hue the like future goals, all the India conservative mindset and stuff.  But overall, it was nice knowing a different Ankit than that silent, studious Ankit from Dakshana. Also, Thanks for attending all of my midnight birthday celebrations ;p. Dakshana treats ke alava hum inspire session meh bhi saatme gaye the vaise.  Todi aur frequent pizza party karni chahiye thi humhe
We will remain connected, kya pata dakshana valley hi chale jaye dakshana convocation day pe :p. All the very best and good things take time, keep working you'll reach soon :)",Yashika,True,60a510ed819323d199d4833e,Ankit Kumar (Akhilesh Kumar)

I always saw you as a fun-loving person and Manisha ki birthday treat meh we had really good time. Thanks to all the CHM wale courses ke reviews, bohot kaam aaye heh XD. 
Stay Happy! ",Yashika,True,60a4026a819323d199d4802f,Chitranshi  Singh
7,"Hi Inshu,
I still remember that orientation ""Jab we met"" wala photoshoot and you telling me that I look like one of your school best friend <3. After that, we didn't really have other things or clubs in common, but you were always on my list of friends. You are the sweetest! All the best, and let's hope we get to meet again. Take care.",Yashika,True,60a6701f819323d199d48ff3,Inshu  Namdev

10,"Hi  Kiran,
First year meh toh kafi kam baat hui thi but thanks to Manisha! Tumhare room meh kafi aana hua second year meh, har baar toh manisha tumhare room meh hi milti thi XD. Thanks for supporting me in second year when I was feeling emotionally low. I am very grateful to you for letting me be your roomie for a week during mid sem break so that I don't feel lonely. Kafi treats pe gaye heh saatme, and it was really fun. 
I wish you are all the happiness! Take care <3",Yashika,True,60a7c4ee819323d199d492b9,Kiran Kumari Meena

12,"Tkkrh,
This is memoir part 2, first is the card.
Please keep sending me wholesome comics. I love them. Thanks for listening to me whenever I needed to share something. You have been my go-to person for the last one year or so.  Feeling happy, sad, excited about something, frustrated, want to vent out, angry or bored - Just text Deepak!. Also, thanks for the Netflix account and midnight gossip sessions. Antaragni ke time pe tere tinder account chalane meh bada maza aaya tha (my first time using tinder :p). Thanks for ameeronka chocolate XD. 
Feel good about yourself, you are unique, and you got a lot of friends.
Tere calls kabhi ignore ni karoongi, not even drunk calls. I'll be there for you always :)
Love ya... Take care. Milke pending parties zaroor karenge.",Yashika,True,60a6863d819323d199d490af,Mahajan Dipak Anil
13,"Hi Presi,
Thank you so much for being there; my HEC moments wouldn't be that great without you. With all the extravagent ideas, Diwali pe lantern bhi layenge, Independence day pe balloons se sajayenge, galaxy keliye dance room hi banadenge.. all these would be possible without you having my back and trusting ki hum karlenge saatme. Vaise isse pehle humne takneek meh robotics event meh bhi participate kiya tha :p. Of course Nandini ko chidana is whole different mood. Also, that video story that you confirmed with all its detailing XD (HEC things, you know what it is ).
Thanks for all the help during the interview preparations. We will stay connected. Take care and all the best for the future!",Yashika,True,60a55a27819323d199d485a1,Maitreyee  Srivastava
14,"Hi Manisha madam,
  It's already 5 years!. I never thought we would grow this close when we were in Dakshana. Maybe the best is yet to come, but I have seen you grow a lot in these 5 years, and I'm super proud of you!. 
I still have that card which you just dropped in my room and went missing for hours. That card literally gave me and Priyakhee a low-level heart attack. Itna senti card kon likta heh!, we literally thought it was a suicide note XD. You made my IITK journey special with all those endless conversations about friends, crush, fashion, skincare, and many secrets :p. You are that BFF who sweeps out all the toxic people from my life (All the second year incidents) and that friend who is single till now ( so bois your chance is still there XD) but has advices to all my relationship issues. You already got your Harry potter cake, so you know what to do!.  Aur kitna hi likhoon yaar, goodbye note hojayega varna. Tujse toh milne hi wali hoon and firse apne saare naye stories detail meh bataoongi XD.
   Thanks for constantly supporting me and for your delicious kettle wali maggie. I'm just one call away!. Three is never a crowd, but always a squad ( Yashika, Pooja, Manisha at Dakshana. Yashika, Priyakhee, Manisha at IITK)

Love you a lot <3",Yashika,True,609ae7ac819323d199d479bd,Manisha  Meena
15,"Hi Bhavita,
We have come a long way, vaise first year se pata toh chalgaya tha ki ab forth year tak toh yeh pakka dost rahegi meri. Even though we were busy with our stuff, I'm amazed how we could connnect so well whenever we spoke. I loved gossiping with you :p, taking out frustrations of batchmates, family friends, literally everyone. Every tiny moment made it special, be it watching ""The bold type"", numerical method assignments, birthday treats, first-year EDM, self-obsessed, that cute little hard copy of our photo. You have worked hard to be who you are, don't let others bring you down by their words. I am super proud of you and I'll be there for you always :). Love you a lot!!! and all the best.",Yashika,True,60a40be1819323d199d48054,Nalli  Bhavita
16,"Hi  Neha,
First sem was fun with you and Palak. I love our IITK family, itne unique log jo the. First outing to z square and the mandatory IITK entrance pic bhi.  Teasing you was always fun, and yes I'll never forget that night jis din tu bas english meh bolrahi thi voh bhi itne class and atittude ke saat. We need more of that Neha XD.  Modern Art assignment with Nandini being the ghost was memorable.
  I wish you all the best! Hope karte heh ki kabhi milna hoga. Take care <3",Yashika,True,60a66d26819323d199d48fd2,Neha  Chauhan

18,"Hi Bro,
I had a great time in my first Sem because of you and Neha. I loved my IITK wali family thing. I admire your flexible personality, energy to try everything, and you mingle with everyone. Even though our interest and friend circle was so different, I'm glad we could bond well. Even I remember the first time we went to Z square and also that mandatory IITK entrance photo.  Thanks for all your bits of advice during winter in my first year. Yaar humne toh DE bhi kiya heh saatme, but treat wale random dance are definitely more fun. While writing this memoir, I remembered the last meeting we had at the campus, in front of GH mess. Let's hope to meet again!

IITK wali behen <3.  You have the calmest person I have ever known. Batien toh kafi kam hi hui heh, but every time it was nice being around you.

22,"Hi Chinese don, pinky puchki and what not,
Bro, I miss you already. I don't remember how we first met, but I guess this Navodaya thing was common, and we started talking. Thank you guys for introducing me to K-world; I have got so many new crush XD. I love that we could take time to watch "" The bold type"" and gossip a lot about the relatable stuff. I would never forget your subtle badass expressions and teasing eyes ( even in the airport XD). But I definitely missed you, me and Manisha hanging out together and chit-chatting about literally everything. Thanks for the slightest but unforgettable memories and constantly motivating me to have lunch and dinner.  ( Next birthday ke liye saunf hi gift milega :p). Don't forget to reach out to your personal skin care assistant whenever you want. Hope to meet you soon! and love you a lot puchki.
       Please behen ki shaadi lockdown meh mat hone dena, I badly want to visit Assam LOL. Yaar, yeh Manisha ne kuch zyaada hi likdiya lagraha heh but see most of it is about K-Pop, bas words zyaada use kiye heh usne, toh mera memoir compare mat karna usse :p

23,"Hi Nach-Nandini,
  Yaar, thank you so much for waking me up for classes every time, even if you didn't attend the class XD. jaldi utke bhi iconic late entry duo hum hi heh I guess. I dont know when we became this close but it was like accha, CHE meh bas iske saat vibe match karega :p. Ab toh professors ko bhi pata chalgaya heh ki yeh dono saatme hi dikhenge ya satme hi project ya course lete heh.  Thanks for making my IITK stay so much memorable from amazing treats, sitting together in the class, daydreaming or dozing in the class, having weird conversations, teasing each other in library or NCL, helping in coursework and assignments and what not! I don't think I have any memory associated with CHE without you. Even the pandemic couldn't keep us away :p; we had a good number of video calls and texts.
   How can I not mention that chit that we dropped to your neighbour - this is one of the fun things I have done at IITK :p. I wish hum ek do baar aur treats and voh aarti wale birthday celebrate karte. Thanks to you and Onbin for making me find happiness and fun in the slightest thing like those strange Bhojpuri songs and twisted words. (Yonsh, gold, silver, bronze brozz, onbin, themks, smoll and funny stickers). Random photos that we three clicked in your room aren't just photos, but they have lots of emotions now. I hope we get to meet soon, and yes! Our old photos give me third wheeling feels aaj kal :p. You hold a very special place in my journey, and of course, we will keep in touch.

25,"Hi Utsav Akarshan/ Festival attraction ?
            
           Thanks for being such a fantastic person. I can't imagine how I would have survived CHE without you guys. I'll cherish every moment with you, may it be a weird birthday song, long emotional conversations, introspection on what we have become, what could be done better, scolding you for some stuff ;p, treats, funny photos, encouraging each other to do well, exam/ assignments, hectic labs...uff and what not!

I know there is a lot hidden behind this happy face of yours, and it was my pleasure knowing you so personally. You are emotionally and mentally very strong, but don't forget I'll always be there for you when you need something.

 Miss you and Take care. I hope we will meet soon. Until then, adios!",Yashika,True,6085cd5e819323d199d46de1,Utsav  Akarshan
