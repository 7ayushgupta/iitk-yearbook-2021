Bhai I can’t even imagine maine kitna saara rant kia hai tumhaare inbox mai. Itna sun ne ka patience mujhe mai to nahi hai😛. Maine tumse bahut kuch seekha hai, but obviously I’m not gonna tell you what. Summer kya sahi time tha. RM mai not so much padhai. Tumhaara shawl mast tha waise bahut😛. Ab mai kaam khatam kar lun , bye.

Lab mai tumne poocha tha, kya karna hai life mai. Mujhe wo aaj tak samajh ni aaya, na hi shayad kabhi aaega. Also stickers ko cute bolne ke lie thanks, kuch logon ko to pasand tak ni aate :// . All our interactions were fun. Stay in touch. 
Cheers! ",Akhilesh  Chauhan,True,60a6628b819323d199d48f56,Nikita  Singh

Kaisa hai bhai? Been a long time. Milte kabhi. Bhai humne college ke start mai kya maze kie the. Bhai maine tumhaari kam hi photos li hain, asli shaitaan patel hai. Uspe teri videos tak padi hui, aur barwal ki bhi bach ke zara. 
Best of luck for future endeavours. Aur yaad rakhna mujhko😛

Waise mile to hum winter camp mai hi the. But wo MTH102 tha shayad, because PHY103 mera 2nd sem mai tha😅. Any how , details mai kya rakha hai. What came out of it is important. Winter Camp was a lot more fun because of you. Milte jaldi kabhi!

10,"Yo bro, 
Abhi bhi yaad hai mujhe, tune kitna ganda ignore kia tha ccd mai😂. But chalo, uske baad it was a smooth journey. Teri wajah se mai Hall 2 ka ho gya. BB mila. Also, you gave me a life changing tip which I’ll never forget(you might have). Agra ke baad seedha goa hi hua hamara😕, but goa was funnnn.  To many more like goaaa in the future.

12,"Heylo Mr Cow,
Oe……………. happy bday.
Bhai bahut saati movies reh gayi and hum graduate ho gaye. Han bahut negative approach hai meri😛. But yeah, summer 19 was prolly the best time in the campus. And obviously the following semesters tooo. Bhai humne koi movie nahi chodi. Koi khaane ka spot nahi choda(atleast campus mai) , koi acchi dish nahi chodi, heck, we even went to a temple too(but haan uske baad movie was must). Waise to I have a lot to say, but mai bolunga nahi. Because words mai fitting accuracy bahut low hogi. I’m so so glad it happened and also sad because you know why.
On the other note, Nainital is “ON”.",Akhilesh  Chauhan,True,609ec819819323d199d47ada,Sparsh  Kaoshik
13,"Yo bro, 
Tumhaare saath to itna travel kia hai maine life mai. Hours count karoge to shayad sabse zaada hi ho jaaega😛. Ho to gaye 5 saal, but you haven’t changed much😉(except for very minor changes) . Always stay the same. Kind, helpful, pure.
Milte hain kabhi jaldi hi.
All the best! ",Akhilesh  Chauhan,True,60a6662d819323d199d48f8d,Sudhanshu  Bansal
