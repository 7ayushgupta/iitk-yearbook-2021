I've been on this site for 6 months: 6 MONTHS and I have never felt this wronged. It boils me up that I could spend so much time thinking and putting effort into things while you shits sit around (probably jerking off to cats or whatever gay shit you like) and make fun of the intellectuals of this world. I've bored you? Good for fucking you. Literally no one cares that your little brain is to underdeveloped and rotted to comprehend my idea...MY GREAT GREAT IDEA.

40,"Now you may think I’m crazy, but hear me out for a second. Upon ejaculation, a male releases 15 to 200 million sperm cells.

According to the 2010 Census, there are 151.8 million males in the United States. If 151.8 males produced even the lowest number of 15 million sperm cells, it would result in there being somewhere in the quadrillions of these tiny things, and that’s just a single day.

I know you’re probably wondering what this has to do with renewable energy, and we’re getting there now. Because of the sheer amount of these things, they could likely generate insane amounts of heat despite their microscopic stature, if placed close together.

My proposal is that every male in the country cums at least once per day in an aptly named, “sperm tube”, which is placed in every household and connects to an underground facility, where the cells are being collected in one big dome, which connect to another set of tubes that transfer their heat energy to every home in the country.

So what are we waiting for? We are using up all of our natural resources despite a perfectly viable, cheap, and renewable source living under our noses as we speak. You can do your part. Start protesting and make our goal known to the government. Recruit more people to join our cause. Preserve your sperm to make a statement. Climate change is a serious issue, and this would drastically reduce our use of non renewable resources, in simple terms, your cum can save the world.

Dikhne mein shaant lagta hai, par andar ek chupa rustam hota hai jo bohut hada shaana hai.

Tere wing mein aadhi raat ghumte hue, mere room mein aakar ""kya kar raha hai? hila raha kya?"" Ye dialogue toh bhulunga nahi

Wing photoshoot sahi gaya, milte hai, aaya karo kabhi campus🥺

The senate has failed us many times, but I know for sure this chairperson has never failed us during his tenure.

A chill and friendly and fun seeking person, PuBG mein bohut maza aaya, not to mention the Messenger group we are in.

Thanks for your insider info on things at campus, and your help in comp phy. And let's stay connected as we have always been!

Side note - Itna chota kyu hai bhai tu😂
