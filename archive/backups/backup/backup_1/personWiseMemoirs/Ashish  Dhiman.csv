Poore college me sbse jyaada time mene most probably there saath kuch bakchodi krte hue hi spend kia ha . Classes se bulla ,courses me ek saath fudge* up hona, body banane ke lie alag alag plan banana,the list is neverending. You are one of the chillest people I know.You have been with me in my highs and lows during past few years,Thanks for that.
One more thing -Bro , teri art skill boht cool ha , i could only imagine myself drawing something like what u do.
I wish you happiness in years to come and may our friendship last forever.
Apne paas to abi 1 saal ha aur😂, thodi bakchodi reh gyi ha.Love you bro!",Ashish  Dhiman,True,60a6a918819323d199d49164,Ayush  Bhorse
1,"Hey dude,
It's been amazing being your friend for which no words suffice. As a roommate, you were more than helpful, and a great company for hanging out. From GBM sessions in the fresher year to watching the cricket world cup on projector with wingies , we have a lot of fun experiences. You are among the most passionate, empathetic, and cool persons I know at IITK.

I wish you a very happy life ahead and may our friendship and memories live forever. Love you, bro!
