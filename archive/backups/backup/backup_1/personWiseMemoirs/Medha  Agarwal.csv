0,"I know you are everyone's Sontu but IDK why I think I have spent more time calling you Chotu, just for the irony of it. 
Yaar first year would have been impossible without you. Sab saath mein kiya - padhai, ELS, TA, aero, and of course A-603 ki mastiya.  ""Medha tumhare room mein bois hai"" always cracks me up, but it was so true; tu hota toh that hamesha. Thanks for getting me through ESC101; you know all about my syntax errors. You'll be glad to know woh abhi bhi hai. SC-II ki labs mein same harkate karti thi :P
I'll miss those Antaragini nights, random NH-91 dinners, and of course OAT hangouts. Those two years wouldn't have been fun without you.

I know we grew very much apart after the second year. To an extent, ki jab campus mein the toh samajh nahi aa raha that ki kya hi bolu. I am sorry for the distance. If I could go back in time, maybe I'll try to fix some mistakes. I knew you as the guy jo MTH mere se padhke, mere se zyada number lata ha and look what you have achieved now. Just keep paddling upwards like this. Kya yaar, I recall Goa mein apna drunk heart to heart interrupt ho gaya that. Koi nahi, another time!

I hope we meet again and relive those fun ""boondi ke laddu wali ice cream"" nights in Bangalore again. ",Medha  Agarwal,True,60a6abf6819323d199d49174,Aditya  Sonthalia
1,"Yo God! 
Yaar to this day I can't stop laughing at how much you resemble the Monkey King. I remember the first time Sonthalia introduced us, I took him away and whispered ""yaar yeh toh ekdum monkey king jaisa hai."" I remember how I crashed your and GJ's initial library date (when you weren't dating :P) and told her the monkey king thing. Thankfully, she didn't mind the similarity warna kya hi hota tera! :-)

I love how happy you always are and tend to dissipate that thing in every group. I have come out of our every conversation thoroughly amused and in complete awe of you. It was fun organizing GJ's birthday with you while you were fretting about doing the decorations all wrong. Chal I got a sick fire hazard story in return. Mujhe toh bohot maza aaya. 

I wish we could have interacted more on campus but jab bhi mile it was one memorable experience. Teri respect bhi bohot hai and tujhe dhamki bhi de rhi hoon - khayal rakhna meri bestie ka, bohot pitega warna. I really wish we meet again sometime. At least Singapore ghuma toh dena hi whenever I visit.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60a6a160819323d199d49139,Anany  Sharma
