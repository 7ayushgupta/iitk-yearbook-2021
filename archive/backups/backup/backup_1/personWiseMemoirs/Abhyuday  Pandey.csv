Humari dosti kaafi purani hai, right from JEE days. We had an awesome time in chatroom2004 discussing interesting problems.

Uske baad we really enjoyed at IITK, shayad aur karte but niyat ko kuchh aur manzoor tha :(. You were the go to guy for me for discussing assignment problems. Kabhi kisi project par collaborate nahi kar paye, but future me zaroor karenge. 

You are truly one of the most intelligent guy I have met. In addition to that, you have a golden heart which is indeed the rarest commodity. I am sure you will keep rocking as you always did. Smalls ups-and-downs are part of life and we have seen many of them together, even before coming to campus. I am happy that we 
always recovered from it together. Iss bhai ko kabhi mat bhoolna ...",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60a4ee7c819323d199d482a0,Aniket  Sanghi
1,"Anirban bhai, you are gem of a person. ""Koshish karne waalon ki kabhi haar nahi hoti"", you taught me this in truest sense. Saath me bulla katna, bakchodi karna, ek dusre ka mazak udana, treats, gaana, random stories, kharrata and what not. GPL me tumse zyada kutai shayad hi kisiki ki ho (arguably). Kaash kuchh time aur rehte campus me but niyat ko kuchh aur hi manzoor tha. I hope you excel in every endeavour you ever take up in life.",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,607e7879819323d199d46bbc,Anirban  Ghosh
2,"Hey Devansh,

You were, are and forever will be the Theoretical CS gawd of Y17. Your passion for approaching problems, both theoretical and real-world is inspiring. We interacted a lot, especially in the context of ACA, where I found an entirely different version of you. I hope I also get an opportunity to collaborate with you on research in future. Keep shining, Keep innovating. All the best!",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60a4efd0819323d199d482a8,Devansh  Shringi

""Oh BKL drams waalon ne g**** m***i humari.""
""Hatt bc""
""Humare Jaipur mein...""

Ye mehez lafz nahin, jazbat hain humare liye. Woh jazbat jo ab hain bhi aur nahi bhi. Thoda flashback me chalte hain.

Day 1 : Almari lock karke nikal gaye hum (:P)

Taekwando : kaafi chill marwaya tha instructor ne 

Room-Class-Chaabi-Bathroom : Aadhi samasyaon ka karan yahi combo tha!

Bloody Marry! (Bhai maza aaya tha uss din)

Mess secy elections (with me as star pracharak and manifesto writer)

CCD Parties (Loco financed)

Gin and Ginger party (purely incidental)

Mast bakchodi karna (random stories, discussions)

Tere Jaipur ke dino ko yaad karna. Tumse zyada achhe se toh hmko Jaipur ka naksha yaad ho gaya hoga. Yaad hai na Aakash Jaipur ke din (lol).

Kanpuriya traders : the thing we cooked up recently. But yahi ek constant interaction ka platform banega.

Ant mein, bas yahi kaamna hai ki Marwari dharm ka palan karo, khub paisa kamao (aur hume bhi kamwao). Kya pata ye Kanpuriya traders hi kal India ka top Hedge fund ban jaye aur tum ""The Big Bull"". Waise kuchh aur bhi karoge, achha hi karoge tumhari ichchha. Baaki baatein chalti rahengi, yearbook to mehez aupcharikta hai.

Itni memories hain ki list bhi nahi ban sakta. Fir bhi kuchh try karte hain --

""Bloody Marry"" pe bed se kudna (bhai darre the tum maano ya nahi)

Kambal ke andar BKL se chat karna, aur mujhe dono ki info rehti thi 😛

GPL agreements aur 7 RCR me bulake sabko dhona.

""Bhai Canteen chalega?"" 2 ghante me endsem aur 0 prep pe bhi kabhi negative response nahi.

GTA V was lubb. Kab subah ho jaati thi bakchodi karte karte yaad bhi nahi rehta tha.

Teri namkeen Neemuch waali masha allah. Kabhi snacks ki kami nahi mehsus hoti thi. Canteen band hone ke baad bhi tere pass aate the stock ke liye.

Tere room pe late night party aur movie! Yaad hai na? Dictator movie. Aur bhi kitni movie dekhte agar ye covid na aata.

Dosa ke liye Sunday ko line lagana (lol).

Lucknow me aur bakchodi kar skte the but time constraint ne maara.

Tum toh ek saal aur ho campus me. Hopefully memories banana. Jo bhi karoge (Industry, UPSC ya research) achha karoge, bharosa hai. Best wishes for your future. Humesha yaad rkhna! ",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,608d763a819323d199d47670,Parth  Luwaria
