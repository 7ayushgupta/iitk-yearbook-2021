1,"Hello Ashutosh, you are really a good friend of mine😁. It was fun discussing the lecture doubts with you on whatsapp as well as on call. Also you really were helpful in doing project reports of CE451A. All the best for your future and let's see where our paths meet. 🤟🏻",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a63168819323d199d48bce,Ashutosh  Ranjan
2,"Hey, Although we met few months back but our friendship grew exponentially. The goa trip was the best with you guys along🤩.Although you were a little hesitant initially before driving, but you are a pro👌🏻 in it. Back to campus time was the best spent with you all, be it playing UNO, listening to music, exploring campus or late night talks. Outreach's rooftop was the best hangout place. 
Looking forward to plan something and meet you all again. All the best for your future endeavours.❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a4fd1a819323d199d482d8,Atishay  Shrivastava

4,"Yo! At first we met during fashion show. Then, we were in the same team in Udghosh which we successfully conducted amidst lots of fun. The dart 🎯 games in B107, interviewing junior execs in Hall 1 common room are some of the fun memories with you. Then there was this Banaras photowalk. It was really fun watching movies and going out for group dinners(specially NH91😂). We were somewhat in touch throughout the 4 years at campus. All the best for your future endeavours.🤘🏻",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a2db93819323d199d47e4c,Nupur  Mehra
5,"Yo Pinku, ab tumhare liye kya hi likhu yr. Did you ever count?  It has been 10 long years of our friendship. From being classmates to being batch mates in college, we have seen it all. Together we have enjoyed and hungout for so much time in this campus. All those night outs and dinners in canteen or restaurants (Mainly NH91😂) to visiting Z square often. Those nightouts at the events ground during fests, exploring the campus at night, hanging out in OAT and CCD 🥺 will always be missed. We have many more trips pending.  Plenty of more years to come. Tumse to milna julna laga hi rahega. ❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a15d7e819323d199d47c7a,Prakhar  Srivastava
6,"Are bhai bhai bhai... Still remember our first talk, in gym when I asked you to demonstrate triceps exercises. Tab se thodi  bahut chit chat hoti hi rahti hai. What a coincidence it was to meet you all in Goa. It felt like we are in campus and there is this fest going on😆. Bas vahan kahi ka program sath nahi ban paya🥺. But I hope we will meet sometime somewhere in future. All the best for all your ambitions. ❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a635e1819323d199d48c12,Raghav  Singh
7,"Yo Rahul, It was really nice knowing you. Didn't expect ki itna bolte hoge tum 😂. Bahut fearless ho yr tum. The capacity of your drinking  and post results make me say tum to bade heavy driver ho bhai. 😆 We really have spent some good time with you on the trip as well as back on campus. Don't take too much stress on seeing roti's stonks going up 🤭. I will miss all the fun we did together in campus. We are definitely gonna meet soon and plan for more trips together. All the best for your journey ahead ❤️.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a64759819323d199d48d6b,Rahul  Jindal
8,"Hey bro, the small talks outside labs, the discussions during the internship phase and the mass copying during the environment lab is something I remember you by. All the best for your future endeavours and hoping for some amazon vouchers in return 🤓. Lets see where we meet again.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a2c3d7819323d199d47e23,Rohan Gupta (P Kumar)
9,"Hey Shivansh, from being my Wingi who was irritating for me 😫 in first year to  landing up in same group in geotechnical course, I have seen both sides of you 😐.  But surely that group was the best among all I had been in. We did so much fun during our lab, partial credit goes to the best location we got to work in (which includes CC canteen 😜). Thank you for helping me out in my doubts and doing assignments. I wish you were here when the college reopened. We will schedule another video call soon.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a17f28819323d199d47c90,Shivansh  Tripathi
10,"Hey Chapu Roomie, it was really nice sharing a room with you. We had lots of talk and fun together. I realised that we three were destined to become roomies after we three got the same marks in CHM102A in midsems 🤓(Quite a rare thing). I will never forget the taste of your homemade mathris. I want to confess that I  used to sneek out some in your absence 😐. All the best for your future endeavours. We will meet sometime soon.",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a2b04f819323d199d47ddb,Snehan
11,"Hello Swati. Yeah, we have met few months back but it doesn't feel like that now. Trip with you all guys was the best. From playing UNO to watching movies and hanging out with you guys was awesome and I will never forget. Remember your hilarious act you did in RM when the doors were closed 😂 still makes me laugh a lot. Looking forward to hangout with you both in near future and more trips pending. 
You both together really make a good couple ❤️. All the best for your future endeavours.🤘🏻",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a63fb8819323d199d48cca,Swati  Upadhyay
12,"Yo Uttu, I hope you are doing well. Not seen you since long. It was so good to work with you, conducting Udghosh. It was really nice of you to come and attend those birthday celebrations even those were amid exams. I still remember your pole dance which you did around me (aka pole)🙄 in FMC room. The movies we watched and the dinners we had will be always remembered. We will definitely meet sometime somewhere in near future. All the best for your UPSC preperations.❤️",Saransh  Nadda,True,60a62e11819323d199d48b9e,Utkarsh  Singh
