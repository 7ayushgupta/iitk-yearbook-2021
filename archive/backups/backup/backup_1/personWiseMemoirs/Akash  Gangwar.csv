1,Hello jaydeep DS ka assignment kiya kya. It was the first  and last time I called you Jaydeep. Jaydeep became JD after that. We have come a long way from that. Remember how I used to come to your room every day and we used to gang up on Tushank on each occasion we get. Covid also couldn't stop us. Remember how we used to talk daily and discuss random thoughts and give each other funny nicknames and ganging up on Tushank never get old. Remember how we used to solve assignments together sitting in Soumya's Room. Thanks for being there in the placement session and your positive approach in life has always motivated me. You are the most optimistic person I have seen in my life and I salute you for that. Just keep it up brother you will get whatever you want in life.  Good luck for the journey ahead.,Akash  Gangwar,True,609b74df819323d199d479d5,Jaydeep  Goyal

3,"Hey Raja Babu!!!! IAS banne ke baad bhuloge to nhi na. We were wingies but sad thing is our real friendship started from the internship period but after that we have come a long way. Now we share a lot of memories together. We share our memories of Mussoorie and Nainital. Remember the Rafting, Mountain pe scooty rides and our detailed discussions about IAS vs corporate. Remember how we started GYM two times but failed to pass two weeks xD. You have always been a motivation to me and your words in Antragni like ""Vo log jo kar rhe hain vo important nhi hai tum jo kar rhe ho vo important hai"" will be a motivation for generations to come xD. You have always been a good friend to me, who was always there whenever I needed help and I thank you for that bhai. For all the years we have been friends I realized you are one of the most hardworking and helping person I have seen in my life and I truly believe you will do wonders in your years to come and Good luck with the New Journey ahead of you.

4,"Hey Bro!!! Netflix kidhar hai? Although we were wingies but I think our friendship has evolved more in last year than the three years combined. Remember our Mussoorie and Goa trip!! The fun we had. Goa was the best of them. Remember the nights at Carys and Colva besides Swimming Pool how we all opened up, I would say they were the best two of my whole trip and thanks to you for that. The Dance we had in Titos brother!!!. Remember the promise we make to Ojas apan agle saal Amsterdam chalenge bc to keep that promise. Remember the Scooty rides in Mountain, Rafting hmm same boat me the. Agar main apne trips ki photo ko PC dene baithu to 90% credits tereko jaaega. So, Bro, you are one of the good friends I had in IITK.....Life me bhulna nhi... Remain in touch Brother.",Akash  Gangwar,True,60a5947c819323d199d48722,Rushikesh  Najan
5,"It all started with Robocon in 3rd Semester. Time is the proof of how good friends we became in the last 5 semesters. We share a lot of memories in campus together. Let's start with the funniest one in the EE381 class remember how prof said ""vo dono jo last seat pe baithe hain un dono ko matlab hi nhi hai class me kya chal rha kuch"" and we didn't gave a damn even after hearing him. Remember how we used to find excuses and parties of random shits to go to CCD and hall 12 canteen. Remember the Manual PID which was most non-technical thing we can came up with but good thing it worked. Remember the placement session how fast we were in sharing the links. Now, Thanks to you for bearing with me and another thanks to you for helping me pass in the online semesters warna kya pata ek F aa jaata. For all the time we spent together I came to realize you are one of the most hard working and honest person I have seen in my entire life and I salute you for that. You are also one of funniest to hang out with tabhi to itne acche dost ban gye. In the end I just want to say Keep it up bro these are your strengths and I truly believe you will do wonders in life and another thing bhul mat jana bro.

Pata nhi kaise vo project ho gya and it went good in the end, hum to bas baate karne aate the wahan pe. Remember our trip to Ganga Barrage and that scooty guy aaj hansi aa rhi but if we look back then we were scared to death at that time. After that it was always fun meeting you in library. Library to tumhara ghar ban gya tha hmesha wahi milte the. You are a very down to earth guy even after possessing such intelligence and dedication. Keep it up brother you will do wonders in life.....

7,"Hey Scooty Partner!!! Remeber the Mussoorie and Nanital scooty rides other people exchanged their partners we were constant for both tripes. Remember that turn on Neelkhand when bus suddenly popped in front. Abhi to hans sakte but we both agree we both were scared to death at the instant. Then also I trusted you more than anyone it the lot. Remember our jogging sessions although they couldn't last for more than 10 days in both instants. Remember our discussions on the HOW TO BECOME AN IAS?. I still remember your one line ""Hmara group poora 2 saal baad IAS me milega"". It gives me a huge motivation I just want to say for all the time we have known each other you were one of the most hardworking and dedicated person I have seen in my life and Keep it up bro you will do wonders in life.

9,"Hey Bro!!!! How are you? We share a lot of memories together but we both agree the best one was three people sitting in front of Mama Mio in Antragni bas itna kaphi hai yaad aa gya hoga ab tk to. Uske baad kya tha Covid ho gya tha and we got little chance to share more funny memories on campus but thanks to messenger we had good run during the placement session. Remember how three non PPO guys used to come together and apna RR karte the and used to come up with funny nick names of each others. Thanks for being a huge motivation for me and your words like ""Kya bhai ignore kar rhi thi phir socha placement hai dhayan de lo jitna vo ek saal me kamati hai utna main ek mahine me kamaunga"" will be a huge motivations for generations to come xD. There are so many funny memories and list is big but can't share them all so in the end I will say then for the time I have known you are one of the most hardworking and dedicated person I have seen in my life and Keep it up bro and jab hedge fund khol lo to bhul mat jana bro xD",Akash  Gangwar,True,609299a8819323d199d47775,Tushank  Gupta
