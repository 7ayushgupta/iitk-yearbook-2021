0,"1. Hi Betty,
Let's start with Google :P
Though we were only two seats away, it took us two semesters to finally cross paths (condition, both of us being aware, C-Mid out of reach :P). Oh, I wish now I should have been more courageous, bas 2 kadam hi to chalna tha. Life me probably har cheez end me ki, har kaam me late hua, but oh I swear, agar kismat-e-khuda fir mauke ne dastak di, is baar time pe a jaunga, is baar nahi aalas karunga. 

Kya me ye kehke flirt kar sakta hu, ki ""T.T. to bas ek bahana tha, apse milne ka irada tha :P"", theeke, might not work, but tujhse bura T.T. shayad hi koi khelta tha. But ngl, that summer camp changed my campus life a big swing, not to forget orientation lol, bacho ki ragging nahi leni ati tujhe. 
Post that, mostly hi hello aur apke thermo ke quiz mere dwara likhe jane tak, itna hi interaction ho gaya tha mostly. But, Diwali's have always been eventful for us, haina ;). From that to numerous trip plans, cancellation, boredom, Naman ke maze lena, late-night random texts, time flew. But I am glad we went to Offline on the Roof that day; that broke the ice (both literally and metaphorically), didn't it. 

I still can't believe I ignored you for a complete sem :P, I am still ashamed for that. But, now that I remember, that led us to our first time alone in C.C.D., with me being caught by the very prof I bunked class of X.D. Sorry for the messed up intern call, I wish I could go back, need to make few blocks fall in place. But, post that, the reunion was bound to happen with me in my worst state, at the best possible location, for the worst possible topic (oh, we know what moment are we talking off, I'll save myself the embarrassment of making it public here). They say everything happens for a purpose, I might now have figured it back then (yes, I am slow, especially in your case, remember hall 12 se 6 takes me 30 mins :P), but now that I look back at that moment, I indeed find my best friend bearing me at my worst (again, metaphorically and literally :P).

From that to Hall 4 wala gyan, to ""duniya hi badal do me to pyara sa chamatkar hu"", and then to that unplanned Antaragni night, I think our lives finally started to obey the laws of thermo. What a living manifestation of the butterfly effect that event was. Not every day I miss flights, not every day we bilk 3k worth of drinks :P. So these events officially mark your presence in 2/3 impactful events of my college life. Needless to say, you have always been this special, right :P. Sorry for messing up your birthday really bad. I was never good with birthdays :(. Next time pakka better.
 

Spring brought about spring in our lives too, haina? Chalo firse waise hi rehte h? Probably the best time we had, things sailing like the titanic, but little did we knew that CoVID ka iceberg was closer than it appeared. I am so glad we went to Manali, agar wo kat gaya hota to kise hi pata tha age ka. And I regret missing that opportunity, and then our ""8 Jan"" happened X.D. I still regret not running behind your cab at hotel samrat :(. 

Post that, to numerous cheeze hui. I messed up big (read every) time; kudos to my bad social (read virtually social) skills. But I can't really justify on text how supportive you were. Love you 3000 for that. We saw through every thick and thin, so much so that now we might as well qualify as living proof of the 3rd law of thermodynamics ;). The entropy of our system decreased, and for good :)

Sorry for Goa, but my first visit to Jaipur involved my two best friends couldn't have been better. I wanted to come back sahi me that day, but you knew my halat. Though, 8 Jan will always be special. And then that tiny but beautiful period on the campus. Literally everything falling apart in terms of rules at campus, kuch cheeze reh gai, bahot moments choot gaye, but it was soooooo gooooooood till it lasted. I promise I am the same milestone, just that it needs some polishing. I will be the same :)

Songs have always been special to us. (we didn't choose our yet, the onus on you now) 
But, so quickly life went from ""There for You"" ---> ""Perfect"" ---> ""The Middle"" ---> ""Stay"". Let's take it to ""Love Story"" now? :P 

This marks the end of this long pending memoir, but mark my words if nothing else. We still have lots of time, my list of movies, sorry cards and education to catch up on, hopefully (like really) together <3

P.S. I know I am late again..., nth time after the deadline, but I kept my promise, I managed to get things in place. Hopefully, this is the last time I'll use this superpower :P. Also, that ""1"" has significance X.D.

P.P.S. Here's the answer to some recent question/s posed to me: 
From ""Back to You"" Lyrics: 2nd para first two lines + 3rd para last four lines.
