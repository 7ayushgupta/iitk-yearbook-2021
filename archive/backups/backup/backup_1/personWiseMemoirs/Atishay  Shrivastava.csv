Was a lot of fun knowing you.
Hope we meet again.

1,"The first girl I met in IITK, I didn't know that I'll find my that someone as your roomie.
Sorry for the prank we pulled in the first year😅
You are a girl that can command an army😂
Mujhe teri maar yaad hai😂, tera mere peeche bottle le kar bhagna yaad hai.
Hope we get a chance to meet again and create some more memories.
Stay happy in your life always.

2,"We stood by together throughout our stay on campus. We met in PHY lab from then till date you are covering for me😅. Most times I was careless about any type of submission but you helped me.
Our night out for study or just for a bulla session also your AAA trilogy will always be remembered. I have not seen Star Wars yet but will surely do it😂.
Looking forward to a trip with you, missed you in the last one.
Hope the campus opens soon and we meet again. 
Stay Happy Stay Safe.

4,"Bhai teri wajay se hi meri chemical ki degree ho pai hai, thanks to you and your notes, assignment, quiz, and all other things. Will remember the time you taught us just before the exam, the time we played pubg together. 
I also remember conveying messages between two individuals😉.
 Thanks though for all the help and I will always cherish our friendship.

5,"Mera Udghosh ke design ka bhar uthane ke liye dhanyawad pata nahi mai kaise karta. Mai to first year se chah raha tha koi jija la de tu lekin tum to chuperustam nikle...😜 
Also tujhe 14 bol bol chidhana, dono haatho se hi karna yaad rahega mujhe🤣.

6,"As I remember I met you at L-20, during counselling session. Remembering your name was a tough one for me then and spelling it was even tougher😅.
Though we did not meet much after that I wish we could meet again in the very same way.

7,"You are that kind of friend jisse milke ek ek gaali to dena jaroori hai😂
We met in summer of first year and how we passed that course was hilarious, assignment deadline ke baad door ke neeche se dal dena and all.
The pubg is another thing for us, from start you were always a part of my team but almost never available due to your issues😂
Hope we meet again on campus soon and have much more fun.

8,"Tikki nahi nahi, Mikasa are nahi, Senku oh shit, Rahul haan mai tujhse Swati ke through mila tha first time I think library me tab to mujhe tu bahut padhaku lagta tha fir jab tujhe jana tab pata laga meri tarah tu bhi bas jaise taise course nikal raha haj😂.
Tu hai to punjabi par jab bolta hai tabhi feel aati hai tere punjabi hone ki.
Ghanto ghanto tak canteen me baith ke ludo khela karte the apan aur double special chai😍
Bhand hone ke baad to tu alag hi ho jata hai na jane kaha se itti bhook aur pyas lagti hai tujhe, itta sa pet hai rehem kar liya kar.
Tu patte acche khelta hai pubg bhi theek thak khel leta hai, ludo me to bot hi hai tu, 6 master😂
The group of us 3 was the best.
I hope we meet again soon.
Lead a happy life and stay safe😁

9,"Bhai tujhe pehchanta to first year se hi hu lekin tujhe jaana maine lockdown ke baad hi hai.
Tere jane se pehle wala din hamesha yaad rahega. Khudka haath tod ke agle din puchta hai kisne kiya😂.
Tu na bahut kam bolta hai😛, but you were the one to keep us entertained with nonstop nonsense 😂.
Hope we meet again.

10,"Though I should not be saying it but I gotta tell someone named you chanda mama😅.
Will always remember our trip together, our last minute plans for the next day, also only we two could drive so it sometimes felt like we were taking our kids for a ride😂.
Every time something unexpected happened we waited for you to drop 😨 to drop this emote.
You two are the best duo I know on campus and be the one.
Wish we had more time to get to know each other better but we will surely meet in future.

11,"Wish we met sooner cause you both are the rare kind who has the same vibe like us😁, we get along well.
Seeing you two together makes me happy, and I wish that bond lasts forever.

12,"Whatever I say about you would be less, in any form of words I'm unable to express what you are to me. I'm very very happy that I met you, I do remember Ladha was the one who introduced me to you for our psychology project which we barely made😂
Humne fir uske baad na jane kitti masti kari hai, first year was like no f* given to studies all time just playing games watching series in class also bunking the class😛. ESO101 ke kand ke baad  meri wajay PHY thukwa lena🤣.
All that time ran by so fast, but I’m happy to spend most of it with you.
Out of all the stupidity in which we have been together my personal favourite memory is jab pole beech me aa gaya tha and how can I forget cycle pe ulta bitha ke ghumana. I always love teasing you but I don't like you teasing me😅.
Playing cards, pubg and also apna bhand ho jana are the memories of college we will never forget.
Mujhe bahut hi kam yaad hai tumhe Swati naam se bulaya ho I always call you with some cute names (bhains to khud tumne hi rakh liya tha)😂. You are the rarest kind of person that can make fun of anyone including self.
We have been through ups and downs and that has made our bond even stronger. I learned a lot from you, and will continue doing so.

14,"Aa ja ek round chess ka khelte hai.
Tere tash wala game to abhi tak samajhne ki koshish kar raha hu, har baar naye rules 😂
