0,"Thank God I met you and that too in the first year !! Do you even know how much I relate to you and how easy it is to be my original self around you. Thanks for being the person who always makes me feel at home <3. Remember the elaborate discussions we had at OAT and do you still remember the club we formed (let it remain a secret though)? Going to literally every fest together, going for most of the quizzes, lectures and labs together and definitely going to canteens together. Ye sab moments were enough to cheer me up for the day. I miss those days so much.
We shared so so many moments together and I love each one of them jaise ki our canteen visits and our shared love for Special fry masala maggi and cold coffee. Har lecture se pehle tumhara mere liye wait krna, yaa lecture hall m always saving a seat for me  yaa cycle bhaga kar lecture hall se mess pahuchna so that breakfast naa miss ho jaaye, saath m movies dekhna after exams, enjoying so many fests together or simply just chilling in your room and what not !! Thanks a lot for being the person I could always hangout with ! Stay the really hard-working, awesome, caring and helpful person that you are !
P.S. Bahut photos bhej di tumne acche khaane ki, jald hi milte hai and and treat me with the tasty cakes and food you make. 
Lots of love !!
Sunamya.

1,"Aur, kaise ho ?
I still remember the first time I met you. Do you ?
Definitely the most chilled out person who can handle every situation so beautifully. Though we met quite late, but still I feel lucky that I know a person like you. The way you care for your friends and practically every person who needs help, your kind nature, attitude of never giving up, managing so many things at the same time, all add up to make the Ashish that I know today. Remember how we used to do the simulation assignments at NCL just before the deadline and still take out some time to go for lunch together xD. Watching movies, standups, and even studying the night before exams was all so fun because of you !
Remember how you used to ask me to teach you but ultimately you ended up teaching me stuff  - that’s the height of your chapuness.
I really admire the smile on your face and the spark in your eyes whenever you talk about Prayas and how much you love the kids there. 
Thanks for being the kind-hearted, super helpful, selfless and positive person that you are. Always stay the same - happy, hard working, chilled out and haa keep making more and more cool animations !!
Be my host forever (and chacha to the others...lol).
Stay in touch.

Lots of love, 
Sunamya

2,"“Jee”shaan,

I am so so glad that we met and for that the credit definitely goes to Vishal sir. The only good thing that came out of that simulation course was that I gained some really good friends (you included obviously). From having the impression that you’re quite a serious and studious person, to actually knowing what an incredibly fascinating and fun loving (who loves pulling pranks) and hard working and strong-willed human being you really are, we have definitely come a long way. All those long walks, canteen trips, extensive discussions where you were the one doing most of the talking (and I was happy listening) and many more such memories that I can’t possibly list down here, will all always be cherished. 
Well, your PJs, academic rona dhona, messed up logics and a dozen more cringe things that you (and I both) fail to recall, definitely struck a chord in my symphony and so you better do that all over again. Glad we have one more year for that !
P.S. You are one of the ‘sabse sahi’ people I’ve ever met.
P.P.S. I still won’t forgive you for pulling that prank on me (hmmph).

We’ll definitely keep in touch (read as - we'll keep irritating each other) Zee !

Lots of love,
Sunamya.
