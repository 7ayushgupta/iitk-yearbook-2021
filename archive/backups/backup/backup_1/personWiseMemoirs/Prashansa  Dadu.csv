As I sit down to write this...I don’t even know where to begin. There is so much that I am grateful for and so many things to be proud of! You are the coolest and the warmest person I have ever met and as I write this, tears come rolling down my eyes :’) I can’t be grateful enough to have met you and the way tables have turned around between us!  You are the first person I share everything with whenever anything happens, doesn’t matter if it’s connected to you or not! (I can’t believe I just confessed this) You amaze me every time! Thank youuu sooo muchhh for making my life no less than a fairy tale. Whatever be the situation (good or bad), we have always managed to turn it into a golden memory, to be cherished forever!

Thank you for helping me become a better person (in progress though ;P), come out of my comfort zone, try new things, make new friends and the list goes on and on and on! You are the most amazingest (;P) person I have everrrrr met.

IITK will always hold a special place in my heart for it has been a great host and helped me meet you in the most uncertain of times. You have been with me through thick and thin and I expect this to continue in the coming years! Thank you for tolerating me!!

Call me as soon as you read this, or, you know the consequences! Also, don’t ever forget to be proud of yourself as the ‘almighty’ Prashansa Dadu loves you <3 !! Cheers to all the mad things we did together! Let’s meet as soon as the pandemic is over. Until then, no byes!",Prashansa  Dadu,True,608d3244819323d199d47634,Jayesh  Narwaria

Okayy, let me think where to start....Honestly, I won’t even miss you, because I don’t feel like we have separated, as you know we ARE GONNNA LIVE TOGETHERR!!! But yess, I will miss those irritating bangs on my door when I wished to throw you down from the window, and then realising she is a nice person and fine, I'll let her go XD. If anyone would have told me in my first year that Maitreyee Srivastava would be my friend someday, I swear, I would not have believed that. But look, where we are now!

Looking forward to live with youuuu motiii.... As soon as i meet you...I gonna land on youu...remember that!!!! Bohot saari reels and bohot saari photoshoots krne hain apan ko!
