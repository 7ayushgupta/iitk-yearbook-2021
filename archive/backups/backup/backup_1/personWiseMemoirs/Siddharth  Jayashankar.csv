Thank you for the perfect love-hate relationship.

I know things went off track between us but I’m really glad that everything’s even better now than it ever was.

All the best for life ahead. May you get all the money you want to buy all the Zara you want ( and also get the fig to fit into them ).

I’ll miss you a ton.

PS: You still owe me for all the Nescafé.
PPS: & FFS buy glasses that actually fit you…

Lots n’ lots of love <3 (jk)

1,"I remember we ended up sitting next to each other in the orientation, and that’s when we first spoke. Though I didn’t remember your name, I just remembered your face. Never saw you for the whole first year after that day tho… :(. We’ve bumped into each other once in a while ever since you started showing up more in the Academic Area and Hall 2.

Anyway, I’ll always remember this time in Antaragni when you were high AF, and you started talking to me. It was a bit awkward :p, I must say. Also, I’m glad I could be of help in TA201.

Best of luck!

2,"I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone as cool as you, smarty. I love how you’re so chill with everything (I so need to learn that from you). 

I remember the first time I met you and I was like “I’ve seen you in the newspaper”. 

You’re a talent value pack - super smarts (literal god), dancing, poetry, entertainment, what can’t you do?

The world needs you on the silver screen. You can leave the boring CS stuff to people like me.

I'm so glad we’re family.

Lots of love

3,"For some reason, I thought you were in CSE the first time I met you. Anyway, you wound up being a member of the department unofficially so I sorta was correct.

I’ll always remember our late night chai sessions, and your go-to words - “bachpan se” and also ”Snehal, gajar kha”. Also, I’m amazed by how much work you do and how many fuckin’ credits you take in a semester.

My architecture bud - from discussions on CS220 & OS to Intel to “valgrinding” & “ADBing” through two semesters, and also your on-off relationship with you know who.

I hate you for putting the breaks on all my crazy ideas but somehow I guess that’s needed so I come around.

Good luck for GATech!
Make me proud!
Love

4,"I still remember the first time we met was at my party and you were supposed to prank me or something but I don’t really remember what happened that day so… 😛.

We did become good friends after that. Plus all that time in German Class was so much fun with you. I was kinda sad whenever you never showed up to class 🙁. Also that skit rehearsal.

Thanks for all the discussions in CCD whenever we bumped into each other. You’re one of the sweetest people I’ve met at IITK.

All the best for everything in life!

Love

5,"I don’t think there’s anyone on this planet with your focus, dedication, intelligence and INSANE ABILITY TO SIT ON A CHAIR AND NEVER, EVER GET UP.

How many times have I come running to you with “Keeeessshaaaaav, how do you this???”  You’re literally my (and the entire CSE department’s ) 24x7 helpline. I swear to god, I don’t know where I would be if I didn’t know you. 

From that MTH101 office hour to lecture halls, the library and finally the holy grail - KD, you’ve been an invariant in my journey.

Anyway, kill it wherever you go. And we’ve got to see a match, so make a lot of money and sponsor my tickets also.

Lots of love <3
Don’t ever forget me

6,"Okay, where do I even begin this??? I don’t think I can ever fit all our memories here… but I’ll try.  You’ve been the constant that’s been there with me from my very first day at IITK to the last day. DebSoc, Vox, Inter IIT, RM/KD, CCD etc…

Thank you (not) for dragging me to so many stupid events with you in the first year. 

I was always amazed by you trying to be this wonder kid when you used to watch ML lectures in the first year. Anyway, we know how that ended up.

All the stupid overnight debates we’ve had in Hall2, all the trips to Mocha and that afternoon at Hard Rock Café. I’ll never forget those. And also all your bitching about MTH to PClub to DebSoc to Vox. I’ve been there to listen to it all. And also our mutual dislike for certain people ;)

Also please let her (you know who) know what’s in your heart someday.

Kill it at Stanford. I’ll miss you super duper.

Love love love you fam <3

7,"Yo Topper! This is way too hard for me to write but here’s an attempt...

One of my lifelines at IITK right from the first semester. We’re similar in so many ways. Both clueless, lost and trying to find our way around. You’re the nicest, sweetest and most genuine person I’ve met at this place. I’m so glad I met you.

Still, remember your idiotic smile after topping the ECO101 end sem.

How many times have we cribbed and cried about everything under the sun - internships, projects, assignments, courses, quizzes, mid-semester exams, placements, research, end-semester exams and the mere possibility of the dreaded B grade which eventually did end up coming?

I've survived so much only because of you. You've lifted me up in my lowest moments. You’ve played a big role in what I am today. I’m eternally grateful to you for everything you’ve ever done.

I’m sorry for that email incident in COM. And I’m still mad at you for ditching me for Vasundhara after agreeing to be my partner in 203.

And that lizard which scared Yatin and you out of your room. LOL!!

K, there’s so much to write about you over four years but I guess I’m going to stop here for now.

You’re waaayy stronger than you think you are.
God Bless You!

See you at Microsoft!

Love love love you <3

8,"Can still hear Anish saying “Snehal, gajar kha”.

“God of Machine Learning and Quantum Physics”

One more of my KD buddies + Hall 2. Hope you remember our war on sugar in the mess. I still follow it BTW.

Also, your 3D graphics game was super weird but fun to play. And remember that model of RM101?? And I never could understand how you managed to read that tiny font on your screen.

And that TA202 project - remember that afternoon in the CC making CAD models? We won the best project only coz you were the expert on the lathe machine.

All the OS quizzes and that ML assignment (esp the overleaf account). I’m so glad I know you. Keep in touch “god”.

Oxford is lucky that you selected them.

Lots of love
