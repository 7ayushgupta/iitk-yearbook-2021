Bas ek hi cheez thi dimaag mein ki kab ye khatam ho aur kab apan party kare. 
Wo MUN jaisa bhi hua, but hum logo ne bohot maze kiye. Aaj bhi wo raat yaad hai jab finally MUN khatam hua tha aur hum teeno ne kya mast daaru pi thi. <3 
Jaate jaate mil nahi paaye, lekin mumbai mein ek din saath baith ke fir daaru piyenge aur Sana Kritika ke aage ke kisse bataienge. <3
Thanks for being a part of the journey <3",Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta),True,60a6706f819323d199d48ff7,Aditya  Gupta
1,"First year mein jab pehli baar dekha tha toh laga ye kya dekh lia :P
Pujari aur Paapi ka combo shayad akela hoga poore college mein.
Lekin tu nahi hota toh college mein 'FUN' wala element mein kabhi experience hi nahi kar paata shayad. 
3rd Year tak aate aate agarbaatiyon ki jagah maal ne leli thi, lekin isko try karane ka shrey mein hi leleta hu. 
Lekin honestly you have been a crucial part of my college journey.

2,"Bhai <3
Nationals mein apni bonding kaafi strong hogayi thi, wo lucknow trip mein kya mast cocktails try ki thi. 
Saath mein daaru pine aur bhawan ki maa chodne ka alag hi feel tha. Thanks for helping out in mse courses.
Jaldi milte hai fir aur daaru and bakchodi kaatenge <3",Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta),True,60a671ef819323d199d49007,Anant  Jain
3,"So here is the one from your KAJUU xD
I guess hum pehli baar CCD mein mile the jab Anany ne treat di thi, tab laga tha iske saath friendship karne mein kaafi efforts daalne padenge.  Fir second year mein jaise jaise communication badhta gaya, apni bonding aur strong hoti gayi. Hall 2 ke hostel room ki bakchodi, zomato se order karke khaane pe ladna ho ya room mein random weed and daaru party karna ho, you became the part of everything. Not even a single time you made me feel like a third wheeler :P Apni Goa was one of the best trips I've been to, just the right people at the right place. ""TERE BHAI NE AAJ TAK ULTI NAHI KI"" waali raat kabhi nahi bhoolunga xD. You take a very special place in my college journey, which I never expected. Noida mein 5 din pata hi nahi chale kab nikal gaye tere saath but it was such a fun time being together after so long. This is a bond for LIFETIME and we will be meeting very soon. <3
Oye, jaldi se Singapore ka plan karle,it is next in list. :P",Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta),True,60a380b3819323d199d47eb4,Gunjan  Jalori
4,"Well, this is one of the hardest memoirs for me to write. I have infinite memories and limited space to sum it all up. Jab orientation mein pata laga tha ki teri AIR 10 hai, I used to brag about it everywhere like ""YE MERA BHAI HAI"", and within the 4 years ye mere liye literal hogaya hai. I guess you are the only person who can summarise my college life to anyone because you have been the third eye of me during my college stay.
JItna time hum dono ek saath spend kiya hai college mein, I can bet that no other friends or couple would have done the same. You are the most Simple, Humble, Raw, Helpful and the CHAAPU-est guy I've ever met. If someone would ask me what does chaapu in IITK means? ""Anany Sharma"" will be the answer for it. Its not been a single time that you have let me down and we share the purest form of friendship. Tere raat ke 2 baje BSBE mein hagne ke sessions ho ya becch beech mein dieting ka bhoot savaar hona, I always tried to make fun out of those moments.College mein jitni bakchodi ki hai sab saath hai, chahe wo raat ke 12 baje sudden movie plans ho ya goa, mussoorie, shimla jaisi trips. We have been always together throughout all the ups and downs during the journey, and I cannot imagine my college life without you. Even if i think of it, there is a huge void which can never be filled by anyone else. College toh khatam ho chuka hai lekin apni dosti kabhi khatam nahi hogi, jaldi hi ek aur trip pe waapas se milenge. 
Jaate Jaate ek sher farmana chaahunga-
तेरे हर एक दर्द का एहसास है मुझे,
तेरी मेरी दोस्ती पर बहुत नाज़ है मुझे,
क़यामत तक न बिछड़ेंगे हम दो दोस्त,
कल से भी ज्यादा भरोसा आज है मुझे।

5,"To my first best friend I met in college. <3
 I remember that we had a large group in the first year, but dheere dheere it fragmented out into pieces, but you were the only one who stayed till the last day. We share the purest form of friendship and a bond that can never be broken. To all those MSE lectures, chai breaks, library sessions during the exams, ya kisi ki birthday party, we cherish all those moments together. Whenever I felt low or was going through a tough phase, it was just you and anany with whom I shared my feelings. Thanks for always being there <3 Saath mein bhand hone se lekar catan ke game tak, it was such a blessing for me to have you as part of my IITK journey.
Take care! And haan jaldi se fir milenge <3",Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta),True,60a638e4819323d199d48c46,Ananya  Goswami
6,"Bhai <3, the only thing which makes me sad is that you were being missed while I was rolling blunts or throwing out a gravity party. Either be it the library sessions during the exams or our MSE group walks,  it was such a wonderful feeling to cherish those moments together. You are one of those few multi-talented guys back in college who are quite popular among all the batches and definitely a chick magnet :P. I miss all those drinking sessions and the new year's eve party. 
Let's meet super soon, and smoke some pot together, not giving a fuck about the world. <3

7,"Bhai hall 12 mein aana hota tha toh ye niyam tha ki tere se bina mile nahi jaana hai. Tujhse bakchod aur genuine insaan nahi dekha, to all the daaru parties, ramiah pe bakchodi ya nainital waali trip, we owe memories together. <3 Jitna dedication tujhe Techkriti ke liye tha shayad utna dedication maine kisi mein kisi cheez ke liye nahi dekha hoga.  Thanks for being a part of my IITK journey, and jaldi se mil bohot time hogaya nashe kare hue xD",Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta),True,60a6336c819323d199d48bef,Aviral  Khare
8,"""SIR""
ye shabd,shabd nahi ek honour hai jisko aap sachme deserve karte ho, dil se respect hai aapke lie.
Aapke saath jitni bakchodi ki hai wo kam hai, chahe wo mere room pe maal fukna ho ya saare laundo ke saath bhimti talks. xD C-BOT B-BOT ka ek alag hi rishta tha, laundo ke room pe bomb phodne se lekar prank calls tak, we owe memories together. To all the bhand nights, and last ke 2 months ke liye toh shabd kam padh jayenge lekin yaadien nahi. Jo mehfil roz sajti thi usse aaj tak nahi bhula paaya hu, aur hume toh pehle se hi pata tha ki aapka IIMA convert hona hi tha, isiliye advance mein hi party le li thi :P
Ab jaldi se milne ka plan banao, jisse wo di waapas ji paayien. <3

9,"""Aaja bhai fookne"",""chal photoshoot karna hai"". On the first impression mujhe laga tha tu kaafi arrogant hoga,  but jaise jaise humne vibe kia, I really got to know that you are one of the nicest guy I've met in college. Fir wo chahe saath mein bulla sessions ho ya maal pe vibe karna, you were truly a vibe setter.

College mein tehzeeb se galiyana bas tumhe hi aata hai :P
Mere room pr saath mein daaru pe baatien ho ya Hall 12 mein bakchodi, har jagah tum hi se mehfil banti thi.
Nainital trip pe bhi kya maze kiye the, abhi tak yaad hai.
Jaldi se ye corona khatam ho toh Agra aao, khaatirdari karenge tumhari.
It was fun cherishing all the moments together with you <3
Hope to meet you again soon!

11,"Writing this memoir won't do justice to the memories and the time I've spent with you back at campus.
You are the most genuine, hardworking, rational and intellectual guy I've met in IIT Kanpur. Whether to the meaningless debates at my room or the one we had in the OAT( sutta ya baccha xD), I really cherish all those moments spent together. Kahin bhi daaru ka plan bane toh I made it sure that you have to be included because you completed the vibe. <3 Cheers to some of the epic trips we went together.
Hindu ka debating experience was something which I will never forget, and if you ever feel like getting one of the most relaxing experience in the world, you know the place xD Maine jitne bhi daring experiences try kiye college mein you were the part of them too xD I miss all those late night walks jab hum saare bhai CCD OAT jaate the and used to discuss random shit. Even after having so many involvements, you made it sure to join us for the party ya kabhi bhi jab hum bahar dinner karne jaate the. Wo movie night and rickshaw ka incident was one the most epic thing and that is how the name ""Budhau"" originated :P (though on the same night accident bhi hua tha and you know the rest ...)
Seeing you getting accepted by Stanford was genuinely a proud moment for me, I was so happy for you. Maine toh anany se bet bhi lagayi hai ki tu pakka firangi se hi shaadi karega :P 
WE OWE BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES TOGETHER <3
Goodluck for future and hum sab firse jaldi milenge for sure.",Abhishek Gupta (N K Gupta),True,60a6319e819323d199d48bd4,Kushagra  Gupta
12,"Aur Jaaneman <3
Hall se aana ho ya jaana, tere room pe dastak dete hue hi safar poora hota tha. Ab chahe saath mein maal phookna ho ya tujhe galiyana(aisehi ann kar raha tha :P), uska bhi alag hi charm tha jo bas hum dono hi share karte the. Library mein saath padhne se lekar myntra pe saath shopping karne tak, we owe memories together. Abhi toh bangalore chapter baaki hai, yahan dono ko game strong karna hai.
Jaldi milte hai, fir tinder pe swipe bhi toh karna hai :P

13,"I don't know where to start from, well we met for the first time in the library where I was supposed to teach you MTH-101, but somehow you ended up teaching me :P Later managed a movie together(i don't remember which one it was xD).  Next, it was PHY-103, where I mugged up the lessons 10 minutes before teaching you the same :D Lmao, but it ended up in a conversation over a coffee in CCD.
Blue World was fun until Nunnu ruined it all. We have memories to share but mostly in the 1st half of the journey, I hope we keep in touch even after college. It was lovely to cherish those moments together.<3

Antaragni ki bakchodi aur random drinking sessions humesha yaad rahenge. ""Chal bhai trip plan karte hai"" (iss baar seriously bohot time hogaya hai) :P.

Orientation ke time gaali sunke chaddar mein rote dekh, mujhe khudki choice pe doubt hogaya tha ki mein sahi jagah hu ki nahi. Lekin tumne with time kaafi progress ki hai, aur aaj dhadake se kisi ko bhi galiya dete ho. GOOD BETA. You are the most helpful guy I've met in IIT KANPUR.
Tumhare har jagah news channel banne ka outcome hai ki aaj hum nostalgic feel kar paate hai saari videos dekh ke. Bhai tere se zyada oriented aur saaf room kisi ladke ka nahi dekha maine college mein. 
Harkate toh tumhari bhi kam nahi thi waise, wo chutiyon ki tarah raat ko lawn mein baith ke thitoornna, back ache ka naatak karke nurse ko dekhne ka bahana.
Chalo pizza order karte hai :P
