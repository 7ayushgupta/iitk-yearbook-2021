0,"Hey bro, It's been a long time since I've known you and one thing I can say for sure is that we started off as brothers and we will go off as brothers. You were always the guy I used to get positive motivation from. Very active, sporty, always optimistic, always on time and always planning ahead is how I would describe you. You were always so punctual, that I used used to rely on you more than my alarm (remember all my wake-up texts on the night before each exam 😂). From our random bulla sessions to our OS assignment hangouts to my last day photoshoot, all moments go into my memory-bag. I still remember the night when your laptop erased a full-day worth of OS code you had written and you still had the determination to write all of that again 😳!! We planned to hit the gym together so many times, but it never happened 😥. I still hope that you go to the gym with me someday in the future or maybe at least teach me your basketball tactics 😛. I wish you all the best for all your future endeavors, and no doubt you will succeed in whichever avenue you proceed. Hope to meet you soon!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a71189819323d199d491de,Ayush Hitesh Soneria
1,"Bhai, kaafi special friend hai tu IITK ka. Har samay saath raha tu, sukh dukh and har stressful season mein, and not to mention, last month to kaafi special raha tere saath, bas ek chiz adhoora reh gaya, tere saath high nahi hua 😔. Kaafi change ho gaya hai tu 4 saalon mein (except your beard jo abhi tak nahi aayi 😛). Mujhe yaad bhi nahi kaise mulaqaat hui hamari, bas itna yaad 1 sem ke baad hi hum sab bhai ho gaye the. Canteen ka chikken tikka masala tune hi bataya tha mujhe sabse pehle. Tu shayad mujhe chaapu samajhta hoga, par jitna tujhe lagta utna hun nahi mai, bas kisi tarah saare courses paar hui hai mujhse. In fact main to bilkul book choota tak nahi hun. Tu kaafi hard working and determined rehta hai hamesha, and ek baar jis par focus karta use achche se finish karta. Par tu sab chiz ke saath kaafi humble bhi hai. Mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai, humne 2 non-veg pizzas mangaye the, and usne galti se ek veg de diya tha but tune wo wala le liya. Tune kaafi chizon mein meri tips liye, but mujhe kabhi apne relationship tips nahi diye 😔. Also thanks ECO764 mein mere assignments and presentation karne ke liye. Chalo, all the best for your job (thora workout kar lena Bangalore jane ke pehle 😛), hope you succeed in all avenues you pursue. Fingers crossed to meet you again!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a8344a819323d199d4937f,Deepesh Kumar Lall
2,"Munmun, Haga, Harshaga, no matter what we call you, you'll always be the bubbly, cheerful, smiling guy I know. From dancing to searching research internships (remember going to senior dorms late night fishing for advice 😅), preparing for interviews (which I screwed up sadly 😪), collaborating in assignments and quizzes, NLP project, CS610 (we set a new benchmark for collaboration and bitching together 😛) and the Goa Trip, we have been together through all these times. We first met in the dancing group where I quickly became the notorious fraudy, and you were the only one who gave me hope that maybe I wasn't the worst dancer (sorry lol 😛). You were my goto person for personal advice, CS talk, random gossip, asking treats (none of which you ever gave 😔) and for help. Being an introvert, you were the much needed friend to pull me out of my bubble and help me meet other smart people (including you). How would I have ever learnt how to fake smile and click good photos if you weren't there as my mentor 😛. You are the most honest and open friend I've had. I can literally talk to you about anything without thinking twice, because I know we are bros. Thank you for making my IITK life a hundred times happier, worthful and easier 😌. God knows what hole of depression I'd have been in had I not found you. I hope no matter how far away you are, do not forget what this emoji means 👬, ""Bhai hai tu mera.."". Also, good luck in finding Korean women and do bring back Samsung Watches for me. Hope to see you soon!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a83462819323d199d49380,Harsh  Agarwal
3,"I had always heard of you as the great chaapu of our batch, but only got to see it in our NLP project that you were much more than that. A bit quiet but very humble, easygoing, funny and smart we had so many fun (and a bit stressful 😛) nights in the KD. Don't know how we would have pulled off that project without you. I wish I had got more nights to spend in the KD but lockdown did us all. The Goa trip was our special memory, I will always remember the vegan food and all those ice-creams you had over there lol 😂, and the orange candy that you never shared with us 😛. Hope you forgive me for getting us late and then leaving you stranded at the airport 😰, I so dearly wish I could have stayed there and fought with that air hostess 😔, I spent the remainder of my flight thinking of all kinds of arguments I could have given to get you on board. I wish I learn some good investing strategies from you and maybe convert those Dogecoin losses into something useful 😬. Best of luck in all your future endeavors, hope to see you soon!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a7128f819323d199d491df,Keshav  Bansal
4,"Quantum God, food lover, pro dancer and -1/12 (abhi tak nahi pata iska kya matlab 😔). Dancing and GameAThon are the most distinctive intial memories of you. Uske baad se poora hi change ho gaya tu. Har chiz mein tune debate kiya hai mere saath starting from whether I was a good dancer 😛 or that tulsi tea is a good concoction for immunity boosting or whether we should return to campus for the last time 😛. But it was all worth it in exchange for all the quantum gyan you have given me knowing that I don't even understand the a of quantum computing 😛. You are the most constant thing KD has ever boasted about. This went without saying for everyone entering KD: Find yourself bored ? Head over to Snehal's desk and indulge in some of his unique (and sometimes even dark) humor or tech talk. Good humor is something that you have gained and lost in the past few years, and is once again on the rise after the Goa Trip (my humor did have an influence I guess 😛). Finally happy to see you pursue your dream in Quantum ML, all the best for Oxford, future ke liye Europe tour zaroor plan karna durgesh ke saath!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a7c658819323d199d492be,Snehal  Raj
