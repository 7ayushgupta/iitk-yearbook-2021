1,"Hey Aamir ahmad makki- You asked ""what is wrong"" about others..WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU????..If you ask me,  an order of magnitude worse than us decent folks - scientist/GoI/people of India who is doing positive things  rather than filthy reprehensible and above all unhelpful posts you are posting..For someone connected with IITK, this is beyond shameful I do hope your colleagues are taking note of that (as I have) .

Let me give some perspective:  I and *all* my kids/family have gotten vaccinations - some (those who were doctors) in December 2021 as soon as they were eligible. I live in US but do have a lot of friends in India - virtually *everyone* got vaccinated. 

Most of us scientists and decent people are  doing what we can to fight the pandemic.  Modi's government, and Indian People in general has lot of good will here in US - this is why our President, realizing the help India gave US in the beginning, and others are doing what we can.

And here you are - peddling trash and mis-information.  Unnat Bharat Abhiyan IITK deserves better.  Your colleagues and IITK deserves better.  If you can't add anything positive, please refrain from doing harm.

This is not fun and games, it is NOT 'freedom of speech' or evil government coming after your freedom to  peddle nonsense. It is serious. People like you have done enough harm. Please stop it. 

PS. If you are so incompetent that you can't use a simple web application, like coWin,  find someone who can - instead of blaming someone else. 

And do wear a mask (ranting about Kumb Mela is not helpful), get vaccinated (Ranting about ""BJP vaccine is not helpful).",Rajat  Chaudhary,True,608b02e9819323d199d47111,Aamir Ahmad Makki
