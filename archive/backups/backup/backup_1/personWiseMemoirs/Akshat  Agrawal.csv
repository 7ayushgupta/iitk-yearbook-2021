1,"Mse ke top code, trader and much more . Bhai remember the time in 4th semester jab pure time classes Mai apan fb pe kuch kuch khelte rehte the those were great days. I admire how you are enthusiastic about everything there is on earth except the departmental courses 😛. Next time jab Delhi aao toh humse bhi mil lena.
Also City gonna lose the finals 😅😅",Akshat  Agrawal,True,60a39d25819323d199d47f04,Anuj Mayurkumar Shah

3,"We got to know each other from the Freshers inferno Initially I was a bit envious as everyone was like Batra header goal bhi maar raha, swimming Mai bhi phaad raha, Badminton Mai bhi chaap raha and I didn’t get to play TT and football games due to clashes. But soon after getting to know you I was happy ki yeh tennis nahi khelta 😛.  Playing football/ volleyball with you and Dtop was fun but playing against your wing uska mazza kuch aur hi tha.( inter wing semis ki loss was due to umpiring errors even you know it ). Also stop crediting your theory of negativity for us reaching the IFL semis it was the team that made it possible . 

I don’t know whether you will be a quantum computationalist( not sure if that’s a word 😛), physicists , chef or god knows what  but jo bhi hoga you would be the best in that field. Bas jab bhi next mile don’t be a chutiya jaise abhi hai and keep playing.
PS IFL 20 apna hi tha",Akshat  Agrawal,True,60a213e3819323d199d47cc0,Rishabh  Batra
