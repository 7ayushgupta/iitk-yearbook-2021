0,"Life in college would be incomplete without you. I have been subject to a lot of pranks in my four years and am pretty sure you were the mastermind in most of them. Will never forget your heartbreak with Nishita XD. Also, thank you for waking me up in the morning without asking you to do so ( Never mind the fact I still did not get up :P )

Despite all the fun, you were always focused on your studies and that would motivate me as well. I wish you all the successes in life. Stay the same and do keep in touch.
