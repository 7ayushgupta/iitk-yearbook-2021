0,"It has been great meeting you Durgesh - your care for your family and dedication towards work were very inspiring for me. The songs you shared, rasmalai, diwali night (and the way we made that dia), late night roaming in FB and writing on Prof’s board - all of it was really nice. You are a great friend to have and someone who cares a lot. I would like to hear you play violin sometime. And yeah, if possible, let’s stay in touch :) :).",Kanishka,True,60a5180f819323d199d4835d,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
1,"Hi Atishay,
Thanks for lending me the sum that time and also for helping out in 641 assignments. I really needed that amount back then.
All the best for your future :)",Kanishka,True,60a63fc5819323d199d48ccd,Atishay  Shrivastava
2,"Srivastavvv, Sunyyy, meri pyaari presi, the one with the cutest smile ever - tujhe haste hue dekh kar hi hasi aa jaati hai. Meko abhi imagine karte hue bhi aa rhi 😁! Haan re, boht time saath bitaya hai humne jisme kaafi not to be disclosed here waali cheezein bhi hain. HEC mein toh tere bina mera pta nhi kya hota! RO and washing machines ka chapoda, mail cc-ed to director for fixing newspaper stands aur kaise bhool sakte - endsems ke time saath baith kar hum room allocate kar rhe the😂! Antaragni security, HSS recitations, DumbC moves and we also made posters together for Candle Light March. Tu meko kitni baar cycle pe bhi bithai hai aur do you remember hum baarish mein bhi bheege the! Boht dhyaan rakha hai tune mera 4 saal mein❤️. Tujhse campus mein ek saal baad milkar boht achcha lga. Thanks for making us maggie. We tried chopsticks for the first time🥢. 
All of it was really fun and even trying to write all the memories we have made would be overly unfair to them. You are someone who is mature but have a child-like side to her and who cares a lot, not just for her friends but for everyone. My dear friend, it has been an honour knowing you🖖. Aur haan… Initially I thought of you as an ambivert but perhaps you are more of an introvert. Toh dhyaan rakhna tu apna. And… it’s definitely not a goodbye. Itna jaldi peecha nhi chodeinge… Na na. Hum ghoomne nhi gaye hain - meko jaana hai. Let’s go for a trip soon.
Tab tak ke liye… Tata!",Kanishka,True,60a6686f819323d199d48fb1,Maitreyee  Srivastava
3,"Haaannnn, hum dono haryana se hote hue bhi humari baat toh nhi hui last four years mein. Par meko apni 1st year ki CHM101 lab achche se yaad hai. Tum mujhse boht jyada haryanvi bolte the aur tu karke bolte the joh meko tab ajeeb lgta tha par koi same jagah se hai yeh dekhkar achcha bhi lgta tha. Overall the lab was fun and I found you very funny and a good person. Baad mein fir hum ek baar library ke aage mile the. Tab tum aise hi achanak se aake bole ki Y18 mein ek ladki Haryana se hai aur tum uska dhyaan rakhna, uski help karti rehana and thoda IITK ke baare mein bta dena. Phir yeh bol ke tum chale gye. Meko pehle boht ajeeb lga ki yeh achanak voh mujhe aake yeh kyon bol ke chala gya! But I liked to see that you cared for your juniors and it inspired me as well.

It was nice talking to you during the course and voh zoom waali chat (to everyone) was one of a kind… Yaad rahegi meko! I was kind of scared!

Aur.. Agli baar voh topi leke aate pakaa se. Abhi 1 saal bacha hai. Tum pehen ke ghumna. Milte dobara. Byee :) :)",Kanishka,True,60a5083b819323d199d4830b,Nikhil  Kumar
4,"Yo Buddu!
Practicing taekwondo in ground, doing stupid things, lying on the grass and laughing out loud was really fun. Kaafi masti ki club mein apan ne - especially with Simran and Hemant Bhaiya. Simran, tum aur main toh campus cycling trip pe bhi gye the and we took photos near the fountain. Aur haan, tumne mera important little rock kho diya tha (the day we went to give belt test in the bus) - won’t forget that😑! But koi na - it was a memorable day. We had a great time. 
It has been really nice having you as a friend😃. Have a wonderful life ahead! Wait… voh keyring bhi nhi di abhi tak tumne😑!
Chalo…  karte rehana baat kbhi kbhi!

5,"Hi Nitish,

Hall 3 batti club aake kaam karna was really fun. Humari maximum interaction batti club ke through hi hui na - even our first meet writing arduino codes during winter camp. You resolved LAN problem in my laptop. Fir summer projects in e-club - though we were not in the same team, you helped us throughout our project. You have helped me a lot in these 4 years - resolving random errors in codes, my UGP, research, info about courses and many more. Do you remember Ganeshotsav - it was nice and prasad was really good! And did I ever tell you - I had a hard time believing when you told me you were in drams😛! Aur… how enthusiastic you were after becoming baapu - tumne apne bachchon se milwaya bhi! Keep caring, the way you do, for your juniors and people around you. 

I wish we could have spent some more time together. I still have the reusable paper, lens and smiley and learnt a lot from How to win friends and influence people!  You are a very honest, innocent and kind-hearted soul. It’s an honour to have you as a friend😃.

All the best for your future. Prof. banke students ko jyada bore mat karna (tumhare L12 mein FPGA ke lecture ke time hum so gye the😛)

Until we meet again… Bye",Kanishka,True,60a63676819323d199d48c1c,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
