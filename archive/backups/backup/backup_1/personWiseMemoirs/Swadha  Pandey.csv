0,"First of all, let me apologise for the fact that Manish Sisodia is not my dad. Dude I am also so glad we got covid together, I wouldn't have survived those 17 days otherwise. But somehow with all the movie nights, gossip sessions, and the mini-Holi, those ended up being some of the best days. Thanks for always making fun of my 'crying', and for introducing me to the best chicken tikka rice. You better visit me in the US now, and maybe we can finally watch Cast Away then (not). And always remember, *attitude for beauty*",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2b34c819323d199d47df4,Dishaa  Rajora
1,"I’m wondering whether I should write you a memoir or just make weird noises to convey emotion. You’re the coolest and I already miss your amazing style of telling stories. Will always hate you for dare night, and I’m totally going to steal your first year waala green kurta one day. Thank you for supporting my morning alcoholism. Biryani, random gossip sessions, and rooftop nights are some of my fav memories from the last days of college and I need more of that on the trip. Okay, love you, see you.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a65a0a819323d199d48eb2,Anshika  Verma
2,"Whenever I came to Priya’s room, I would try to figure out whether tu blankets mein chhupi huyi hai ya nahi, you would literally disappear into them. I always admired how you stayed calm and chill and still killed it in everything you did. Also will forever worship your chipkali bhagaane ki skills.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a89ba2819323d199d4939e,Arzoo
3,"Hi physics buddy, thanks for getting me through some of the most annoying courses ever *coughs*fluids*coughs*. Wish we could’ve done more music club events together, but covid had other plans. I remember you used to be super awake and alive in all the morning classes and I’d just be sleepwalking through them all, I have to say I really admire that. Hope you have a super amazing physics career and maybe we can make an evil gravitational wave death star someday (don’t ask me how, you and Shyamal can work out the theory).",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a37532819323d199d47e98,Ashwin  Girish
4,"Avaniii yaar I have so much to say about you, you've just been the absolute sweetest person since day one. You're my OG nap partner, and first year music club bitching sessions will always be my fav. Trying to sing the aashayein harmonies and laughing our asses off on stage was one of the most fun club experiences. The best performance ever was obv Swing (love youuu). I will never stop fangirling over your part in Routine. 

I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together during the last months, with all the photoshoots, bulla sessions, and biryani making. Thanks for getting my inhaler to the rooftop, I guess I owe you my life now. Also thanks for always giving us emergency volini, odomos, and snacks.

P.S. A+A 4eva",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2ab71819323d199d47dcb,Avani  Shrivastava
5,"We hung out properly only when we were being kicked out of campus, but those were some of the best days. You are the best person to party and dance with, because you never let it end. I also remember how you always had extra buckets anytime I needed them in the last four years. You’re super sweet but also crazy, and I absolutely love that xx",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a89935819323d199d49396,Deeksha  Yadav
6,"I remember the first time we met, you came up to us and asked us to be in your art105 group because tere group mein ‘ladkiyaan nahi hain.’ I will always make fun of you for that. Bro I am so glad we got to hangout in VH, because tujhe torture karke hi toh quarantine nikla hum sabka. Also, a kettle is not a dishwasher, and voyeurism is illegal. Chal abb US mein milte hain, you’re an amazing human and I’m glad I got to know you.
P.S. Faizan kuchh gossip bata na",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a377f4819323d199d47e9c,Faizan  Siddiqui
7,"Medhaaa, I have always been in awe of how many things you excelled at, you’re so insanely talented. Your stories always made me laugh so hard, I need more late night gossip sessions yaar. Teri yaad mein none of us could make coffee for the last two days after you left. I would apologise for drenching you with water jiss din humein college se nikaala gaya, but we all know you deserved it. I remember our conversation around application time about how we would get rejected from everywhere, but abb toh seedha Seattle mein coffee pilaayegi tu. Please keep posting reels till then, okay see you soon.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a66230819323d199d48f4d,Medha  Agarwal
8,"You will always be a legend to me because of *that* dance move and *that* story about something happening in 2 seconds. I know we only got to hangout properly towards the end but I’m so glad we did, you’re amazing and gorgeous and a genius makeup artist. The last campus night with the ouija board in your room is one of my fav IITK memories. (Also how was your room always so pretty?) Okay abb wing trip pe chalte hain.

9,"""Chhoo mat mujhe"" -You to me for the last 4 years. I'm so glad you joined the club, and galaxy was always just the most fun with you. Whatever the position, I just loved the hangouts and the planning and us trying to make a band with no synth players. You're so super talented, please never stop making music. ",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2b5d7819323d199d47dfb,Pragya  Patel
10,"B609, B202<3 The fact that we passed first sem PE will always be a miracle. Thank you for dealing with my late night sleepwalking(?) and all my weird habits, and for being my partner in avoiding the HEC har event mein fraud maarne ke liye. I remember tu har music club event mein aati thi just for my performance, mujhe support karne, and I just want to say that I appreciated that so so much, thank you yaar :’) I miss our random gossip sessions, your mom’s chocolate barfi, your emotional breakdowns every time there was a chipkali in the room, your mirror dance sessions, us running for TA lectures and eating homeopathy medicine as breakfast, and a million other memories that will stay with me forever. Oh and, #iamfashion
Love you",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2bc37819323d199d47e0e,Ritika  Ajmera
11,"It was always great talking to you, and the annoying literature project would have been impossible to do without you (and without bitching about it together). You are one of the sweetest people and I’m glad I got to know you, hope you have an amazing future <3",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a89e9a819323d199d4939f,Sunamya  Gupta
12,"Hi co-coordi, thanks for making the club and our tenure super fun, tere bina club nahi chalta for sure. Too bad we never got a proper last performance but year end treat ke paise toh bache. Here's to your infinite song suggestions from first year, may they rest in peace.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a36fb5819323d199d47e90,Mayant  Mukul
13,"From first year PE to eng bitching sessions to fourth year quarantine, I'm glad I got to do them with you because you made it all infinitely more fun. I remember your first year phase when you just waved to people on Messenger, and that was our whole conversation (one of the most meaningful conversations I’ve ever had, I have to say). You're an absolute boss and I know you’re going to kill it in life, hope we meet again sometime soon xx",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a372f4819323d199d47e95,Thanya  B
