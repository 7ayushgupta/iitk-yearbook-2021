1,"Let me begin by quoting our friend Peter Porker- 'How dare you fucking say pleasure?' 
It's funny how our friendship originated from Facebook comments. Knowing you and your humor has been great for me. You have a humble presence which makes it very easy to approach you, even from other people's phones xD.",Avisha,True,60a68669819323d199d490b1,Pulkit  Pandey
2,"I remember the first time we talked was when you suddenly came up to me asking for a picture together on the fresher's night. You were always very straightforward and easy to talk to. I think we were destined to embarrass ourselves since the day we opted for the fashion show. But, it was a little less embarrassing with you people around me. Although we haven't been in touch lately, I cherish our time together in the first year (exchanging waves on messenger :P).",Avisha,True,60a685af819323d199d490ac,Shivam  Arya
