From praveen ki gaaliyan to coordis ki gaaliyan, from courses ki BT to life ki BT, from VH me paani laane jaana to FL shop me daaru laane jaana, from “Hi” to “aur bsdk”,  its been a great journey together. <3 Well, the ending is a bit hazy. But you know what? If you dont like the ending, it prolly isnt the ending at all.

Aajkal my morning dose of dopamine is the memes and reels you send me on insta. Please don't stop doing that. <3 

Love you . Miss you a lot.

2,"From ""Ei tui bangali"" to ""bhai yearbook likhish"". From first bengali friend to one of the best friends in college. It was a great journey pal. You have contributed so much to my growth. I hope I did something similar. We'll catch up soon. Coffee house -> Vibe to manna dey -> Hoppipola -> Terribly bhand -> rastai ghum.

3,"Adzoooooo (okay, dramebaazi yahin pe khatam)
Cant believe we're finally here. At each other's yearbook. Wish we could do this in person, but ""it is what it is"", right? From birthday pe mujhe cake na khilana to SOC me mujhe bachana, we sure have come a long way. And we both know it doesn't end here. Cause I really don't like the way we had to say our goodbyes. 
You've always been a bliss and I'm glad we got to know each other. PS: tere batch reels were gold XD 
And yeah we should pawriii soon. (AND WE WILLLLLL !!! <3 ) And next trip (yeah that's gonna happen) pe we should do that ""scaring the shit out of priyal"" thing again xDDD that was FUN :p 
Take care and stay safe madam :33 ",Sagnik  Mukherjee,True,608906e5819323d199d46ead,Arzoo

Every moment with you has been a bliss. If you remember, CS me pehla birthday tera celebrate hua tha. What a blast we had !! Then dheere dheere opening up, getting to know each other. Its been great honestly. You've always (ALWAYS) been a great inspiration and an amazing buddy. Intern ka experience same nahi hota tumhare alawa (MEAN IT !!!). Hope to see you soon and miss you a lot. Wish you all the best mere bhai <3 .

Saath me train kab kr rhe hai apan dono ?

Okay enough dramebaazi, and fomo to anyone else reading this.
What a gem you are mama, one of the jolliest and craziest dudes i've met in campus. Physics-baaji theke maagi-baji, sob ii to korle xDD. Ektu gorib keo sekhao. (oops, bengali again lmao)
Yes, jokes aside, Love you bhai. It was more that just ""our paths crossed"" i guess. And Im proud and grateful for that. Touch e thakish. Parle call korish gorib take. Bhalo lage.

6,"Oh, you're finally here. <3 Lemme structure the thoughts. 3....2.....1..... okay it is gonna take time. I'll just start and spew everything that comes. 
Love you bro. Always loved how you could cheer up the entire room just with your presence. Undoubtedly one of the best peeps i've come across in campus. Dono WB me rehte hai bhai. We can catch up anytime. And we will do that soon. Call krte rehna. Bulla kaatne k liye i'm always up as you know xD. I still remember ek entire evening faaltu ki baato me bita dena tere saath (met at lunch and tu room tak aaya baat krte hue and we kept talking xDDD). We never had that beer-bulla session we planned (just before covid, we were supposed to do that just after the ""small"" vacation). We will do that as well.
Miss you buddy. Take care. Stay hydrated xDD.

“You probably know me by all that Spamming on Facebook.” ? Nah bruh, I know you for reasons beyond that. Don’t I?


One smart dude once told me “10 saal baad sab koi ghis rhe honge, what will matter is tere paas baat krne kayak koi hai ki nahi”. And yeah within a second your name striked my mind. That’s how much you mean to me. 

Thanks for making my campus life so wonderful. Thanks for being the person you are. And above all, thanks for existing. 

I miss you everyday. We vibed on day one. And we’ll keep vibing till the last day. Baaki tu roomie to ban hi rha hai mera <3. Mast pawrii krenge :33 

Wish you all the luck bhai <3 . I miss you a lot.

8,"Okay first things first Priyal Bhandari !! Why are our yearbook statuses so similar ? What evil sorcery is this ? (read in my voice ofc)

Thanks for not telling anyone ki kaise mujhe chhodne aana padhta tha hall 5 :”( .
I will always remember “bure aadat chupane chahiye saaagnik” and many other stuff you casually taught me. Whenever we say “summers”, we mean “2nd year summers” by default. Ig the summer of ‘19 deserves that much. 

Scaring the shit out of you with arzoo was FUN, “maneer panchurian” was FUN, Orientation ‘19 was FUN. goa was FUN. The “ahem” session was FUN. And yeah hanging out with you was FUN (always). <3

Thanks for keeping me company while tum log pawrii kr rhe the (VC isnt half bad ig). Wish you all the luck and miss you a lot (The most cliched sentence in every memoir, cant skip this one :p, but yeah, I do miss you). :”(( 
Reels bhejte rehna (khud ki nahi, FUN wale)
Okay, kaafi lamba ho gaya (also, TWSS). So baibai.

Thanks bruh. We have interacted a lot, and I've learnt a lot from you. It was fun working with you and it was fun doing random bulla sessions as well. Keep in touch and take care <3 <3 .",Sagnik  Mukherjee,True,60a67014819323d199d48ff2,Ratnesh  Argal
10,"Okay this is hard (ngl, and definitely not gonna be dramatic)
You prolly are the only FRIEND friend in campus, (or maybe in life) jar sathe I had fights eto frequently. And yet we eventually got back to where we were (back to basics basically lol).
Thanks for helping me go through many tough times, and making me listen to ""new rules"" , ""levitating"" and what not xDD (Guess Im fond of a little torture :pp)

Wish you all the luck (although you never needed it, neither you will) for your future. You're tough and strong. And you're doing enough to make everyone around you so proud of you. Just wanted you to know that. 
My college life wouldn't be the same without you, I hope you know that as well. Thanks for everything. Take care and stay safe.

11,":'))) aur bhosdi ?
Please tell me we will meet firse !! I still had kitne saare plans with you all. Trivial shit likhne ka matlab nahi banta yahan pe, cause I know you will probably be the finest of us all. And sentimental banne ka bhi point nahi hai, cause ""got your back jack"" is pretty mutual i guess. I will just keep it simple then. 
Every moment with you was a bliss. I've learnt so much from you, and I can never be grateful enough for that (NEVER). (Well, these are stuff, I cant say in person, sooo)
Love you bro. Take care. Miss you a lot. 
Thankss for everything TanTan <3 ",Sagnik  Mukherjee,True,608d0810819323d199d47628,Tanishq  Patil
