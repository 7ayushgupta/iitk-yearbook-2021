0,"Hey Kiran !!
We met each other through Sireesha. We don’t share a lot of memories together but I would say that you are a cheerful person. Chill se courses kese lene h y to tumse hi seekhna chahiye. Sireesha hmesha kehti thi ki Kiran ne liya h course to achha hi hoga. Apn ne Sath m Research paper requirement wale mahaan course jhele to UGP ki rahat bhi dekhi. Tumne 413 m work divide ki nautanki face ki aur power cut ki majboori bhi. Partner ke yha bhi electricity shutdown to data handler ke ha bhi shutdown. Instead of losing your cool, you tried to settle the matter patiently. I appreciate your efforts and team-spirit. 
Take care ❤. Best wishes and good luck for your future. ",Vipin,True,60a4b3a0819323d199d48195,Kiran Kumari Meena
1,"Krishan urf Kanhaiya, kya bole ab aapke bare m aap to prabhu h XD. BTop pr FBM ki scholarship se shuru huyi batein socha nhi tha ki itni anmol dosti de dengi. Krishan se kab Kanhaiya pr pahunch gye pta hi nhi chla. Tumne IITK ka har kona dekha h. Har jagah ko explore kiya h. Tumhara room pr hi movie nights hoti thi kyunki roomie to room pr rehta nhi tha. Kanpur ki shopping aur late pahunchkr theatre m dekhne wali movies bahut yaad aayengi. Hall 2 ka canteen band hone ke karan apn ne na jane kitne kathi roll mangwaye. Har raat krte the ki kal se nhi mangwayenge aur phir agli raat bhi yhi bat bolte the. Abdullah ke biscuit-chips drawer m bacha kr rakhte the taki koi aaye aur kha jaye. Raat ko mess ke saamne se paani lana aur series ke gappe marna. Mene jo bhi random series dekhi h, unko bas tumhe hi recommend kr skta ho kyunki aur koi to dekhta nhi tha unko. Kafi multi-dimensional ho tum. Tumhara bas chale to sare adventure ke kaam abhi poore kr lo. Apne kaam ko lekr kafi passionate rehte ho. Log chahe kuchh bhi kahe pr tum apni bat pr datkr khade rehte ho. Aese hi thodi SOS ke coordi bne ho 😁. Y to aese hi h, y to aese hi h, krte krte kafi kuchh chamatkar kiye tumne, chahe Panasonic ki intern ho ya Harvard ki conference. Khi pta chle bad m UPSC bhi tumne aese hi nikal di. Chhoti chhoti baton se lekr badi badi mushkilon m hmesha support kiya h. No matter what the situation is, tum kbhi motivate krna nhi chhode, you always had my back 🥰❤.
Bahar jane se pehle muh dhokr apne special comb se hmesha bal sawarte the, halanki bad m bhi wo wese hi rehte the 😜. Aasha h ki Tumhari, meri aur rajat ki dosti aese hi aage chalti rahegi. Sadly na to Manali trip ho payi aur na hi Dehradun wali, iss bar jab mauka milega tab pkka chlenge. Hoping to meet you soon.
Ab life ka ek nya safar shuru hone wala h. All the best for your future endeavours buddy. Aur koi glti huyi ho to maaf kr dena prabhu, apna Sudarshan chakra se prahar mt kr dena hum pr 😂.

2,"Naam h Piyush, pr aapko pyar se sab aapko Raja Babu bolte h. Agr Raja Babu bolte h to aap iss title ke hakdar bhi h, reason: your likeable and pleasant personality. I aspire to have a great personality like you. You treat everyone with respect. You are the glue which holds the group together. You think of others before yourself. You are a keen observer. You exert warm aura of hospitality. On one hand, you have the elderly side of sorting out others differences, on the other hand you possess playful side as well. I have never seen you furious for yourself. If others wrong themselves, I have seen your caring side. I wonder how much patience you have. There is a threshold for caring others. But your care has no bounds. Coming into your room, I have never seen you indulging in your work rather than welcoming others. You are introspecting yourself every day. Your time utilizing skills are commendable. Revisiting your whole schedule of day in mind, and then assessing what changes can be made to optimise time further. You are empathetic. You are sincere to your feelings. Your learning agility, optimism and zeal to contribute for the betterment of the society are beyond praise. You have the quality of leader as well as traits of a good team member. You aspire to be IAS in near future. I am just gonna say that buddy go for it, you have my best wishes. You have what it takes to crack the exam and bear the responsibilities. You are a man of golden heart. You cherish your every single friend. Photography, calligraphy, reading books, writing your thoughts and noting down the impressive phrases are some of your hobbies. My yearbook dp was also clicked by you and it came out amazing thanks to your photography skills. Photography ki bat chl rhi h to Saini ko kese bhool skte h, apne group m to tum dono roomies hi shandaar photographer ho. 
In the last 1.5 months, I get to know you more closely. We played dumb charades and cards, watched movies, sang karaoke in last few months and everything is memorable. Mama-mio to air strip we covered many things and made our last campus memories. Photo-session to last feast at campus, pretty much everything emerged from your mind and could have happened because of your perseverance. From meeting Piyush to getting to know Raja Babu, I have learnt a lot of things from you. From being outlier to assimilating with everyone, you have supported and motivated me. Our friendship is invaluable as well as irreplaceable. I am blessed to have you as friend💕. Bas sachche pyaar milne wala scene nhi ho paya, pr wo bhi mil jayega bhai, aakhirkar achchi cheezen milne m waqt lagta h. 
I am certain that you will soar higher and achieve new heights. Good luck and best wishes for your future journey. Aur haan, jo plans bnaye h job krne ke time ke, wo bhi poori ho jayenge, bas thoda sa aur patient rho y waqt favourable nhi h. Bas waqt ki ek khasiyaat h ki y nikal jaata h. Corona kaal bhi nikal jayega. And then you would have plenty of time to accomplish everything you planned. 
I am not letting you go and you are not the one who forgets friends as time passes by. So, we would be in touch😜. Hoping to meet you soon🤗. Last m yhi kahunga ki bahut nek dil insaan ho tum ❤.

3,"SG ki workshop se apni mulakat huyi aur TA ki lab se dosti shuru huyi. Time ke sath apna bond aur bhi gehra ho gya. Chahe TA m fraud maarna ho ya phir MOS jese course ko jhelna, sab apn ne sath m nikale. Inn sab harkaton ki wajah se to ek time pr mere khud ke department wale mujhe Civil dept ka smjhte the. Kanhaiya ke room pe movie night ya phir raat ko roll mangwana (tum logon ko to egg roll m hi mzza aata h hmesha) y sab batein bahut yaad aayengi. 
Bas 2 mode hi hote h tumhare : Normal mode aur Masti mode. Jab kbhi exam ka pressure jyada badh jata tha ya phir library m Numerical methods smjh nhi aata tha, tumhara Masti mode activate ho jaata tha. Aur jab Masti mode activate hota tha to kbhi academic area m ghoomna hota tha to kbhi DOAA canteen m chai. Z-square bas isliye jaana ki mujhe shopping krni h, tum hmesha taiyaar rehte the. Aur apni theatre wali movies, pta nhi kon panauti h apne m se pr apn movies m hmesha late ho jate the. Mujhe aaj bhi yaad h jab apn log EDM gye the, wo meri pehli EDM thi but uss raat itne mzze kiye ki wo hmesha yaadgar rhegi. Tum, m aur Kanhaiya apn jodi kafi nayab h, umeed h aage bhi aese hi barkarar rhegi. (🙈🙉🙊 )
Kafi logon ki help ki h tumne. Mene kbhi madad ke liye mna krte nhi dekha tumhe.  Mujhe hmesha motivate kiya h tumne despite my continuous complaining. You were always there for me in my failure as well as my little successes ❤. Apne kaam ko lekr to kafi dedicated and hardworking ho aap. Aesi thodi har kisi ko aage se prof bolta h - “Tumhe kaha jana h Btech ke bad, btao, m doonga recommendation”. 
Tumhari life ka ek nya chapter shuru hone wala h. Best of luck on your future journey aur aese hi chhapte rehna hmesha. Hoping to meet you soon. Aur haan apni trip pending h abhi, hopefully iss bar poori hogi👻.

4,"Hello Raman!!
Log pyaar se Lamba bulate h aapko. Same coaching institute tha apna. Pr IITK m aakr hi mulaqaat huyi pehli bar. Pehle bhai bne aur phir sath m SG bhi bne. Poori wing m bas tum hi the mere dept se. Apni dosti dept ke courses jab sath krne lage tab jyada gehri huyi. Stata pe regression chlana, Somesh ka research paper likhna aur ab murli ke liye paper likhna, sab sath m kiya. Kitne ghatiya ghatiya course kiye apn ne sath me. Logon ki himmat nhi hoti aese courses lene ki. But apn ne liye aese courses. Some examples are: MOS, Numerical methods, Game Theory and finally IME. Last one was unpredictable. We didn’t know that there is an ounce of possibility that this course could be this labour intensive (eco se h to eco ki analogy to use kre😜) and shitty. You are the best teammate that I met at IITK. There were groups in many courses. But, courses in which we were a group didn’t feel difficult despite being cumbersome. Somehow, we knew how to finish the work.  We just divided our work and there were no differences whatsoever among us regarding work. Through you, I get to know many of our dept mates.
One of the best qualities you possess is hard work.  You genuinely put efforts to achieve your goal. Placement se pehle bahut chinta thi ki pta nhi kesa hoga, kaha hoga. But you never lost faith in yourself and emerged as a better version of yourself. Aur bhai ne phir ne OYO m placement lagwayi😀.
I highly appreciate your passion for sports, anime, movie and TV-series. You manage your time efficiently. You know exactly how much time to spend on study and how much on sports and anime 😜. Tv-series, movies ki recommendation leni ho ya Anime ki gup-shup, you are my go-to person. Agr kisi ko mere alawa saaf room rkhte huye dekha h to wo tum ho. You cleaning skills are far more superior than mine. Buddy, you have grown a lot. From taking chill courses to struggling with difficult courses and acing them. Tumhari padhne ki speed to lazawaab h ⚡⚡, bhai itna jldi koi kese padh skta h 😂😂. You are a little shy with the girls. Pr bhai nervous hone ki jagah, confidence se bolo jo bolna h. I am giving you this advice because I know tum kbhi kisi ko disrespecting aur hurt krne wale shabd nhi bologe. 
As this is our memoir, so I wanna confess something. I was hesitant to tell anyone about my crush and the reason was that our crush is the same person 😂😂. Maybe it was childish not to tell anyone, but yeah it happened 😂.
Almost sare sports khel liye tumne. Cricket, volleyball, basketball se lekr badminton tak. Cricket as a CPA to captaincy of volleyball, you evolved. Yaad h tumhe tum Dual bas isliye krna chahte the taki ek aur Inter-IIT khel pao aur apni team ko jeeta kr le aao. Your intense enthusiasm for sports is praiseworthy. 
You genuinely care for your friends. They are like haemoglobin of you blood. Our friendship can’t be described in words. We have great synergy together and we are a team always ❤. You have helped me throughout my whole IITK journey. Whether it is acads problem or my regular struggles😅, you always motivated me and said “Chill hai, sab badhiya hoga, chinta mat kr, sath m dekh lenge apn”. Enthu ki koi kami nhi h tumme. Semester start hone se lekr grades ka result aane tum dussa la rhe hote ho😁. Buddy, keep this positive attitude with you always and never lose your simplicity.
You have entered a new phase of your life. Good luck for your future endeavours. Apn to pass m hi rehte h to milter rhenge. Love you brother 💖.
P.S.: Agr lamba so rha h to koi bhool kr bhi shor mt krna wrna anzaam achcha nhi hoga😂, lamba ko neend bahut pyari h😴😴.",Vipin,True,60a65e7a819323d199d48f10,Raman  Lamba
5,"Rohit urf chouhan, aapki jitni taarif kre utni kam h. Aap se rajat ke through mulakaat huyi aur progoders ke through apni batein shuru huyi. Sadly apn log late mil paaye. But jitna bhi time apn ne saath m bitaya wo worthwhile tha. Aap kafi selfless aur helpful insaan ho. Ek mentor wali quality dikhti h tumme. Hmesha welcoming mahaul rehta h tumhare paas. DS m bahut help mili h aapse, uske liye m tahe dil se shukriya ada krta ho. Sadgi se bharpoor h aap, use kbhi mt khona. Kehte ho “bhula na dena humko”, are aap aese insaan ho hi nhi jisko bhulaya ja ske ❤. Good luck on your new journey 😉. Aese hi aage badhte rho aur nyi unchaiyyon ko chhote rho. Hoping to meet you soon. ",Vipin,True,60a137e0819323d199d47c40,Rohit  Chouhan
6,"Hey dear roomie !! 
You are the first Y17 I met in campus. From bhai to roomie to more than a real brother, this was our journey in short. When I came back to campus in 2nd semester, I vividly remember you saying this to one of our batchmates in Hall 2 canteen – “Bhai abhi abhi aaya h Vipin, thoda time do isko, go easy on him, isko draoo mt wapas thodi bhejna h”. It was not that our batchmate was intimidating me, but you understood the gravity of situation I was in and you were protecting me. That was your usual self. You would have done the same thing if anyone else were in my shoes. But Your kind gesture led be to believe that I am not alone. There are people rooting for me to recover and emerge stronger.
You see the best in everything. I am not saying that you don’t see the downfalls. Yes, you can see the both sides of the coin but you don’t ever let negative side dominate the positive side. You have an aura of warm hospitality. Anyone can seek guidance from you on any matter. I have learnt a lot of things from you. Being happy and calm despite difficulties tops this list. You were my home away from home. Thanks to you, I always feels that I have someone who would listen to me without any prejudices whatsoever. You are like a mentor, brother, friend everything wrapped in one.
Choosing you as my roommate was my best decision ever. If I can go back in time, then I would also do the same. From leaving IITK to not been able to leave IITK, I have evolved. I think I couldn’t have gotten my confidence back without your constant support. You always had my back. You never let me face difficulties alone. You motivated whenever I was down. You corrected me whenever I made mistakes. 
You are multidimensional. Who would have thought that sudden senator nomination could lead to the 3rd most vote counts. You are people person. Public speaking is your territory. I have never seen anyone so confident in getting A in HSS😂. You have vast knowledge in almost everything. You are hardworking. You can do anything if you decide to put your mind to it. From cracking into GS interview in intern drive to securing job at Blackrock, everyone has witnessed your hard work.
From learning French at IITK to learning Sanskrit at Mattur (Karnataka) in future, you have diverse array of interests. Cracking UPSC, opening NGO, donating for social cause, working as a social activist these are some things on your bucket list. You have zeal to try new things. OnePlus tagline “Never Settle” can be said as epitome of your life motto. I am lucky to have an amazing person like you by my side. Love you brother 🥰❤. I would definitely miss the random talks we used to have for hours lying in bed for hours. I don’t think I have to say it, but for the sake of memoir I am going to say it – we are not parting ever. Our bond is not that weak to be broken by passage of time.
You are off to a new journey of your life. Best of luck for your future endeavors and keep spreading positivity. Your smile is contagious, it need needs no reason, keep brightening the world with it.
Itna bda likh diya mene 😂. Roomie ka asar to aayega hi 😜.
