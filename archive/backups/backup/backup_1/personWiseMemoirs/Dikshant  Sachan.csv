2,"Meme Lord Dewansh! In 4 saalo me ye samajh aaya ki tu ek chhota sa bachcha hai giant body me. Tere playlists bahot hi wierd hoti hain lekin firbhi achi lagti hain.

It is just not possible to fit everything in this memoir so i will just mention the key terms. NCL nightouts, patri, suro k sasur, doaa canteen, intern days, cheating in group, acid, and many more. Also Dikshant Sachan from P&D pvt. ltd. signing off                   until Bangalore.",Dikshant  Sachan,True,60a642e8819323d199d48d0b,Pragyan  Pandey
5,"It started off with some childish fights, I used to cover you up with your quilt and give you some thumps. Thanks for arranging the notes for me, thanks for all the help in exams also thanks for all the coffee. Tere paas har chij kaise hoti hai just to mention one, 9 amp ka fuse bhi tha tere paas jab mujhe jarurat thi.  You are Doraemon to my Nobita.",Dikshant  Sachan,True,60a64311819323d199d48d0e,Sajal  Chaurasia
