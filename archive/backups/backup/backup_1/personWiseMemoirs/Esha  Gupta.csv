Yaar apan pehle 2 saalon mein kam hee baat karte the but jab bhi karte the bahut mazza aata tha. Tu bahut hee cute aur sweet hai yaar <3. Fir Topology ke course mein apni kaafi baat hui. Yaad hai wo lamba sa session tere room mein jab humne bahut der baat kari thi. And thank you so much for our awesome pizza date. Yaaar, tu actually bahut pyaari hai <3<3<3

Wish you an awesome life ahead and hope hum dobara mile.",Esha  Gupta,True,60a676d1819323d199d4903d,Chitranshi  Singh
1,"Yaar, Sahi Kaha tune, even though hum dono first year se astro club mein hai but coordie banne se pehle zyaada baat Nahi hui thi. But uss summer mein actually bahut mazza aaya tha, especially wo Shobhan Mandir ka observation session. One of the best nightouts tha wo, although mujhe koi bhi star Nahi dikha tha sky mein (like always). Astro club toh best adda ban Gaya tha, wahin khaana, sona, bachchon ke saath meetings karna. Tarish toh pizza bhi rooftop pe deliver karaata tha 😂😂. Wo 4 ghante Ka food discussion toh best tha!! Bahut mazza aaya Yaar tere Saath kaam karke, waise toh tune poora club mostly single handedly hee sambhaala.
Wish you all the good luck in life and hopefully mujhe bhi Teri Tarah sky mein taare dikhne shuru ho jaaye.😂",Esha  Gupta,True,60a7fd00819323d199d4930e,Naveen

Sabse pehle toh you are the best roommate and neighbour I ever had. You introduced me to the world's best alarm tune :P From the beginning, I always admired you for your friendly nature and motivated attitude. And above that, we had so much fun together in the first year. One of my best memories of college is that EDM in which we danced like crazy. And then we became roommates. And although our schedules didn't usually match up, the small chit-chat or gossip sessions were the best. I remember waking up to the smell of delicious soup in the middle of the night when you came after your dance practice. Also, thanks for taking me to the HC in the middle of the night when I had an ant in my ear (which I actually thought to be a bat in the beginning ._.). And next time se kisi achi movie ke saath year shuru karenge :)

From being neighbours to roommates to neighbours again, you were an actual constant in my college life.

I hope you have a beautiful life ahead with a lot less annoying alarm and a better sleep schedule :P Hope we meet again and dance it out again.
