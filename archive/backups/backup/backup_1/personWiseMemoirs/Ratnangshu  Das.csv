1,"You were one of the most well-arranged and meticulous guys I have met, which is very rare in IITs. Kabhi kabhi overconfidence mein hag deta tha, but there jaisa sincere both kam hi dekha h. Also itna saaf kaise rakh leta tha room. . . .

And AOB KS . . . will really miss those PUBG nights. 

Unfortunately is bar nhi mile, but hopefully future trip pe milenge.

2,"Yoo Moond.
Chalta firta imdb h tu. Wing cricket se leke bulla sessions. You have given us a lot of memories to cherish. From Psych to the classic ""nimbu --> dahi"" jokes, you have given us a lot of laughs.

And I have huge respect for you. You were the butt of many of our jokes, but you gracefully handled all of them, which not a lot of people can do. So keep up the good spirit and hopefully jldi kisi trip pe milenge.",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a63cf1819323d199d48c88,Aditya
3,"Humanoid mein mile the first time . . . lol . . . seems like a whole different life. Not a lot of time there, but definitely enough to realise how hardworking and intelligent you were. Shahsi ka code see like ROS, sab tu hi karta that tab.

But still mech mein kaafi memories (not just memories :) ) share kiye and end take collaboration atut raha.

4,"Yoo bhai . . . 

I don't remember ki kab pehli baar mile the, but feels like you were always there. JRK ke ki class mein boredom dur karne mein kaafi help kiya. Roz alag alag games ki suggestion lata tha. And mech mein waise collaborations ke liye bhi thank you.

Also a lot of memories through those crazy pubg games . . . lol. Abhi toh pubg aane ke baad virtually milte rahenge.",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a64283819323d199d48d01,Bhavjeet  Singh
5,"LG . . .  
Xin . . . 


But Jokes apart. Kafi intelligent h tu. In spite of wasting all the time playing with us, you still managed to succeed amazingly and that's a sign of sheer brilliance. But uske sath ""Bhola"" bhi h , which counters all of that IRL.
Anyways, thank you for all the good memories and content for VBK. 

Milte h kahi foreign trip pe ;-;",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a63492819323d199d48c02,Bholeshwar  Khurana

I don't know if you remember, first-year mein ""startup "" ka plan leke html sikhne chale the hum. Lol.
But you gave me a lot of memories to cherish. From wing crickets, to our trip. 
Also both much sikha bhi h. Hardworking, persistent and focused. You have all the golden qualities. Just pose dena sikh ja, fir Korea mein macha dega . . . ",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a63b69819323d199d48c72,Harsh  Agarwal

9,"Aur bhai

abb yaadein kya hi likhu . . . there are too many good memories to jot down in such a small place. Kaafi kuch sikha h tujhse. You worked too hard and are prolly very hard rn as well. But still managed a lil bit time for the bulla sessions with your insightful inputs. 

Baas bade aadmi banke bhul mat jana . . . . . .

A lot of good memories from FAC. Also tujhe hall take chodne jana only to prove that ""Chivalry is not dead"" . . . XD
But there liye dhang ka ""nickname"" dhund hi nhi paya and you kept on calling me ""Bengoli"" .. . ;-;

Anyways take care and Hyderabad ka Biryani pending h",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a6324d819323d199d48bdb,Monika  Rathore
11,"Aree bhai . . . .
You are probably the most sincere student I have met. Itna kaise padh lete ho. Abhi bhi yaad h, thermo mein jab hum sir ke notes khole bhi nhi the, tu book ke peeche problems solve karne laga tha. In fact hume toh book ka pata bhi nhi tha.
But achha h. Tumhare jaise sincere students hi desh ka naam raushan karenge . . . . . . ",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a63395819323d199d48bf1,Prateek  Yadav
12,"Bhai bhai bhai
You were one of the nicest human beings I came across on campus . . . .

Start saath mein water polo khel ke hua that . . .  XD
Fir every other day mess mein tu aur Vidit dikhte rehte the . 

Chalo take care . . . Hopefully we'll meet soon.",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a62ecb819323d199d48baa,Priank  Prasad

A long way from there. You have succeeded and showed your maturity in ways I could never imagine. 
While I am very sure you will do great things in your life, AOB.MMC toh alag hi  banda lagta h. Cheers to all the great PUBG memories (all 4 of us stuck at different places in Livik map and facing a slow zone death . . . lol).

Hopefully future mein milenge",Ratnangshu  Das,True,60a64452819323d199d48d2b,Yash  Maheshwari
