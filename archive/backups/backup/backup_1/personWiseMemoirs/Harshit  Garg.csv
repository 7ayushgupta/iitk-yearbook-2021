3,Hi bro!!! We have had so much fun that it is difficult to recall all of them. From playing late night basketball to literally spending my whole day at your room. Bohot pareshan kiya hai maine tereko but kya karun mazza hi itna aata tha. Har samay tereko canteen jaane ka bolta tha aur kisi tarah le hi jaata tha. Fest mein kitna fun kiya hum logo ne chahe kanpur mein ho ya delhi. You were also so good to me always and I cant thank you enough for that. Ab aage ke liye apna dhyan rakhna aur khush rahna hamesha aur jaldi hi milte hai. ,Harshit  Garg,True,60a5fbd7819323d199d48898,Dewansh Kr. Singh
4,"Hi bro!!!! We have had so many memories together. The first that comes to my mind has to be codefundo. The trip to hyderabad was so fun with you and madhur. You did all the work and me, Madhur just tagged along. Besides it our constant harkate at dewansh room and both of us pulling his leg were so fun. Your nature is so good and damn you are very hardworking varna MTX thodi milta bro ko.(ab paise hi paise). Your fights with naman were so entertaining to watch that I never broke u too up.(sorry for that) But at the end you were a great friend and I hope we meet soon. Always be happy aur bhabhi milte hi batana zarur okay!!!!",Harshit  Garg,True,60a6136c819323d199d48a0c,Vishal  Agarwal
