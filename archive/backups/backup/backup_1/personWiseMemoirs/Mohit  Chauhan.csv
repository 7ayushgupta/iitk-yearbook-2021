I am sure ye to bas shuruat thi, abhi aage bahut chaapna bacha hai dost. Btw Friends dekh liya kya? :)",Mohit  Chauhan,True,60a64412819323d199d48d20,Aman  Gautam
1,"A good journey we have had from 'Bhai konsa course kare?' to 'Bhai kya laga'. CS ke courses se jo shuru hua tha, vo OEs pe khatam karte hue kafi fitting end lag raha hai. Compiler me jo tumne project me machaya tha, vo hamesha yad rahega :)",Mohit  Chauhan,True,60a6410c819323d199d48ce8,Ankit  Kumar
2,"Artist hai apna bhai. Always looking to learn new things. 12 hrs in room, 12 in RM or Library. I would probably come in your room and, after a stoll of 5 mins be on my way. Those idle conversations in those countless 5 mins I will aways remember. Looking forward to watching another movie with you, Predator me jab mile tab :)",Mohit  Chauhan,True,60a652ec819323d199d48e3f,Arshdeep  Kainth

Bhai always is ready and eager to help, I haven't been disappointed, be it booking tickets, or a difficult topic only he could explain :)  PSY451 ka revision kar rahe the jab last time mile the, maza aa raha tha bhai course me nahi? Ah, and the amount of food supply this guy brings is unparalleled. Yar, Amdavad ma sathe farya nathi, have eno plan banavo  :)",Mohit  Chauhan,True,60a64f29819323d199d48dfe,Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai
