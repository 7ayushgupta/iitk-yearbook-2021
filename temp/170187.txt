Somehow, you were the only one who knew the right things to say. I really wish hamare Delhi me milne ke plans ke beech me tera naam nahi aata XD I remember that whiteboard we drew of the whole web of interconnectedness we have and it was amazing, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Small world. You are someone who cares deeply, loves deeply and for me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing or that it\xe2\x80\x99s too much. Because without people like you, people like us, the world won\xe2\x80\x99t be a good enough place to live, so thanks for being that person. Thanks for being you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for the Lucknow thing and for just in general going out of the loop and being a bad friend. I really hope I\xe2\x80\x99ll do better when I\xe2\x80\x99m out of here. But I somehow feel that this bad habit of mine won\xe2\x80\x99t affect our friendship. Even if we talk after months, it\xe2\x80\x99s still the same and I love that. Also, ab group calls/games me aana start karde, bahut pitayi hogi nahi to. Huh, uncle hai tu poora. Anyway, milte hai jald.
