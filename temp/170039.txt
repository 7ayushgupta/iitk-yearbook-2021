Learned a lot of things from you since my first year, and you still inspire me to try to run after excellence and how to be an ideal student.  First year me there room me bulla kaatna, padhai ki baate krna, gaana gana, loco khelna, politics ki baate krna ye kaafi fond memories hain. Uske baad wing tootne ke baad interaction km ho gyi but still kaafi baate hoti rehti thi. To me you\'ll always be a person who is not at all startled by the success hi gets and pursues excellence and not success, cuz success excellence ke peeche jhak maarke aa jaati and you are an example of that.
