One of the purest soul of our wing. A guy who always wished good for others. You have always been there whenever I needed any help, be it in Udghosh Hospi or anything. Late-night discussions with you have always been fun. And even in this pandemic you always join the wing VCs irrespective of the time❤

Kaafi chill banda hai tu, humesha available to talk.

I will always remember you as the ""work hard and party hard"" guy. The way you stood up in F2 was legendary. First year me humesha doubts batane ko taiyar rehte the bro. And tumhari branch change ke baad Batti courses me kami lagi tumhari. 
I can never forget your birthday celebration at OAT and then dancing in the wing until seniors came to shut our party down. You have always been an interesting guy to talk to. 
Also thanks for the ""Paris Darshan"". Video call pe Eifel tower dikhaya :p Aaj bhi video call ka SS saved hai.
You have been the kind of guy who was always enthusiastic to hang out with the wing, and have always been the front runner in all the fun episodes. Be it EDMs or Holi Party you have always been there with the wing.

लाइफ में कुछ लोग होते हैं जो पूरे टाइम साथ होते हैं लेकिन उनके साथ मेमोरीज ज़्यादा नहीं होती और कुछ होते हैं जो कभी कभी मिलते हैं पर उनके साथ गुज़ारा हर पल यादो में बस जाता है।  
Over these four years, we might not have met a lot but I can definitely the memories made with you are some of the most cherished ones. 
The first year Saini was the most out-going and joking chhapri nibba, I had ever met. B6-C6 wali bonding, those Mini Militia games and teri harkate were all too fun. Your hairstyle and hair accessories were soo famous :p 
I still remember celebrating your birthday in the canteen during the first year winter break. Also that NSS painting drive when we were just sort of busy taking pictures :p
Second-year Saini was the most dedicated person that I saw. Your dedication towards Robo Club was amazing. I still remember that late-night discussion about Robo Club Marketing where you told me about your plans for the club. 
Third-year Saini was just so different, you gained so much maturity (though still a chhapri nibba :p) Third year Saini was ke saath sabse zyada maze kiye- be it sharing Techkriti BT or discussing our issues. Devendra-Piyush ke room pe aake bakchodi karna, pizza khana were all part of this fun. Btw the wall art in your room was just awesome bro.

Tere saath din-raat gossips, ghar ki stories, aur mazaks sabme bahut maze aate the. You are probably one of the very very few people who have seen me cry in college. You have been someone jisse sab khulke share kiya hai meine. Tere se life ke baare me bahut seekha mein. Tujhe shayad na pata ho but tere random gyans have helped me a lot to grow up. 
Tere saath PUBG khelna (Ping968 <3) was/is so much fun. Esp bcoz you are a pro gamer. Be it cards or any shooting game.

First year me tu Raghav ka roomie tha tab dekha tha tujhe bas utna hi interaction tha. Fir Gupta tereko Udghosh me laya tha..... And uske baad toh jo saath rahe hain hum log 💓

Udghosh ke kya hi din the bhai wo! Second year me hospi desk sambhalna subah subah, raat me pange handle karna aur din bhar bhagana... kya hi din the wo. Also, Fraudy Fest Team, kya hi, maze kiye the humne sabke saath me.

Uske baad Teckhriti bhi saath me sambhali apan ne (Although tu kisi aur ko sambhal rha tha fest me 😜) 
First year me room pe baithe rehne wala banda dekhte hi dekhte Fests ka Majdoor ban gaya. Koi bhi kaam ho, koi bhi situation ho sabko handle karne me expert. 

In sab ke beech me kab itne close aa gaye pata hi nhi laga. Poore summers saath me mess jaate the. And those late night walks and ice-creams would remain some of the best memories of my campus experience. 

Techkriti ko na jaane kis kis unchai tak le jaane ke khayal the apne!! Had the pandemic not struck, you'd have surely taken it to that level bro! TOSC me teri mehnat is exemplary.

Mere 90% daaru experience me tu included raha hai... Tere saath kitne hi maze kiye hain bhai parties me! I still remember Hidden Lounge wala experience... waha bhi tune hi sambhala tha hum teeno ko 😂

Poore lockdown me jitni baate ghar pe nahi ki usse zyada tum dono se ki hain 😂

Our Goa trip was sooooo awesome.... Thanks for handling me that night 🙃 Teri driving skills ka first-hand experience mil gaya waha pe. 

I am always worried about you bro kyunki I am pretty sure teri bail karwane toh hume hi aana padega 😛

Tere saath hone pe I know I can act all careless and befikr, because kuch bhi hoga tu handle kar lega and you'll be there to take cover my back.

My very first memory of you: On our very first GBM when DoSA asked all the students to leave if they were not comfortable and people started moving out, you were the one who asked us to keep sitting there. Although kafi fati hui thi fir bhi baith gaye the there saath.
This pandemic made our bond stronger, partly because during regular time you were almost never in your room :p 
I really enjoyed playing PUBG with you guys. That used to be one of the most entertaining things during early pandemic. Fir PUBG ban ke baad Psych, Among Us bhi try kiya tha. 😅
Also thanks for helping me out in CHM and MSE course. Tere bharose hi kiye wo courses. I never had to study in those bcoz I knew you were there to cover us. 
Also your advice to shout ""𝐾ℎ𝑎𝑐ℎ 𝐾ℎ𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟 𝐾ℎ𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟 𝐻𝑢 𝐻𝑎 𝐻𝑢 𝐻𝑎"" right before the start of interviews, really came handy. (I can't believe I am writing it, but it really brought down the anxiety levels xD)

Uske baad toh Satyam ke karan hua milna, cricket khelna aur DoAA me milna. Tu zyadatar time waise toh busy hi rehta tha SnT me.

Poore char saal me itne moments share kiye hain humne, jagah kam pad jayegi likhne me. Although I can just sum it up in one line also : ""Bhai hai tu""

First year me bagal ki hi wing me tha tu, but mile hum log Udghosh aur Pankaj ki kripa se. Fests ke naam pe aisa dosti hua jaise ek _________  (aage ka sentece apne aap bhar lena :p) 

Techkriti se leke Udghosh ki hospi saath me sambhalne me maze hi aa gaye the bhai. Although we hought we were working, but actually we were making memories. First year me Biswa ke show ke liye special entry, Teams ke saath liye hue pange sab kaafi memorable rahe hain. We were never trying to learn about fests but itne zyada involved ho gaye ki har cell ki baat aur kaam pata hota tha. 

First year me Pankaj-Rajat ke room pe bakchodi karna, chhat pe jaake baate karna, random discussions, Techkriti me bulla session, <censored> sab fav memories me se hain. Ek bar Fest ke kaam ke beech tereko chaabi di thi ki room se saman le aaye tu mere, 10 in baad tu tuti hui chaabi leke aata hai 😂

Our late night walks were so epic... Bas ek round aur karte karte na jane kitne chakkar laga liye. Aur uske baad ice cream bhi saara fat wapas gain karne ke liye.

Second year summers me kaafi maze kiye apan ne, be it jenga khelna, fest ki planning karna, Devnedra ke maze lena, tera deodrant waste karna, tere room pe harkate karna sab kaafi mazedar the. OAT pe tera bday celebrate karna aur fir teri GPL kya hi maze aaye the bhai.

Saath me Hidden Lounge jana (bina bag/bottle ke 😂) would always remain the funniest trip ever. Also tere bina ek bhi daaru party nahi ki hai meine. Mere har daaru experience ka hissa raha hai tu. 

And thanks to you, Goa was awesome! Thanks for all those scooty rides :p But bc teri capacity kam ho gayi hai ab.

All our discussion calls are so much fun, let's hope we keep them up even with our jobs.
Tere se ek shikayat humesha rahegi ki tu cheeze batata nhi hai. But I know I can never be upset/angry/frustrated with you because even if you don't tell me, you'll always be there to take care of things for me and will always be there to cover my back.

PS: You'll go places bro! Tere level ka dedication self-improvement ka maine shayad hi kisi me dekha ho. Tera 'No fucks' attitude is amazing bhai... 5 courses me fakke ke baad Day 1 placement, 7 CPI se graduate shayad hi koi kar paye.

Kya haal chaal? I can't believe this is the same Sireesha that I am writing the memoir for, that I met in 2nd year. We first met for the Udghosh interviews. Poore Udghosh me you were the sincere and innocent one. Never knew kab tum humare group ka hissa ban gayi. Udghosh ke time toh kaam ki hi baaten ki humne. Fir uske baad interaction start hua jab saath me padhne library jaate the. 

Raat bhar Library/NCL me padhna aur fir DoAA me chai is one of my favourite memories. Raat me padhne ke baad long walks, discussing about our future plans, politics, and random stories me kitna maza aata tha. Monika aur Bhupi ke saath academic area me kitne hi ghanto time pass kiya hai humne. MABS is a very special part of my college journey. Too many chais involved. Hum sabka raat me walk karna aur canteen se Lala Maggi laake HC ke saamne baith ke khaana. Kitne fun times the. Also Hall 4 aur Hall 10 ki canteen jaake ghas pe baithke khaana. 

Devendra, Piyush ke saath movie dekhne jana bahar khaana khaane jaana sab kitne bhadiya times the. Upar se tumhara mere room pe aake padhna kyunki apne room me man nhi lagta tha tumhara. 
I hope ab Birayani aur Chicken ke alawa bhi kuch khaati ho. Kabhi mile toh badminton khelte, jaise OAT road pe khelte the.  

Kitni saari fun memories hain saath me hum sabki: Room pe poker khelna, Monika ko station pe drop krne jaana, raat me paaglo ki tarah ghumna, sis wale uncle ke saath baith ke aag sekna, DoAA ki maggie, Hall 12 ki biryani,  OAT rooftop pe raat me baithke gappe ladana sabke saath, Lockdown me sabke saath video calls aur Ludo khelna. 

Also, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you about the incident when you called that doctor ""khadoos"". Epic scene tha yaar 😂😂
Tumhare injection ke dar ko toh sab jaante hi hain, I still get chills remembering the first time I took you for blood test. Itne bade bade aasnsu 😂

But truly tumhara transformation dekh ke bahut khushi hoti hai, from a girl struggling with acads and no outside interaction, you transformed yourself into a bold and independent person. I hope aage bhi aise hi khud ko strong banye rakho aur khud ko improve karte raho. Milte hain kabhi Hyderabad me.

Our PUBG and Valorant sessions have been legendary. Ping968 ka Miramar match kabhi nhi bhul sakta hu.

First-year me star gazing to third-year me next-door-roomie, it has been a truly amazing bonding, at least for me. From canteen trips to mess trips, from discussing politics to life experiences, from participating in treasure hunts to pubg rank push, from waking up for breakfast to late-night skribble games, it has been really fun times. 

Cheers to many more memories and amazing friendship! Looking forward to more trips in future with you boi.",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a646ed819323d199d48d63,Umang  Malik
