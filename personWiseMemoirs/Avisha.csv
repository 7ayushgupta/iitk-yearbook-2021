Man, you are one of a kind. I have never met a person like you before. You are always fun to talk to, and I am always amused by the time conversation ends. 
Your graph at IITK has been quite a spectacle to watch. I always loved teasing you with inappropriate questions. Your dedication and work ethics are great, and I hope you never lose your zeal to learn and grow.

3,"I remember the first time we talked, and we ended up discussing things for the whole night. I instantly clicked with you and related on so many levels. And then began the never-ending gossiping, bitching, ranting and sharing. 
It was almost a ritual to periodically catch up with you on a walk or at dinner and discuss everyone and everything. I remember once we went to the faculty building to find you-know-who, only to be disappointed later. 
I still remember when I was sitting alone at Kanpur central railway station, and I was going through something at the time. The only person I could think of texting who would understand me without saying much was you. Even though we talked after a long period of a void between us, you listened to me and understood me immediately.
I am fortunate to find someone with whom I can share so much about myself, my relationships, my problems, my crazy dreams and my opinions without worrying about judgement. 
We had our fair share of times where we drifted apart. I remember feeling very sad because of almost losing you as a friend, but I am glad we survived that stage. It’s rare to find such trustworthy friends like you in people. While I was not there with you at every step of the journey, you always had my support and cheer. 
You had a remarkable journey here, very unique to you. The strength and courage with which you stood up for the things and people you care about are commendable. There were, of course, lows and hiccups, but I have seen you pull through at the end always.  
Thanks for entertaining me, being there for me, listening to me and being patient with me. 
Love you <33

5,"Oh man, oh man *insert tatti emoji*,
I feel like it won't be just if I start this memoir with all the adjectives I have for you. 
I wonder what I can do about this? 
.
Discord bot: Akshay is a gem of a person and one of a kind. He is usually found in CCD drawing Rick on paper napkins or painting hall five walls, or just being creative wherever he goes. He is also unusually enthusiastic and never fails to help his friends. 
.
Well, the bot couldn't capture my relationship with Akshay and just stated some of his habits. So it doesn't even begin to capture my relationship with him. 
I can consult his personal favourites. I should get creative like him and draw something to impress him. 
.
Sketch pen - *draws something half-assed and can not match Akshay's creative skills* 
.
Akshay, I know, never creates art to impress anybody, and I shouldn't too. 
.
Knife - I think his true strength lies in his creative ideas and F1 car racing (yeah, those babies are damm cool). 
.
Well, those weren't of any help to me in describing our relationship to you. Yes, you. I am talking to you now. All those knives, paintbrushes, sketch pens, and other creative tools which catch your attention are exceptional in their ways. For you, have the power to use them and create something beautiful. 
And I am grateful to not only get that attention but so much more from you over these years. I felt special every time you thought about me, every time you created something new for me, every time you pinged me to discuss something, every time you called me to gossip, every time you took my suggestion to read or watch something, every time you planned my birthday, every time you supported me and cheered me. 
All these things you do that I can not thank you enough for have made me feel very special and loved.
But let me tell a thing or two to that stupid bot. You are so much more than this to me. You are a calm breeze in the storm of the hustle-bustle of everything. I would still send you shit emojis and tell you my secrets even if you don't paint my face on freakin' Mt. Fuji for my birthday. Nothing is more important to me than your friendship, and everything is just a bonus that god made up for the pandemic he gave us. 
You are a very important person in my life whom I wouldn't let go of even if Curran asked me to while giving his alpha stare. 

Love you <3",Avisha,True,60ce5e6f659165b3aa64647c,Akshay

7,"How do I start talking about you or even about us?
My constant from A602 -> B206 -> D block!
I think nobody else on campus saw me the way you saw me. The same goes the other way, too, I believe. We had seen each other during the worst of our days when nothing in life was going right, or we just had a bad hair day on top of big dark circles. You have seen me laughing, crying, scared, nervous, anxious, sad, hungry, drunk, high, even horny xD and every other shade of me that existed at IITK. 
Your cute messages for me in the mirror or on my door always surprised me and made me feel very special. I often remember waking up to a clean bed with my laptop kept adequately on the table when I accidentally slept around all the mess while working the previous night. The little things that you did to care for me never went unnoticed and only made me feel more and more grateful to you. I can not thank you enough for kicking me out of my room that morning and bully me into making that confession.
Over the four years, you have changed enormously. From being the non-confrontational person to handling big student teams and being vocal about things you care about, you have come a long way. I had the pleasure of watching you achieve all this tenaciously. I am nothing but proud of all that you are, and I love you with all your idiosyncrasies. 
I know I have never been that affectionate person who can hug you very quickly if you are sad, but I always had your back with all my power and love for you. 

There is nobody else to whom I would want to change and show my million outfits before picking the one I chose the first time. 
There is nobody else for whom I would quickly come up with excuses to get them out of tiresome situations. 
There is nobody else for whom I would go an extra mile to wake them up without getting them cranky :P
There is nobody else I would hug for that long, and there is nobody else whose facial expressions would speak to me as yours do.
We have shared rooms and silences. Those blessed moments with you in silence when we would just sit and enjoy each other’s company while working or scrolling on the phone were my best times at IITK.
I love you so much and will always miss you being just next to me <333",Avisha,True,60cf35ee659165b3aa6465ba,Ananya  Goswami

Man, you had an exciting graph over the years. I remember we first had a good talk during Y18's treasure hunt. It was a very candid conversation and filled with wisdom on how to open Kurkure packets properly. You sure learned it well :P 
Our occasional catch-ups and meals used to be a refreshing change from usual circles and mundane routines. I will never forget the Feni tasting event bash in my room. I sure did get a lot of kicks from watching you kicking in the air. 
I will miss having drunk conversations with you in fests and our random discussions of Riptide in CCD. Thanks for introducing me to that song btw.

10,"To,
My last kiss,

Okay, bro, let's clarify that your dresses are safe only because they are not my size. I absolutely love your style :P
I remember I was so excited to hang out with you after listening about you from so many people before. The first time we met, we clicked immediately, almost stripped and danced so much. Then we shifted in the same wing where I would see you every day walking in your popular I-need-to-get-things-done-today style.   
Every conversation which starts with your story has to make me roll on the floor or amuse me beyond anything. Your storytelling skills are no joke, and you should be more proud of them. 
I loved watching you make decisions. It's weird to say, but it's fun when you get confused or try to calm yourself or just decide 'yeh to nahi horaha hai'. The quickest I have seen you come to a decision was when we got the mail to return, and you decided we are having a party right now no matter what. 
Whenever I think about the Goa trip, I go back to those scooty rides under the stars with a bit of chill in the air. That last day of the trip was crazy for different reasons xD but the one thing I never told you about that day was how much I admired you trying to save me from the 'oh he loves you' conversation. You are so perceptive of your surroundings and can read the room very quickly. I loved how sometimes our eyes met, and we just knew what was happening or what to do next.
Lastly, I wish more power to you. Keep trusting your instincts, and don't doubt your decisions. You have the strength to back them up constantly. Also, I know it's futile to say don't overthink (easier said than done) so, overthink in the company of your choice, aka people who make you comfortable!
I am going to miss you a lot!
Love you so much <3

15,"Hey / Yo/ Hi/ Hallo,
Now keep wondering if anything is wrong with my mood xD. 
You don't get a proper greeting because remember you ignored my hellos multiple times in PE and didn't even accept it.
How can I describe our friendship and provide an accurate account of our memories because they are countless? I am going for the things left unsaid version here because there are many things that I have never said before, and I will dive straight into it. 
You know me, I like saying things as straightforward as they can be, but you have a way with words. 
You like doing things a certain way which is usually magnificent. I respect that about you. You have a clear vision in mind, and you relentlessly push yourself to make it come true. Sometimes people fail to see your vision, but it doesn't matter because you always come through in the end.
You are a keeper. Everything about you speaks of it. You love making everything around you beautiful, whether it's your room or your relationships. I have no doubts that where ever you go, you will make the place and people your very own.
Your instincts are always so spot on. You follow them in the most natural ways. 
I know we had our fair share of tough times when we misunderstood each other and hurt each other. But, know that the people who care about each other the most hurt each other the most. Of course, that's not an excuse, but I hope you know it all never came from a bad place. 
Talking to your day and night became the routine, and I didn't realise when we started sharing so much about ourselves. I opened up about my insecurities, weaknesses, and weird thoughts to you so quickly. I didn't hold back from telling you my weird habits, silly questions, and even saying gibberish stuff to make you go jeez (damm, that was quite a phase :P).
I remember how we used to have silly fights and leg-pulling about the most random stuff. ""Yeh kachra hai"" or ""kachra kardiya"" I loved getting those reactions out of you. 
Nobody can replace you in my life and what you have been to me. Your kindness, politeness and all the lame adjectives can go out the window now. You are just A-you-sh and A-them-sh (yes, this will haunt you forever xD).
Thanks for always being there for me, standing up for me, cheering for me, supporting me in ways I would never know and just being my friend who hates dogs as much as me.
Love you <33

Crazy cycle rides, beer-sneak incident, midnight mosquito reproduction lectures, and rolling at Nicki Minaj’s music videos, to list a few.

All those times, I wondered how strong and courageous you are. Your fierce determination to grow and reach new heights is astounding. I am so grateful to be the friend you trusted to open up to and the friend you stood up for many times.

The more I hung out with you closer we came. The constant every-year photoshoots, marvel movies, Xoomba outings, late night walks and so many memories which I can’t list down here not because they are countless but because I will cry.

*playing Angel of Death by Manchester Orchestra in the background*

Imagine sitting in a magnificent library full of books you like and would like if you read them. Yet, every time you pick a book, a different one falls off the shelf.
Initially, you pick up the book but don’t know where it fell off from. You try to locate its position but fail to do so and keep it aside. Next, you try reading the book you previously picked up instead of continuing the search. This unlocks the curse of the library on you. If you don’t finish this book within a specific time, all the books will fall off on you. You are rushing with adrenaline and quickly finishing up the book while enjoying it at the same time. But the time ran out, and another one fell off. You can’t locate its position again, and the cycle continues. 
Slowly you start enjoying the puzzle and understand the mystery of falling off the books. You pick up the last book you read and place it in its correct position. Finally, you break out of the curse, and all the books go back to their original positions. 

Every memory I have of talking to you is like me in this library. The questions, arguments, opinions, secrets come down on me like those books, and I love that thrill of going through them before a new one comes. It all comes together every time, and I think that your voice is the real curse of the library because sometimes it can use my company. 

I can never write a befitting description of memories of those experiences, but I can only tempt you with the idea of an extensive library and lots of books.
From wassup to patli gali se nikal we haven’t explored even half of that library. So I would like to build a section there especially for books with names for your future theorems and all kinds of emoxymorons.

You probably like the sound of your voice too much xD, and that’s why you ask so many questions.
Questions that sometimes leave me clueless, compel me to think hard, drive me crazy while answering them, or bring me closer to myself and you. 

People might have told you; you make it easy to talk to you. I think they never got to the point when the conversation peaks and it becomes difficult not to keep talking to you. I would like a constant supply of that for me very much. 
You challenge me every time we talk. Your words challenge my ideas. Your questions challenge my arguments. Your arguments challenge my notions of rationality.
That’s the spirit with which you charge into conversations, and that’s what I love about our unfiltered exchanges. When we first decided to go unfiltered, I didn’t imagine I signed up for all the shades of unfiltered we painted over every canvas of a topic possible. 

Know that I never have and will never give up on you and your questions. So come at me with all that you have because I won’t hold back from taking the pains of arguing, discussing, explaining, learning, considering, convincing and getting convinced. 

*now playing Jambi by TOOL in the background*

Memories. What are they really?
Were they the times we spend together or the time I spent thinking about you and laughed counts too?
Were they the times when we debated relentlessly for hours, or would the time I looked forward to discussing something with you count too?
Were they the times we spent sharing songs or the time I listened to those songs on repeat counts too?
Do the times we drifted apart, but I thought about you, discussed you and missed you count too?
Does time when I pushed hard after being inspired by you, counts too?
Were they the times we discussed the meaning of happiness or the nights we walked and walked happily?

It would be an understatement that you have grown a lot over these years. But, what never changed was your place in my life. Of course, we had our fair share of silences too. The time when we drifted apart, probably for good, was when I realised your importance in my life. 
It struck me you are gentle when you try to calm my conscious down; you keep your judgements aside when you listen to me; you like me even on the days I don’t like myself.

You have my heart, and I will miss you every time I walk around in libraries <3

I didn’t know how to write a memoir for you. So let’s go on a Promenade, shall we?
Firstly we can hit CCD and check if others are there. Then we can go rooftop hopping, and finally, let’s stroll on the streets.

It has been amazing to watch you grow into a compassionate and mature person over the years. 

Love you <3",Avisha,False,60ce80ea659165b3aa6464a2,Pragya  Patel

38,"Prathammmmm, we get another year of ranting and bitching at CCD! 
Our random walks starting and ending at CCD were always super fun. I think I don't have any other friends with whom I have traveled so much. We have shared some of the most incredible memories in Taiwan together. Thanks for your support there and also for washing off the utensils :P 
I have greatly admired your dedication and persistence to learn new things and deal with boomer professors xD.
Looking forward to meeting you soon!

39,"Here I was thinking to surprise you by reminding you about the first time we met in your memoir. Well, things don't always go to plan, just like those interviews xD. I remember it didn't take me much time to be comfortable around you. You are kind and make it easy to talk to you. I had a lot of fun with you during the CGS course, where we totally copied our way out. The camaraderie, panicking together till the last minute, hurriedly figuring out our codes, and then framing our defenses when we almost got caught xD, were the most fun times of that semester. 
You always gave a fun and kind vibe. Thanks for all the cheerful times!!",Avisha,True,60ae451c659165b3aa644e2a,Priank  Prasad
40,"*starting the memoir with one of my many laments starting with Priyaa or Sun na*
People might find your bio quite apt, but I can't agree with the phrase 'plain awkward' at all. You have such an eclectic mix of awkward moments, all of which can't be described here, but I am going with my favourite one. 
""I have decided I won't have labs on Mondays"" — that painfully awkward moment when you realise your lab is, in fact, on Mondays.

People always asked me how are you and I, such good friends, despite having supposedly opposite personalities? This question always brought a big smile to my face imagining how I would tell you about this later. 
It was always so simple with us. If I am hungry, you will accompany me to the canteen, simple. And, if I don't like someone, you will talk about throwing them out of the window for eternity but never do it, again simple xD. 
You are my best high companion, horse riding partner, favourite coffee date, and undoubtedly the first and last person to do Titanic pose with me :D

EE would unmistakably kill me in your absence. So thanks for saving my life there and also from crazy campus dogs.
Our relationship was mostly taking turns to handle and pamper each other. Whether it was cooking up conspiracy theories, daydreaming about fancy vacations, wishful thinking about EE courses getting cancelled, motivating each other to stay awake till breakfast after a night out, or any ordinary day at IITK with you, it was all worth it.
We have come a long way from that stapler to our T-spanner, lonely Vodka to shared coffees and formal hellos to teary goodbyes, and now there is no right way to end this sentence because our journey doesn't end here.

Since this was going to be things left unsaid version so here it comes —
Your loyalty towards friends is commendable. You indeed are a force of nature in providing your friends unconditional faith and support (also when a lizard manages to enter your room xD). 

I am fortunate I had the liberty, comfort and sheer thrill of unleashing my authentic self in front of someone during these four years. The amount of shit I have unloaded on you is enormous, but still somehow less than the time you take to style your hair (this, of course, needed a mention here :P). 
It was cathartic to come to your room after a long day and just rant while finishing your food. Just talking to you made me feel better.

Also, I can not emphasise the importance of your words to me enough. It means a lot when you give me your honest opinions and never hold back while cheering me up. 
You calling me Avisaaa has always stopped me in my tracks. It always pulled me out of detached-from-reality breakdowns or distracting moments. 
""One step at a time"" — I will always carry these words with me; they always had a calming effect on me in the worst of times. 
It's scary that just these words will always hold such power over me, but it's even scarier that now you won't always be there to say them in person to me. 

You have my heart

42,"Let me begin by quoting our friend Peter Porker- 'How dare you fucking say pleasure?' 
It's funny how our friendship originated from Facebook comments. Knowing you and your humor has been great for me. You have a humble presence which makes it very easy to approach you, even from other people's phones xD.",Avisha,True,60a68669819323d199d490b1,Pulkit  Pandey
43,"Yoo
Man, we had crazy fun times in the first year. I have some of my best college memories with you. I particularly remember how you came through and handled everything so maturely during that unfortunate blue world incident. Also, thanks for constantly clicking our awesome pictures (sorry about all the credits tho xD), bearing with our childish ways of having fun and being a part of my journey!
You are a very kind person. I admire your poise and calm demeanour. People see you as a very reliable and trustworthy friend, and it's undoubtedly true. 
Let revisit Blue World sometime in future only with no head damages this time :P

I remember we first met in Phy lab. I wonder how would I have ever finished my experiments if you wouldn't have come and bestowed us with your wisdom. 
Thanks for keeping me alive with your humour and even darker humour during bad and good times. 
It was lovely talking to you, bitching with you and ranting with you!

48,"I remember the first time we talked was when you suddenly came up to me asking for a picture together on the fresher's night. You were always very straightforward and easy to talk to. I think we were destined to embarrass ourselves since the day we opted for the fashion show. But, it was a little less embarrassing with you people around me. Although we haven't been in touch lately, I cherish our time together in the first year (exchanging waves on messenger :P).",Avisha,True,60a685af819323d199d490ac,Shivam  Arya

Seriously we've somehow got to stop this man xD.
You have always been a great company, be it in anime marathons, CCD hangouts, Vox meetings and definitely on birthday eves!
I still can't understand your weird choice of winter accessories in friggin' January. But, I think only you can pull off leather gloves paired with shorts in winters. You are very outgoing and always up for crazy fun. I admire your last-minute-mar-marke-kardunga wala cool!
Had a great time with you and looking forward to more this year!!

50,"Hey buddy,
 We definitely had an interesting first encounter. The one where I was supposed to propose to you and make you awkward. I am glad I never did that prank, and we just remember our first encounter as something potentially weird! 
 I admire your perseverance and firm belief in yourself. These qualities reflected in all your endeavours and made you stand out. You don’t easily get swayed by public opinions, and that is why conversations with you have always been engaging and fun for me. 
 I mostly skipped German classes, but the ones I attended were quite fun with you around. Our practical memories are damm crazy with all the shitting-our-pants fun of practising German and enacting their scenes. 
 You were my true CCD constant punctuated with occasional walks and detours xD. I wish we could have hung out more, but you never left your soulmate, aka PK Kelkar Library :P

52,"I have a plan to make us rich. Let's ask Priya to give us a coin (or dollar soon xD) every time she claims to throw someone out of the window. 

I am always so excited to share my creep stories with you, only to see you do that eye roll and throw some witty punchlines. Your iconic eye roll is my favourite accessory on you. Also, you are a real sport when it comes to dares, and your genius is 100 when you are drunk xD.
Now before I jump on the bandwagon of sharing our notable memories here, I would go for the things left unsaid version first— 

Your strong sense of individuality amazed me since the beginning. It is, of course, not hidden that you are crazy talented and definitely staying true to your almost real name Madam Curie (this should also not be hidden anymore :P).
But, what I truly admire about you is your respect for your body, mind and time. Being in your presence meant getting inspired to be an unapologetic version of myself. Also, as a spectator and an honorary member of the music club, may I say you were the best cordi the club had ever seen. Everything about you speaks of strength and resilience.

In the last few months, I got a chance to see how Swadha does friendships. It was cathartic to relate with you on so many levels about our 'female' student experiences. I didn't realise when our relationship became more than just relatable experiences but about caring and protecting each other. It was a spectacular feat that we met pretty late but still managed to rip off the bandages of awkwardness quickly and opened up. Thanks for teaching me how to say no to people. 

I will miss calling you to rescue me from dogs, eating cold pizzas with you, talking about our crazy grandmas, bitching about creeps and of course, stealing your coffee. Wow, my midnight snacking practically depended on you.
Everything about you is exceptional, your walk, jokes, 'gossip bata na koi', and unique ways to show that you care. 
Love you <333

53,"Yo,
We had joyous times in the first year! Your blue world dive incident is definitely among my top three college heart-attack moments. I wished after that dive somebody would come to us and say, ""Look, there is the camera, you have been bamboozled"", but instead, we rushed to the hospital. 
Gladly things turned out well, and we are all healthy and now. Thanks for the bravado and courage you showed that day xD.

54,"Yo,
Although we lost touch after the first year, we managed to make quite fun memories together. 
I still remember the day I drew on your while you were asleep and let you walk outside like that xD. Remember that one time we went shopping for something 'special' and ended up buying cheap chappals and churans :P
You are always part of happening things, and I loved talking to you in ESO tutorials. 
Thanks for the fun times and all the best!

You are so energetic and yet calm in the face of trouble. You made Freshers night super fun and totally rocked in the cosplay too. Your laugh really fills a room with joy. I will never forget your Ben 10 bag, CCD pole dance, dandiya night dance, and, of course, your ligma balls joke phase.
I distinctly remember this particular memory of ours. You gave me a very spectacular cycle ride, like in the foyer, during which we laughed so much. Those were genuinely fun times.
I am glad we became friends and thankful that you were a great one to me.

We had fun times together in the first year and subsequent Eid parties. I totally love your collection of kurtas :P 
I still remember that mail from you to all the group members after some heavy-ass recruiting xD. I will read that mail a few years down the line and have an excellent trip to memory lane. Hoping to catch up someday on Eid back at Faizan's place, still making mandir jokes and playing Pictionary!

58,"To,
My last April-fool (not so much a fool xD)

I remember first we became fest friends and use to catch up every fest. The first time we had a real conversation was when we bonded on rooftops, and you were actually on a rooftop at the time :P
We have countless memories with each, so here I am going for things left unsaid version— 
We always clicked very well and had the most level-headed discussions. Your thoughts about people, society and life, resonated well with me, and that’s why constructing new ideas with you was always very satisfying.
Your tenacity and willpower never fail to surprise me. But what doesn’t surprise me is your warmth and compassion. You respect people and their time. You never take people for granted, and that’s admirable. 
I always envied how you managed your time and brought yourself to commit to things without fail. 
I hope one day, when we jinx for the millionth time, we pick up the same book to read over the week and then discuss it over the call later. 
Meanwhile, let’s learn to divide numbers by seven and not fuck up royally by matching our wrong answers. 

Love you <3
Your well-wisher
