You are one of the most hard-working, ambitious, focused person I know at IITK. I have always felt inspired and motivated by you. You are truly a great friend and the first Y17 I talked to :p. All the very best for your bright journey (also to Arsenal 😉. ), no doubt you will do something great.

1,"I guess we don't need to tell anyone at the campus about how great our friendship is and MAC. Movies, all-nighters, ghumna, ganna, basanti chillana, video banana, and kuch naya try karte raha.. everything is so special.
Masti to age continue rahne h wali hai.. but I think with a part of a song, you can feel how special you are as a friend to me.

""Dil Chahta Hai Kabhi Na Beete Chamkile Din
Dil Chahta Hai Hum Na Rahey Kabhi Yaaro Ke Bin
Din Din Bhar Ho Pyari Battein, Jhumein Shaamein, Gaaye Raatein
Masti Mein Rahey Duba Duba Hamesha Samaa
Humko Rahon Mein Yuhi Milti Rahey Khushiyan
Dil Chahta Hai Kabhi Na Beete Chamkile Din
Dil Chahta Hai Hum Na Rahey Kabhi Yaaro Ke Bin""

I know you will have a great future. All the very best!!!!

2,"Yooo rooomiee!!!!!
I feel very lucky that I shared my room with you. (btw.. do logo k vajah se compromise karna padha tha.. mene nikala nhi 😕). But what a first year I had.. and for that, a very special thanks to you. I still remember the first dinner we had together, and  we both sat in front of Mayank and all other 4th years.. meri to band baji this :p

You are truly very passionate, hardworking and cool. I'm sure you are going to have a great life. All the very best for future... I'm going to miss the time we spent. Plan thoda adhura rah gaya tha apna room decorate karne ka.. but I have learnt so much from you. Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Aditya  Sharma,True,60a68cca819323d199d490d3,Rushabh  Gandhi
3,"Hi dude!!
You are the most sporty, foody, cool, and chill person I have met at the campus. I feel so fortunate that I got a chance to be a friend of yours. Because of you, Rishabh, and Manish I feel so great that I was a HEC. I guess jo bhi tujhe janta hoga wo tere humar aur sarcasm ka fan hoga.. Mene to bhot sunne hai  :p aur jab bhi yaad karta un memories ko to smile aa jati hai. Thankyou very much for being a great friend and I don't need to say this, but best of luck, I believe you will do awesome things in future.",Aditya  Sharma,True,60a6226f819323d199d48afa,Jitesh  Soni
4,"Hello buddy!!
I remember meeting you for the first time during Galaxy 18'.. I decided that time to not participate in it eventually did. But feel so fortunate that I participated. Kafi cool dost mile.. and one of them is you. You are in many of the funniest and awesome memories I had at the campus. I will always be very grateful that I found a friend like you. 
And bhot bada sa thankyou mujhe khub hasane k liye... there are only a few people with whom I feel free, cool, fun and relaxed, and you will always be among them. A very very good luck with your career. I believe you will do great things in future.",Aditya  Sharma,True,60a61e79819323d199d48ac3,Kumar Ashish Raj
5,"Hello bro!!!!!!!
Though we didn't have spent a long time with each other, especially after the first year. But really had an amazing time with you. I remember I asked an ex-hec that we want to skip a Taknik event to go to hall 13 and then we went out, fortunately, with Rushabh to Hall 13, laughing and enjoying throughout the route. That time of E-summit we three spent together was amazing. And obviously lawn tennis. You are really a very nice, enthusiastic, visionary person. Also a great writer. I feel so great that I got to know you. All the very very best for your future. I'm sure you will do amazing things.",Aditya  Sharma,True,60a63354819323d199d48bee,Modi Arjav Himanshubhai
6,"Helloooo broo!!!!!
I still feel those memories very fresh when me, you & Dev spent time while working on Assignments in the second year. Hard to believe that we have completed our 4th year. That time was amazing. I never would have started the assignments after the deadline but with you guys (chemical eng. bros of E-bot :p) everything was very fun-filled. 
I'm glad that we became good friends. I have always received help from you whenever I asked and learnt some very important things from the discussions with you. A big thanks for that. 
You are a sincere, honest, and hardworking person.. ese h rahna. You deserve to have great things in your life. All the very best for the future. ",Aditya  Sharma,False,60aaaaeb659165b3aa644d54,Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh
7,"Hellllooooo buddy!!!!!!!
Woahhh, Yahooo, coooool, aweeessooome, greaaat, aur bhi similar words for you will be less to describe how an amazing human you are. Never saw you in any tension, always chill and relaxed. You deserve all great things in your life. I am so grateful that you are my friend.  It is very difficult to pick one or two best memories I have with you because every memory feels is so great.
I hope aap se age bhi knowledge milta rahe :p
