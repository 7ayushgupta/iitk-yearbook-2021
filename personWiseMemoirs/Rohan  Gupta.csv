No ok I will go with the limited time I have. Man I can never forget the trio we had you, me and Shrey. Also kuldeep consider yourself added too now haha. But what amazing it has been knowing you. Also you have a nice sense of humor 
👌 
It was so great reconnecting when we returned back to college. Also have spent countless hours roaming together in our 1st year. And we shall always be photo club bros! Bhai kitni saari cheezen ki hain saath mein and sadly I'm forgetting too! I just refound some photos we had clicked together - wo multiple abhishek 1 pic - us din wali. Also, you will always be the the Russian Chick Mag for me now huihui. Wish we could get more time, but it goes the way it does. I just want to  revisit memories, but let's do that on a trip!

1,"Yo Ojha,
I don't know how to go about this! You have a solid personality man. As I've said before you definitely were the pioneer of our wing. Last sem was noice, had much fun (**** and ******). Also the sem before that (o-r-g-chm+poker). And the one before - cricket man! And we go way further, Tenniss. I hope you liked the exercises I lead 😇 haha. Awesome times, I hope they haven't run out.",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cfaff8659165b3aa646914,Anirudh Anil Ojha
2,"Yo Digu,
I dig ur style,
It did not even take while,
To be cool friends,
Yes, I take ur offer, let this not end,
Dude u rhyme well,
But nobody can ever beat my song spell.
Hui.
Yo man it was really cool getting to know you, and man the cricket and karoke and hangouts and shh and more shh was so fun! Let's keep in touch!

3,"You won't know but damn I used to thing u were way too pro admi and was scared of u back then. Met you at opj, and interiit and bj ka room, but think actually started to know you in 6th sem - when we used to play cricket and you would come to meet bj. Crazy no, how we became friends in the online sem. Also damn man we have a lot of things in common. And oh, plag buddies, altho u have more experience haha. I am sure you bowl well, but I shall bowl better. Let's have a showdown aye. Also man, really cool person you are, and more importantly let's keep talking!",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cfaca8659165b3aa646913,Baldip Singh Bijlani
4,"Hi fren. Man I just remember 1st year, sharing the same batch and doing all courses and everything together! And fir debsoc bhi (wow 3 events together), cs201 in 3rd sem (I was actually happy ki we still had a common course, cuz like fir no scope next). Kaafi maze kiye hain yaar. And fir sadly interaction went low, my bad. I am just remembering yorking you in 6th sem. That is a good memory (^-^). On this note 7th sem bhi sahi tha mast organic chemistry, and some poker (at which I became pro). Oh shit, we've played cod too, nice! Again sorry for the short memoir, limited by compute rn (Ｔ▽Ｔ) Ok ab mereko mafia bhi yaad aa raha - u were pro i concede",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cf8e8e659165b3aa64689f,Bhavjeet  Singh

6,"Yo brooo!
Feeling grateful ki TA mein tumhare saath kaam kiya nahi to best project nahi milta lol - yaar sahi tha kd par baith ke autocad bana rahe hote the haha. Yaar it awesome knowing you, achi baat hai ki eco and ark verma ki wajah se baat hoti rahi xd. Hope to keep in touch and maybe meet too (whenever time dictates ab to)!",Rohan  Gupta,False,60cfbd58659165b3aa646924,Harsh  Agarwal
7,"Bhai tumhare liye to ek memoir nahi likha jaayga. Itne saare events hue tumhare saath ki I've lost count lol. Earliest memory is Shrey ko esc padhana and uske zada aa gaye loooool. Fir to Hovercraft bhi jeete the! And, ""me as well don't know who you are"" bhai ye nahi bhulega mujhe kabhi. 17k :p. yAaar ye sab bakchodiyan kahan chali gayin thi aage jaake. Main hi shayad alag ho gaya tha wing se. Memoir in progress to tumne likha complete main kar raha hun ye nahi chalega. Are and we also had the trip to lucknow, ghar bhi aaye the sab, how can I forget! The summer project, ghiste the har roz and fir wire se mast katna thermacol. Kitne bachpan ke din lag rahe yaar. I am happy ki fir se milne ka mauka mila hamen! Iski value aaj fir realize kar raha. Hope to see you soon. ",Rohan  Gupta,False,60cf9af7659165b3aa6468f3,Kuldeep  Singh
8,"Hey bro! It was so nice knowing you. 1st years summers saath mein ghise hain dono aero and fir dono bhaag gaye the lol. The Lucknow trip I will always remember, a fond memory. It is 3 years now to that trip! I wish we could meet and have fun again! All the best for your future bro, and let's hope to meet again sometime.",Rohan  Gupta,False,60cfa901659165b3aa64690e,Kunal  Sharma
9,"Hey Dweepak, I cannot let slide not writing a memoir for uu. 3 years of knowing you and has been amazing. Surprisingly we were neighbors in 1st year but didn't get to know each other much. Then it's been like woah! Partnered up in cs202, and that continued for each and every course (except cs251 sorey). But damn this is amazing. I never could appreciate that it's so looong. You have been an awesome friend (tackling the weight of emotional breakdowns of so many damn, including me). Man so many random times we've spent, I wish we could get more (at least the full share of last year). It is a small memoir, hardly does justice, I know, but make do till we meet again!",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cf8c56659165b3aa646890,Mahajan Dipak Anil
10,"Yo Nitesh!
It was great knowing you in the first year summers! Aero club pe mav banate rehna and coordies ki dant sunna (and wow then u went on to become one). Fir lko ghumna - wo trip kaafi mast thi! Sorry I could not keep in touch but let us ab se!",Rohan  Gupta,False,60cfb5d8659165b3aa64691a,Nitesh
11,"Hey bro!
You have been one the best friends I've had here. I am so surprised how our paths would intersect each other so often. Man, I have talked to you many times when I was lost or clueless, and you always did help. You have a personality of gold. Also nice, we have spent fun time together - Nainital trip was awesome! Again I wonder how did we meet! I knew you before the trip, ah I have poor memory. From ee to nainital to cse to bbq to ml to birb pad to life, we have had a lot common things haha, and sab paths intersecting and happening together. It is awesome knowing you. Aise hi mast chapte rehna life mein!!",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cfa7dc659165b3aa64690d,Priyanshu  Gupta
12,"Yaar Ravi brooo! 
Hamare wing ke wing representative !!
Sharing so many courses yes, and so many assignments, os yay! Bhai sahi hai cse saath mein karne se auto saath mein acha time spend ho gaya 😂. Yaar Kitna sahi rehta tha ki apne kamre door rahe par still agal bagal. Even in last sem (last sem was awesome). I was just thinking ki although hamne saath mein bohot kuch nahi kiya but random baatein kaafi ki hai. Even last year room pe aa aa kar kuch 5 min bakchodi kaafi ki hai lol. 
It was great knowing you, and I hope you do great in your future too!",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cf9f8a659165b3aa646902,Ravi  Kumar
13,"Yo Lab Partner! I cannot believe how far back in time Phy labs were (I still have random memories)! I wish we could have maintained touch, it was nice knowing you!",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cfa4ff659165b3aa64690a,Ritika  Ajmera
14,"Bhai ham mile kaise the! I remember ki trip ke jaane se pehle defintely knew each other cannot trace back! Ok I just read your memoir it was PE! Bhai kya mast baatein ki hain hamne I too feel ki we think a lot alike. And yeah we did spend a lot of time together in first year - canteen mess ! Wing door hona was much bt, but still sahi raha apna. I hope to keep in touch and meet you whenever it transpires. Man I miss those days. (Also haan bhai that nainital trip felt awesome with you!)",Rohan  Gupta,False,60cfa248659165b3aa646905,Rohin  Gupta
15,"Yo bro!
Haan yaar last sem to gajab maza kiya hai! Bhai tum bhi mast mood mein the us din haha. Haan yaar sahi keh raha same dept hone par bhi kam hi baat hui. But yaaar sahi hai ki thodi mazedar cheezen kar li. Haan ab to same company! Hope to keep in touch",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cfbeda659165b3aa646927,Shivam Kumar (B P Singh)
16,"Roomie brooo! Maaf karna memoir jaisa likhna chahta tha, waisa mauka nahi mil raha. Yaar kitna mast samay raha hai ye journey. I have poor memory in general, but I still remember meeting you on first day of college. Abhi se match karunga to same nahi dekhoge, khair shayad us din shaant isliye the kyunki tumhare parents bhi the. I remember your medical box, usse iso propyl alcohol strip di thi tumne pehle hi dun kyunki maine ink faila di thi apne documents ya kapde pe, I remember not. Bhai kya 4 saal rahe hain ye. Kitna ghumte the 1st year mein, kitni bakchodi karte the. Stories kahin khatam hi nahi hoti. Astro club bhi kiya aur fir takneek hawa mein karke aa gaye the lol. Yaar chhoti chhoti yaaden, Smarth ke kamre pe ek baar darte hua gaye the 1st year mein, badminton khelna, mafia mast chapu admi the tum. Beating you at bluff in last sem will be one of my great achievements. Yaar light on/off ke jhagde haha. Aur 80% time to main tumko sota hua hi pata tha din mein :) Fir canteen pe dahi paratha khate the mast. Main to bas aise hi random yaaden stitch karte hue likh diya, inko bohot miss kar raha hun and karta rahunga. Bohot dukh hai ki aakhri saal maze poore nahi kar paaye. Lockdown mein baat-cheet khatam hi ho gayi thi bhala ho ark verma ka, firse saath mein kar diya. And jab campus wapasi hui to masttt. Bhai un teen hafton mein bhi jo pal beetain hai wo yaar bohot keemti the. Khoob maza kiya hai, and thodi asha hai ki thode aur mauke milenge. Milte hain firse, bhai 3 saal saath rahe ek doosre ko kahan se kahan jaate dekha hai.",Rohan  Gupta,True,60cf9215659165b3aa6468b6,Shrey  Jain
