Those were the first words I heard about you on campus and oh bhai, weren't they so true!!!
I've always wondered why did we talk so less over these 4 years. Keeping that aside, thanks for everything bro, every help in those OS assignments and exams and that too in your placement semester, it was a blessing to have you in that course.
NGL, was so happy to know about your placement and YOU DESERVED EVERY BIT OF IT.
It was also great to share some greetings in the last days at the campus, although you were mostly high (i guess).
All the best bro for everything in future, hope to stay connected. 
One last thing, who the fuck thinks about doing a MTH course in summers when they have the oppotunity to skip it???? MOFO AAKASH KHANDELWAL",Atharv  Tyagi,True,60a644d1819323d199d48d32,Aakash  Khandelwal
1,"HELLO BROTHER!
FIrst things first, I want to congratulate you again for placement and all the best for everything else you plan on doing in the future.
I remember how we survived those MTH courses in online/offline sem, lol. True that we never had much off dept or fun conversations but I guess there's always a next time for it? I guess sometimes we don't specially have to sit down with someone and give them a tag of friend. In some cases like ours, friendships grow out of random communications.
Hope to see you in the future sometime and iss baar bakchodi karenge.
All the best, take care sir!

2,"YO ABHAAAAAAAAAAAAA! I hope you feel the excitement in my voice (oh my words actually). You are a really really sweet person. We started talking from those PHY102 academic classes as far as I remember. Then, the friendship grew as we became part of the same team. BEST THING ABOUT ABHA : She laughs at every joke, something that I loved. Not to miss, you were the cute element of our team. 

I really enjoyed all the talks and meetings that we had. You are simply an amazing person. I wish to meet you in the future as well. Until then, take care. Much love.

3,"What do I write about you DKER? I remember bonding with only few member of OPS team and I am glad that you were one of them. 
I'm always going to remember those ""Ajayraj ki lene"" wale moments. Also, I'm gonna hate you for keeping secrets and flaming my excitement but that's okay. 
LSD LSD LSD, still echoes in my mind lol. You're definitely one of the best people I have met on campus. ",Atharv  Tyagi,True,608be90e819323d199d47220,Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju
4,"If there's one person on campus who I had always seen with a wide smile on his/her face, that MAISAM. 
Looking back at life in IITK, I will always remember you as a great friend. We became friends on volleyball ground and those volleyball matches of first year were the best.
Never got much chance to interact after first year but there's this friendship that's gonna stay. I really really hope to see you in near future and play a match again. Until then, all the best and take care brother.",Atharv  Tyagi,True,60a64696819323d199d48d5b,Maisam Ali Akhone
5,"Yo Mallu (and my birthday twin)!! If I ever made the right decision in college, it was choosing you as my roommate. Itna ideal kaise ho sakte ho bhaaii!
To this date as well, I hate those memories of your early morning coffee ke nashe and then subah subah pooja karke, you used to give me prasad in sleep. I was an idiot to mention this to my parents and I still get scoldings to be like you. Never had I ever seen someone actually use an alarm that requires you to solve math puzzles to snooze off. One thing that I missed the most was your shoulder massages (bhai bhai). I never feared about missing my breakfast because of you and even when I missed it, you used to bring me sprouts. Wing ki maaa tha tu. Oh and how can I forget forcing you into girls, lolol.
You are some sort of a weird person in yourself but we missed you during the last days. All the very best for anything you aspire to achieve. D111 will be our room!!",Atharv  Tyagi,True,608bfa63819323d199d47252,Ashwin  Girish
6,"This is going to be quite long and special. From the exchange of smiles in the first year during exams (bhosdike kyu haste the lekin hum, ye aaj tak ni pata) to exchanging almost every BT of life, we came a long way. The third semester was definitely the time we grew as friends. Fir Noida, fir Somnath sir ki classes, fir vo Santhanam sir ka khauf, it was a lot that we went through together. Tere gym ke randi rone, volleyball ke brags, feku madarchod. 
Keeping everything aside, I want you to grow as a person. Reach heights that you don't know you can achieve, but I know that you can. 
P**sy Li*ker, I'm gonna miss you bro.",Atharv  Tyagi,True,607e6f70819323d199d46b90,Atul  Arohi

Hope to see you soon and let's train together this time :P.",Atharv  Tyagi,True,60a67d1f819323d199d49076,Ayush  Bhorse
8,"From discussions about MTH coursework (which was torture anyway) to really important discussion in CS, we had a lot of memories. Believe it or not, you brought a really nice element to our Acads team.
All the very best for the future sir. As we all know, Mishra Ji chaapte hi rahenge.",Atharv  Tyagi,True,60a67c75819323d199d49062,Ayush  Mishra
9,"YO BABLOO BITCH, wing's fitness freak. (lol)

So I'm gonna try to express the gratitude and love I have for you because otherwise if I say in the wing group, you guys are gonna throw the tag of ""meetha meetha"".

It's been truly truly amazing 4 years in campus and you play a major role. Everyone who knows me outside of the wing also knows how much I praise my wingies, especially you. 
Do you remember that PHY103 endsem night!!! FUCK, uss din mujhe pata chala ki 100kilo ka aadmi ek chhoti si chair pe so sakta hai. I also learnt that summers ki Bhavesh can go without a bath for a month in May, DISGUSTING BC. Oh and you were so generous in second year ki you allowed a mouse to stay in the same room, divine soul you are. Lastly, thanks for introducing the wing to all types of bad things, without you it wasn't possible and I mean it. I have never seen a person with stronger will to manipulate me to have a drink xD.

I'm not saying ki hope to stay in touch, because we are going to. But I am going to say thanks for every factor of your personality because it made my campus life a little better always.
Much love bro, thoda meetha memoir chalta hai!",Atharv  Tyagi,False,60a64b64819323d199d48dbd,Bhavesh  Loungani
10,"Hi Chitranshi, I highly doubt that you remember the only interaction we had while in campus, lol. Thanks for the stubborn request of joining you guys in your tempo, I enjoyed your jokes, I swear.
Take care hooman, hope to meet the sober version of yours too.",Atharv  Tyagi,True,60a67bed819323d199d4905e,Chitranshi  Singh
11,"""AVVIIIIIIIIIIRAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!"" fuck, that was scary. Never thought that we would be friends but oh god we did. Do you remember all those evil vibes of competition we used to give me (tedhi nazre)? Started from a casual hello in TA lab, ended with a goodbye hug (oh, and that imli too xP). It was definitely a great journey with a lot of highs and lows (still sorry for that 5th sem ki overthinking). You can proudly say that you were the one behind showing me some places on campus that are not supposed to be visited. The only GH visit was to your room (mudreka kya chutiyo ki tarah kha raha tha uss din). 
I never thought a girl would hit so hard during my birthday GPL but TU JANWAR HAI. Also, vo dumbbell shaped bottle dope thi. When I look back, I feel proud of our friendship. All those discussions where we came to know each other a lot better. You are rare, that's a fact, varna how watches the videos of beheading someone and making a football out of it (MF Psycho xD!!). 
Well, what I know about you and how I've known you is a lot different from what people say about you. If Google ever plotted the data of personalitites of their employees, you would be that outlier! 
Take care, we'll stay in touch for sure.",Atharv  Tyagi,True,608bef50819323d199d4723f,Gunjan  Jalori

13,"If I have to summarise Harshit Garg in a sentence, ""Somebody who helps everyone selflessly"". You are a gem bro. From TA202 lab to today, I've always seen you as the same humble, modest guy. 
You have no idea how much ATUL AROHI praises you and he isn't an inch wrong. You deserve it all.
MICROSOFT is lucky!

15,"Hey yo! Do you remember who won the ludo game that day? Well I can say that I won since you were too drunk to remember who did. 
I guess that's the only time we ever interacted. All the very best for future, I hope things go great for you. ",Atharv  Tyagi,True,6097774f819323d199d47851,Kiran Kumari Meena
16,"Hello, Deepak/Dipak/Dipuk (a confusion which is going to stay a long time). 
We met through CS and I will always be thankful to CS for this friendship. You make everyone around you comfortable, people who know you absolutely love you including me. Thank you for equalizing all my emo-boy shayaris with your great ones and thank you for all the value you brought to our team. You were truly a blessing to the team. 
Your personality is something I've always and I will always admire bro. One can talk about anything to you, from mental health to jokes on not-so-appropriate topics. OH, AND WHO CAN FORGET THE SPAMMER SIDE OF DM!!! 
The more fun memories that we made were towards the end when I learned that you can dance so well (khaskar vo 1-2 steps). I hope to scream LSD!!!! LSD!!!! LSD!!!! again very soon. Those Inference quizzes were fun too, kya hi karte the yaar. AJAYRAJ ke room mein usi ki udana still remains on top. I will always miss the planned photoshoot which never happened but it will happen for sure.
I'm happy that Noida isn't too far and I'm definitely coming to meet you guys. Until then, take care brother. Thanks for making my campus life better than what it would have been otherwise.

17,"HELLO Manisha, the Instagram friend. I have always wondered why did we never talk outside of social media, lol. Kinda sad but okay.
I agree that vo restaurant vali meeting doesn't count because I guess we two were the only sober ones trying to keep the bhands in place. Hope to meet you in the future. Until then, we will keep those random ig conversations going on :P.
Also, as far as I know from other people, you're a great person. I don't know if people come straight to you and tell that to you so I'll just let you know from their sides.
Lastly, all the best for life ahead. <3",Atharv  Tyagi,True,60a648ad819323d199d48d88,Manisha  Meena

Bro, we know each other from first year, vo Eclub ka project, xD. From there to ending up in the same team and then the same internship, it was a fun journey. I remember all those walks and talks about life, girls and what not. You're one of the most hard working guys I've ever seen, period. You're a great friend that one can look up to, anytime. Ngl, I get inspiration from you at times so you can imagine the amount of respect I have for you. Apart from hardworking, you're definitely harami as well. Aur bhai bhai, last mein to jo nashe kiye tumhare group ne😂😂. I remember when we hugged after coming to the campus, you were high that time but I absolutely loved seeing you again. You're one of the nicest guys for sure.

From saving my ass and keeping me sane during the internship to discussions on tinder profiles to your fitness transformation journey, it's been just too nice and perfect. I definitely remember cracking those ""not so appropriate"" jokes in CS during serious discussions.
