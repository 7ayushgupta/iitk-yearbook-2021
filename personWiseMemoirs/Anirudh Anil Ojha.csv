Day 1 se kattne waale din tu mujhse zyada BT me na hota toh shayad mai khud ko sambhal na pata (jabtak sambhala tab tak bhi). Wahan se leke OS and ECO201, sab me kaafi help ki hai. Thoroughly enjoyed all the deep and shallow discussions we've had. TT ho ya other sorts of comparisions, sab me tu mujhe close competition de ke haara hai and I appreciate your efforts. Last month me bhi apan kaafi maze kar paaye ye badhiya baat hai, lekin saath me peena abhi baaki hai dost.

Pre-covid times ki last raat jahan chodi thi, laut ke wahin se shuru ki. Tere jaane ke baad parties me vo feel rahi hi nhi. Thanks for being a bridge for me to amazing times with the Hall 2 gang. I don't think my campus experience the last month would have been half of what it was, without you. Everyone knows you as the party-maker, but individual seshs with you have always given me a glimpse of something with a desire to be much deeper. Love your vibe, your playlists and your attitude towards life. Buy that bartender kit soon. Badminton me aur face-offs karte hain but I think mai ma chod dunga.

Tujhe yaad karta hu toh first year me hall ka best photographer and 2nd year onwards ka guitarist yaad aata hai. Mess me jab tere Russia ke experiences puch rha tha tab bohot dilute kar ke bataaya.

From Orientation to ECO101 to winter camp to OS to Hall 12 we go long back brother, and thou shalt always have a friend in me.

And of course, VR me apne struggles. First assignment me leaderboard, 4th assignment me Jhunjhunwala ki rehem and endsem Priyanshu ke saath 1/3rd padh ke pura paper answer karna. You amaze and inspire me with your hard work and nature. Tune jitni help ki hai courses me I have no clue koi kyu karega kisi ki bhi.

I remember I asked you about the ""12 baje"" thing and you told me the guerilla warfare story behind it. But jald hi pata chal gaya ki kaafi chill banda hai jab mere weird light on-off kinks ko accommodate kiya. First year ki memories yaad karne me maza aata hai - AD Bansal, Shubham se ladai and mera intermediary hona, Takneek me electronics me fraud maarna, SAE se kattne ka gum, Antaragni me family tradition uphold karte hue security karna. A special mention to jab HC me jhoom ke gira tha and meri gaand fatt gyi thi. But uske baad tune khaane ko seriously lena shuru kiya and teri mumma ne bohot saare snacks diye jo maine khaaye, so even that's a happy memory. Baapu ke saath bohot saare gapp, sab ki bitching, mess me tere bache extras khaana, canteen me khaana share karna, badminton and TT khelna and birthdays me raat ko naachna - you were the only constant in IITK life and the one from the beginning to the end.

Aur recent memories me jaun toh cricket me tere ko multiple times bowled karna yaad aata hai, and Kuldeep-Ishan ka jhagda suljhaana. CSO me saath padhna (?) and election raat ko tere behalf pe (mis)counting kar ke bataana. And that sweet sweet Galaxy victory.

Apni puri journey toh saath me hi plan ki hai humne. Interns se leke job tak, insecurities se leke girl-troubles tak (more applicable for me). You have seen the best and the worst of me in every sphere of life, and the fact that you still stick by me is very relieving. Having seen the multiple lows of your life, all the highs hit so sweet like they were my own. ITC se leke AnC and ab Zomato tak, you have had a journey to be proud of and I feel proud to have been part of it.

Goa me tere piche scooty pe baith ke maza aa gya. Police waale ke saath waali BT bhi ab funny lag rhi hai but thullon se deal karna seekh liya ab tere se and iski use me daalunga some time in Gurgaon. Thanks for always being by my side.

Learnt a lot from you since our time in CFD, with the advice regarding ideal time into a relationship to have sex being the highlight. The debates (featuring Dandi) over religion, virtue and vice were always appreciated. Loved your transition from a self-proclaimed God-fearing Marwari to a paragon of nashe on campus.
Pehli baar phoonkna, pehla blowback and pehli ulti yaad rahegi. Thanks for being a good friend, then and now.
