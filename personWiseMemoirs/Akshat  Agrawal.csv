Subject : Tum aache ho aur bahut bade Madarchod bhi 

Dear Harshit,
It was a very good time of around 3 years which we had spent together.Tu nahi hota toh the fun quotient of the  wing would have dropped significantly. I remember the first sem ka Harshit jo rota rehta tha and since then there was no looking back uske baad toh bas daase aur pranks aur masti hi hai to look forward. I hope ab tu kabhi bhi life mai flight tickets bina destination dekhe nahi bharega. My most proudest moment of IITK is still jab maine samu aur bandar ke saath milke teri cycle upar pahucha di thi. Also thanks verma boi for teaching me and samu ESC201 5 minutes before quiz and yes teri treat pending mai next jab milte toh dunga . Yaad hai kaise humne  sabko Atop pe pahucha diya tha and apan dono A206 aur A204 le liye the. 
Last sem was fun. Those among us nights, poker nights, Frisbee nights ;),  that Upmanyu ka show jaha apan sab gif mai convert ho gae the . Last but not the least the parties jaha # kanuumerikanuu #Tpkobulao and #AkshatMadarchod famous hue the . I still don't know maine kya kiya tha to deserve that. I have our paths cross again. 


Till that P**ma Lmao

Thank You,

You were the most regular players on the tennis court and I have seen your game improve immensely. Maine Teri forehand ki itne tarif Suni hai ki Del Porto type hai tera forehand 😅😅. I really wanted to play with you but wahi last sem thodi health issue tha toh court kaam aaya but jab bhi next mauka milega we will play.

19,"Hey, lunch date and cooler twin from summer camp. The summer camp was difficult but it was fun and doable because of your constant companionship. We had small moments of happiness - be it trying new things on hall 4 menu( I think we tried almost everything by the end) , our coolers arriving, glucon-d breaks, nimbu Paani during lunch and many more. Also thanks for my awesome service shot on the final day of camp.
Apart from this, I am very surprised and proud to see the Arjav who I found quite shy and reserved initially transformed into a confident and open person organizing and conducting great events and workshops.
All the best for future Bhai and keep following your passion",Akshat  Agrawal,True,60cf595b659165b3aa646627,Modi Arjav Himanshubhai

21,"We got to know each other from the Freshers inferno Initially I was a bit envious as everyone was like Batra header goal bhi maar raha, swimming Mai bhi phaad raha, Badminton Mai bhi chaap raha and I didn’t get to play TT and football games due to clashes. But soon after getting to know you I was happy ki yeh tennis nahi khelta 😛.  Playing football/ volleyball with you and Dtop was fun but playing against your wing uska mazza kuch aur hi tha.( inter wing semis ki loss was due to umpiring errors even you know it ). Also stop crediting your theory of negativity for us reaching the IFL semis it was the team that made it possible . 

I don’t know whether you will be a quantum computationalist( not sure if that’s a word 😛), physicists , chef or god knows what  but jo bhi hoga you would be the best in that field. Bas jab bhi next mile don’t be a chutiya jaise abhi hai and keep playing.

You were one of the most helpful people around, always ready to help anyone in need.
Last month to special tha hi we played among us, poker, badminton had lots of parties and you managed to be a part of all that despite your internship. I know you have a very bright future bas hum sab d-mid waalo ko mat bhul  jaana aur Zomato ke coupons bhi bhejte rehna 😅😅😅.
