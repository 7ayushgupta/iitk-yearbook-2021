Especially irritating you about football, and you posting the weirdest pictures of me online. Thanks for being there all the time every time! Most of all thanks for being such a great friend! 

P.S: This is not goodbye, just a short note for the yearbook. Picture to abhi baaki hai mere dost!",Aman  Saraf,True,60cf954f659165b3aa6468c9,Aditya  Sharma
1,"Bhai from going to tutorials together in the first year and then Honda YES together in the third year, it has been quite a journey! Thanks for being the great guy you are, and I am sure our paths will cross again. Till then take care and continue being the awesome individual you are!",Aman  Saraf,True,60cf95d8659165b3aa6468cd,Aditya  Singh
2,"Hey man! After kinda knowing you throughout my time at IITK, I finally got to really meet and know you in our last month on campus! I'm a little sad it didn't happen earlier, but glad that it happened finally! I hope you continue being the awesome guy you are and I'm sure we'll see each other again soon!",Aman  Saraf,True,60cf96a1659165b3aa6468d4,Akshay
3,"Baldip mere bhai! It was a pleasure knowing you from the first year idealist to the third/fourth year realist you became! You were the guy I would come to most often for advice, and well to party with as well! I'm pretty sad that we haven't met in so long, but I'm sure our paths will cross soon! Memories ki list banaunga toh this will become an encyclopedia so I'll spare you the trouble.

To my coordie in arms, keep being the honest, hardworking, and great guy that you are. Tere se bohot seekha hai, and I am sure abhi aur seekhunga. Thanks for everything!",Aman  Saraf,True,60cf9831659165b3aa6468e1,Baldip Singh Bijlani
4,"Bashir! Through our constant arguments, frequent debates and ccd escapes, I came to have a deep appreciation and respect for the person you are!  From carrying out the biggest ""rich-fucker"" propaganda campaign I have ever seen, to the long chats we have had in front of southern block canteen, its safe to say our time at IITK has had its fair share of ups and downs! But I wouldn't wish it to be any other way! I'm glad it all happened the way it did, and I hope we meet again at a cafe soon, where you try to convince the person sitting next to me that I am a rich fucker while you hold a MacBook Pro in your hand! 😂",Aman  Saraf,False,60cf99cc659165b3aa6468ee,Bashirul Islam Sheikh
5,"Bro!! Thanks for being the most chill person in the wing and for always looking out for me, and forcing me to have fun! With the number of memories we have, it's almost guaranteed that I will forget something, but let me try anyway. Orientation 2017 & 2018.....Multiple trips to Mocha and Liqquid.....Not to forget every Antaragni and Techkriti ever .....the list goes on and on. Although our time in IITK was cut short by the pandemic, we have many pegs (xD) to go before we sleep! Abhi toh picture baaki hai mere dost!",Aman  Saraf,True,60c22776659165b3aa6459da,Chirag  Kapoor
6,"Faizan!! I'm glad I got to know you as well as I did in the last month at IITK. Had some crazy times and wild parties. From being one of the coolest people I know on campus to the person I go to for advice on robotics, it has been a crazy ride the whole way through! Let's keep in touch as we head into the US, I'm sure great things await you! Godspeed!",Aman  Saraf,False,60cf9bb9659165b3aa6468f5,Faizan  Siddiqui
7,"Hemant!!! From the techkriti where I first got to know you so well, it has been a pleasure to spend time with you and have discussions on the craziest of topics with you. Through the parties, deep-dives, and CCD convos, you have been one of the most interesting people I have known at IITK. Thanks for being my double major buddy while it lasted, and listening to me blabber on about the weirdest of topics in the middle of the night! I hope our paths cross again soon and I hope your double major is the best time of your life! Keep partying, keep asking questions, keep reading, but most of all keep being the awesome guy you are! Godspeed!",Aman  Saraf,False,60cf9cc8659165b3aa6468f8,Hemant  Kejriwal
8,"Bhai, remember all the discussions we have had through our years at IITK, from academics to life at large! The walks from CCD to CC and back, the long nights discussing stuff in the wing. You're one of the nicest people I know on campus. Thanks for everything!",Aman  Saraf,True,60cf9da1659165b3aa6468fd,Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh
9,"Pankaj Mere Bhai (Quite Literally lmao),
I have never seen someone with a love for literature  as great as yours! Being one of the best people to share philosophical thoughts with, some of the most interesting conversations I have had on campus  are with you. Baaki cocktails and parties toh chalengi bro, whenever and wherever we meet! This is not goodbye its only until nextime!

PS: Campus ki best cycle ka award tujhe milna chahiye!",Aman  Saraf,True,60a6730f819323d199d49015,Pankaj  Kumar
10,"Bhai, 4 saal EE mein tere karan nikle hai! From copying labwork to partying, humne sabse boring se sabse interesting cheeze saath mein ki hai! Its not everyday ki someone comes across a chill person like you, who you can depend on.
Thanks for the chickblast memories and borrowing (stealing xD) my mouse! Thanks for being the guy who I could laugh with after EE stress and for finishing all the hot water before I could go for a bath!  Mostly, thanks for being there, hamesha! 
Anyway ye sentimental posts likhne ka yeh matlab nahi hai ki this is goodbye. It's just see you later!",Aman  Saraf,True,60c2256c659165b3aa6459ab,Ritesh  Naik
