Cult-man of Y17 CSE. Your drams performance were really awesome. Dramatics was the only club whose performance I watched frequently (because of Varun and Nipun). You managed drams activities and department simultaneously, and it is no less than an inspiration.

Our first collaboration was obviously in TA201. Saath me kaafi bakchodi karte the :P fir bhi project kisi tarah nikal liya. But I still feel really sad ki our ""Floating Ram Mandir"" idea got rejected, atleast pehla Ram Mandir banta humara. Fir we frequently contacted in CS640, wrote a term paper and did a decent presentation in the limited time frame.

2nd-year tak we hardly interacted with each other. In fact, your room in C4 was also due to a tussle between our parent wings. Lekin once you joined C4, got to interact more with you.

We know each other from 11th but didn't talk till late class 12th. I thought you are a very ""shaant"" type of person, less talkative-more work, but it was as wrong as it could be. Our initial chats ""Askr"" were more about RETs, AITS etc. Never knew we'll spend our IIT time so close.

We enjoyed a lot in our college stay. Saath assignments karte the, class jaate the (bahut kam jaate the although), Z-sq jaate the, Domino's ka pizza khaate the, CCD jaate the etc. CFD aur ICPC bhi saath gaye the. I have spent some of my most beautiful memories of IITK with you. 

My only way to crack group assignments was simple -- get you and Umang together and then just chill. You always absorbed the technical parts and left non-technicals to us. Interestingly, humare saare collaborations turned out really well and I hope it is true in future as well.

Start wahin se karte hain jahan se silsila shuru hua tha. Khandelwal sir exam topper. IMO medalist tak ka chhakka chudaye the tum, ussi din se samajh gaye the ki thodi doori me ek khatarnak banda rehta hai. Uske baad prep ke dauran toh baat nahi hui, but Mishra ke through thoda bahut hoti thi.

First day in the wing, wing session ke baad thoda depressing type lag rha tha. Kissi ko jaante nahi the (except Shivam) aur darr ka mahaul tha. Wing intro me ""Mera naam Deepesh Kumar Lall hai ..."" iske baad bada achha sa laga, pata nahi kyon. Aisa laga ki yahan koi aur bhi hai jisko jaante hain. Ofc dono ek doosre ko jaante the, par kabhi baat nahi hui thi (strange but true). Fir dosti ka silsila shuru hua. First year me saath me class jaana, mess jaana, bakchodi karna, party karna, canteen jaana etc. Wing split ke baad bhi saath rehne ka saubhagya prapt hua.

2nd year me kaafi enjoy kiye the, seriously. Kitni baar CCD gaye honge, bulla sessions @infy aur games. Padhai ka discussions to secondary ho gaya. Fir intern ka struggle, but death over me chhakka lag hi gaya (lol) aur tumko sabse pehle bataye the offer ka. This year was chill + fun ...

3rd year me bhi agal bagal rhe. 5th sem was the lowest in your life. Kaafi struggles ek tackle karne pade the -- CPI kharab hui thi tumhari, but everything was momentary, you recovered and came stronger (aur fir toh phod hi diya). First PPO from our wing, first manuscript (publish nahi hua :() from our wing, aur fir toh gadar.

Most jolly and tension-free person I have met in life. Let's revise the memories we made briefly. Thodi lambi timeline hai, bear with me. Not to mention, we grew from a child -- to a teenager -- to an adult -- to a mature responsible person together.

2013 me mile the hum log. Same section me nahi the par fir bhi sandwich khane aate the tum. Dheere dheere mitrta pragadh hui. 10th me bhi saath baithte the humlog aur bakchodi karte the. Random logon ko dhamkana (lol). Abhi bhi mailbox ke sent section me kuchh mails pade hain 2014 ke, ek map hai India ka aur kuchh jagah marked hain, shayad kisi exam ke silsile me bheje honge. Bahut masti kiye but towards the end of class 10th thoda Bodh-gyan prapt hua, ki aise toh nahi chalege. Saath me hi Khandelwal sir ke pass gaye the (biscuit incident yaad hai na?).

NTSE stage 2 prep poora saath kiye the -- books, papers, problems sab. 11th me aake things were different - school me bhi saath rehte the aur coaching me bhi. ""Aap inko borbad kar dijiyega?"" (yaad hai na? lol). 11th-12th ka time bahut sahi tha. Kaafi bakchodi kiye, enjoy kiye aur saath JEE diye.

Niyati ko shayad saath kuchh aur lamba karna tha, nahi toh kya hi probability hai ki do dost saath me JEE den -- same IIT mile -- same hall mile -- same wing mile -- aur aamne-samne ka room mile. Par IITK me aake confirm hua ki abhi at least 4 saal aur saath rhenge. Fir toh kya masti kiye -- belt leke room me dhamki, game (PUBG champion), CCD Party, Magai sessions aur Bulla. Mess-Canteen tk me saath jaate the. Probability ke viprit tumne intern bhi 1 floor neechel lagwa li, woh bhi Singapore me! Singapore me bhi enjoy kiye, although utna nahi.

I am sure ki future me bhi saath ventures karenge -- constantly interact karenge. I wish you all success in life. Kaash thoda perseverance aur aa jaye tumhare pass and then you will be the poster boy of JVM-IITK-success stories. Lekin humare liye toh tum ""dober"" hi rahoge. All the Best !

It is a privelege to have known you. First-bencher, consistent, and a smart entrepreneur, this is how I will remember you. 

Your philosophy of work hard - earn hard - create assets - live like a king, is great. We only collaborated on one project till date i.e. TA202 but we had quite a lot of fun there. I am sure you'll do great in life. Looking to collaborate with you on more fruitful ventures in future ...",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60abb29f659165b3aa644daa,Yash  Baheti

Kaafi chill, hardworking aur intelligent -- your traits as I remember. On campus interaction kaafi kam tha but online mode me kaafi interact kiye. Bhavishya me bhi karte rhenge LKO me. I am sure you'll do great in future. All the Best!",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60c24ce9659165b3aa645ed0,Yasharth  Bajpai

You are the CS gawd of IITK Y17. Your knowledge about systems is unparalleled. Department me patta bhi tumse puchhke hilta tha. Whenever I had many things to be done at same time, I always took inspiration from you. First year me you did CFD, GSoC and extra course together. Fir 1st year me internship and 3rd year me toh 3 internships together _/\_. I never expected you'll be joining a PhD. Infact, shayad last person I would have thought. I am sure you will do phenomenally well in life! You are humble, intelligent and ambitious. I wish we collaborate on some project at least once in future ...",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60ab438c659165b3aa644d74,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
