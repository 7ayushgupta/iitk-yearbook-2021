Humari dosti kaafi purani hai, right from JEE days. We had an awesome time in chatroom2004 discussing interesting problems.

Uske baad we really enjoyed at IITK, shayad aur karte but niyat ko kuchh aur manzoor tha :(. You were the go to guy for me for discussing assignment problems. Kabhi kisi project par collaborate nahi kar paye, but future me zaroor karenge. 

You are truly one of the most intelligent guy I have met. In addition to that, you have a golden heart which is indeed the rarest commodity. I am sure you will keep rocking as you always did. Smalls ups-and-downs are part of life and we have seen many of them together, even before coming to campus. I am happy that we 
always recovered from it together. Iss bhai ko kabhi mat bhoolna ...",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60a4ee7c819323d199d482a0,Aniket  Sanghi
1,"Anirban bhai, you are gem of a person. ""Koshish karne waalon ki kabhi haar nahi hoti"", you taught me this in truest sense. Saath me bulla katna, bakchodi karna, ek dusre ka mazak udana, treats, gaana, random stories, kharrata and what not. GPL me tumse zyada kutai shayad hi kisiki ki ho (arguably). Kaash kuchh time aur rehte campus me but niyat ko kuchh aur hi manzoor tha. I hope you excel in every endeavour you ever take up in life.",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,607e7879819323d199d46bbc,Anirban  Ghosh

Start wahin se karte hain jahan se silsila shuru hua tha. Khandelwal sir exam topper. IMO medalist tak ka chhakka chudaye the tum, ussi din se samajh gaye the ki thodi doori me ek khatarnak banda rehta hai. Uske baad prep ke dauran toh baat nahi hui, but Mishra ke through thoda bahut hoti thi.

First day in the wing, wing session ke baad thoda depressing type lag rha tha. Kissi ko jaante nahi the (except Shivam) aur darr ka mahaul tha. Wing intro me ""Mera naam Deepesh Kumar Lall hai ..."" iske baad bada achha sa laga, pata nahi kyon. Aisa laga ki yahan koi aur bhi hai jisko jaante hain. Ofc dono ek doosre ko jaante the, par kabhi baat nahi hui thi (strange but true). Fir dosti ka silsila shuru hua. First year me saath me class jaana, mess jaana, bakchodi karna, party karna, canteen jaana etc. Wing split ke baad bhi saath rehne ka saubhagya prapt hua.

2nd year me kaafi enjoy kiye the, seriously. Kitni baar CCD gaye honge, bulla sessions @infy aur games. Padhai ka discussions to secondary ho gaya. Fir intern ka struggle, but death over me chhakka lag hi gaya (lol) aur tumko sabse pehle bataye the offer ka. This year was chill + fun ...

3rd year me bhi agal bagal rhe. 5th sem was the lowest in your life. Kaafi struggles ek tackle karne pade the -- CPI kharab hui thi tumhari, but everything was momentary, you recovered and came stronger (aur fir toh phod hi diya). First PPO from our wing, first manuscript (publish nahi hua :() from our wing, aur fir toh gadar. Ab toh bas shivam ke saath ek baar firse tumhara band bajana hai, usse mast kaam kya hi hoga duniya mein. But all this is just for fun (you know better). You are an inspiration, a true brother, grounded and what not. Milte rahenge humesha. US jaake bhoolna mat.

You were, are and forever will be the Theoretical CS gawd of Y17. Your passion for approaching problems, both theoretical and real-world is inspiring. We interacted a lot, especially in the context of ACA, where I found an entirely different version of you. I hope I also get an opportunity to collaborate with you on research in future. Keep shining, Keep innovating. All the best!",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,60a4efd0819323d199d482a8,Devansh  Shringi

Most jolly and tension-free person I have met in life. Let's revise the memories we made briefly. Thodi lambi timeline hai, bear with me. Not to mention, we grew from a child -- to a teenager -- to an adult -- to a mature responsible person together.

2013 me mile the hum log. Same section me nahi the par fir bhi sandwich khane aate the tum. Dheere dheere mitrta pragadh hui. 10th me bhi saath baithte the humlog aur bakchodi karte the. Random logon ko dhamkana (lol). Abhi bhi mailbox ke sent section me kuchh mails pade hain 2014 ke, ek map hai India ka aur kuchh jagah marked hain, shayad kisi exam ke silsile me bheje honge. Bahut masti kiye but towards the end of class 10th thoda Bodh-gyan prapt hua, ki aise toh nahi chalege. Saath me hi Khandelwal sir ke pass gaye the (biscuit incident yaad hai na?).

NTSE stage 2 prep poora saath kiye the -- books, papers, problems sab. 11th me aake things were different - school me bhi saath rehte the aur coaching me bhi. ""Aap inko borbad kar dijiyega?"" (yaad hai na? lol). 11th-12th ka time bahut sahi tha. Kaafi bakchodi kiye, enjoy kiye aur saath JEE diye.

Niyati ko shayad saath kuchh aur lamba karna tha, nahi toh kya hi probability hai ki do dost saath me JEE den -- same IIT mile -- same hall mile -- same wing mile -- aur aamne-samne ka room mile. Par IITK me aake confirm hua ki abhi at least 4 saal aur saath rhenge. Fir toh kya masti kiye -- belt leke room me dhamki, game (PUBG champion), CCD Party, Magai sessions aur Bulla. Mess-Canteen tk me saath jaate the. Probability ke viprit tumne intern bhi 1 floor neechel lagwa li, woh bhi Singapore me! Singapore me bhi enjoy kiye, although utna nahi.

I am sure ki future me bhi saath ventures karenge -- constantly interact karenge. I wish you all success in life. Kaash thoda perseverance aur aa jaye tumhare pass and then you will be the poster boy of JVM-IITK-success stories. Lekin humare liye toh tum ""dober"" hi rahoge. All the Best !

""Oh BKL drams waalon ne g**** m***i humari.""
""Hatt bc""
""Humare Jaipur mein...""

Ye mehez lafz nahin, jazbat hain humare liye. Woh jazbat jo ab hain bhi aur nahi bhi. Thoda flashback me chalte hain.

Day 1 : Almari lock karke nikal gaye hum (:P)

Taekwando : kaafi chill marwaya tha instructor ne 

Room-Class-Chaabi-Bathroom : Aadhi samasyaon ka karan yahi combo tha!

Bloody Marry! (Bhai maza aaya tha uss din)

Mess secy elections (with me as star pracharak and manifesto writer)

CCD Parties (Loco financed)

Gin and Ginger party (purely incidental)

Mast bakchodi karna (random stories, discussions)

Tere Jaipur ke dino ko yaad karna. Tumse zyada achhe se toh hmko Jaipur ka naksha yaad ho gaya hoga. Yaad hai na Aakash Jaipur ke din (lol).

Kanpuriya traders : the thing we cooked up recently. But yahi ek constant interaction ka platform banega.

Ant mein, bas yahi kaamna hai ki Marwari dharm ka palan karo, khub paisa kamao (aur hume bhi kamwao). Kya pata ye Kanpuriya traders hi kal India ka top Hedge fund ban jaye aur tum ""The Big Bull"". Waise kuchh aur bhi karoge, achha hi karoge tumhari ichchha. Baaki baatein chalti rahengi, yearbook to mehez aupcharikta hai.

Itni memories hain ki list bhi nahi ban sakta. Fir bhi kuchh try karte hain --

""Bloody Marry"" pe bed se kudna (bhai darre the tum maano ya nahi)

Kambal ke andar BKL se chat karna, aur mujhe dono ki info rehti thi 😛

GPL agreements aur 7 RCR me bulake sabko dhona.

""Bhai Canteen chalega?"" 2 ghante me endsem aur 0 prep pe bhi kabhi negative response nahi.

GTA V was lubb. Kab subah ho jaati thi bakchodi karte karte yaad bhi nahi rehta tha.

Teri namkeen Neemuch waali masha allah. Kabhi snacks ki kami nahi mehsus hoti thi. Canteen band hone ke baad bhi tere pass aate the stock ke liye.

Tere room pe late night party aur movie! Yaad hai na? Dictator movie. Aur bhi kitni movie dekhte agar ye covid na aata.

Dosa ke liye Sunday ko line lagana (lol).

Lucknow me aur bakchodi kar skte the but time constraint ne maara.

Tum toh ek saal aur ho campus me. Hopefully memories banana. Jo bhi karoge (Industry, UPSC ya research) achha karoge, bharosa hai. Best wishes for your future. Humesha yaad rkhna! ",Abhyuday  Pandey,True,608d763a819323d199d47670,Parth  Luwaria

8,"Dear Collector Sahab

Jai Hind.

Kahan se shuru kiye the journey aur kahan aa gaye, ab toh bas naam ke collector ho tum, andar se ""slave of capitalism"" (lol).

Thoda flashback me chalte hain.

 2nd sem me saath me RM jaate the magne, RM101 ke saamne, 3rd floor se utarkar. Baad me kuch aur logon ko bhi location mil gaya tha but that looked like a safe haven. Fir ek din bhoot dikhi, yaad hai ? (teri g**** fa**i thi bhai, woh expression bhulaye nahi bhulta)

We enjoyed a lot together. Particularly saare course hi common lete the, saath lecture jaate the, midsem-endsem ka saath magte the, party karte the etc. Hum logon ke courses ka Hamming distance bahut kam hoga (lol). After 1st sem, 3rd was slightly low for you but fir toh jo trajectory li, aaj tak uska return mil raha hai.

# Parties in CCD + # Magai sessions + # Bulla sessions = stack_overflow

Online hone ke baad bhi we interacted almost daily. To put things concisely, we almost lived IITK life in the same lens. Itni memories hain ki enumerate nahi kar skte. But kai common interests hain humare  -- stock market, capitalism, and everything that is good for humanity (proven). In sab par charchayen hoti hi rahengi bhavishya me. You really have a vast knowledge base of General Knowledge (typical collector stuff...) but you are also analytical and logical. I am sure you will do exceedingly well in future. You are a true brother and I'll always cherish the memories. Remain humble, patient and knowledgeable throughout your life. Most probably Gurgaon me bhi saath hi rahenge, toh yearbook memoir is just a formality ...
