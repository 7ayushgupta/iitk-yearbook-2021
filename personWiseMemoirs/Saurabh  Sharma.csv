Two secrets of this lil' baby - 
First - Zoo has a surname - 'Chaudhary', but sarkari kagaj per ghapla hone ki vajah se ye apna surname chupati phirti hai. 👀

Second - Ye asal me 'Jhunjhunu' ki rehne vali hai, but sabhi ko sharm ke mare aapna hometown 'Jaipur' btati hai. 😛

उसे ज़िन्दगी से कोई और शिकायत क्या होगी ||

Shrey yar... kya haseen time gujara hai hamne sath me. HSS-Galaxy ki tayari vali vo raaten, phir canteen me rat ka khana, vhan se bat karte karte aana, bacchon ki tayari ki sameeksha karna, aur phir seedhiyon ke kone per alvida kehna. Aaj bhi jab kabhi CS Prize Ceremony me tere sath hue 'हादसे' ke bare me sochta hun to... chehra pe muskaan aa hi jati hai. Yar, tere sath liye huye chai ke vo ghoont, GOT/BATMAN per hue discussions, physics ki tareef, and xyz har pal - mere college time ke kuch best lamhon me se hain | Hmesha yaad rhenge. 💕❤🎶


Tera canteen se dahi leke mess me aana, aur phir  mujhe 'Aao Bhai Sharma' kehke bulana; 
tera classes aur quizzes miss karna aur phir use bade garv se btana; 
Tera - 'Physics me kuch karne ka' sapna mujhe btana;
Tera - Ark verma ko ittna shandar mail likhne ke bad bhi course me D de dene ke liye Gaaliyan dena;

aur esi teri bahot sari baaten, sab yad rhengi mujhe !! ✨

Bhai, mujhe teri haryaanvi avaj aur usse jhalakte confidence se pyar hai yar. Tu vo karta hai, jo tera man kehta hai. Mast khool ke jeene vala banda hai yar tu.. jise na to beete kal ka gam hai.. aur na hi aane val kal ki fikra... bas kuch hai to aaj me jeene ki chaht aur future me kcuh bda karne ki ummed. 
Bahot aage jaayega yar tu. Hmesha sath rhenge.

Remember we used to sit together in Numerical's TA sessions. Bro from that utsav to new utsav (blended with shreyash and millenium) and again back to old utsav. what a change yar ! Just amazing. You know what I liked about you - A great friendly nature, a nice gentle personality and a perfectly smiling face which takes away all the problems. It's a gift bro - don't let anyone take them away from you.
