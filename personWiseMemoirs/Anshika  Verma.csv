Known you for 4 years now. You are the one person who has been a constant and has supported me through every phase of my campus life, literally everything. We have had some amazing time together and I would always cherish what we had. You have dealt with all the cranky me during exams, indecisive me on what to eat, lazy me for attending classes, and much more. Whatever I write or say will not do justice to how nice you have been to me. 

It’s amazing that we could pull off the Udaipur and Goa trip. I think I would always feel comfortable reaching out to you and I hope you feel the same.

1,"Awwnawwnaww, 

So, you are the first person I approached to help me with my insomnia by just moving that bed table and being all cute about allowing me to sleep there next to you. You introduced me to The Office, so I owe you fo sho. You were my 3 am 3rd floor RO water fetching buddy. Also, you are the cutest when tickled while sleeping( take note bf xD). It has been so easy with you, I could just barge into your room and spend hours. You have been so comforting and understanding through everything. You were there for all those walks and discussions when I needed someone the most and I'll be there for you too. 

The moment we got that intern call, hugs when drunk, giving a quiz while sleeping, random knocks at my door to just check on me will stay with me forever.

8,"Heyyy Neil, 

I was very skeptical about working with a new person. Also, to top that you had this OCD for organizing the google drive, sorting the footnote, header, mails, everything. But even in the beginning, the good cop/bad cop manager interviews gave me the taste that it will be an interesting journey with you. You were such a balance to my skills that everything became so easy to manage. 

How scared were you when we had that meeting with DoRA in the evening and I wasn't picking up your call until half an hour before it? I can't laugh enough at this one. XD 
Should have written XD after every statement, no? 

 Honestly, I was extremely disappointed that you couldn't come to Goa. Humne toh itinerary bhi saath mein banai thi. I had even prepared myself for a random bhand encounter with you on some beach. Also, ENG rants Neil, we can start a page on this one. 

Vodka cocktails for when we meet next or for the first time, lol. ",Anshika  Verma,True,60cfb9dd659165b3aa64691d,Neil Rajiv Shirude
9,"Avani, 
I saved your contact as 'Avniiii 😘😘"" in the first year. Yes, emojis!! And you need to know that the only other person to share this privilege is my mum. That was how much you meant to me back then and now, even more. Morning knocks for hand wash, the upgraded veg Maggi version of mine, our repetitive discussions in lockdown, trying to frame logics for 'you know what', finding the most non-spicy food on the menu, 2 am chats in your room will always stay with me. In fact, when I had my final internship presentation the next morning at 8 and you called me at 3, I would never have picked that call up if it wasn't for you. Also, that's when we coined the 'minimum 3-hour discussion' term.  

That last day on campus with you, I felt that I will miss sitting in your room more than I will miss mine. Also, you are the only person who will haunt me till eternity. Thank you for sitting at the foot of my bed at 4 am in the morning and scaring the life out of me.  

You're the best and I will love you forever. *crying* ",Anshika  Verma,True,60cf8947659165b3aa646863,Avani  Shrivastava

Goa trip got so much better due to those scooty rides with you, it did not feel like that this was probably the first time we were actually hanging out. Not being able to keep up with the navigation part just because the ride discussions were so immersive. Matching up people's stories on that BnB's balcony. Seeing you struggle for not feeling bhand enough and yet enjoying because people around you were. Even I was disappointed because after those Techkriti whisky chugs, projectile vomiting stunt, I was hoping for more such stuff. 
Strip! Strip! Strip!  

So, you introduced me to JD and now I trust you the most for daaru, never having anything less than a premium whisky now. I have absolutely fallen in love with feni and the credit is all yours. Be it the trip or the 2 months on campus, it was just not enough to have known you, so yes, let's please go on another trip soon.  

It amazes me how expressive you are emotionally and honestly, it's because of you that I have been able to normalize the same in my head. Strangely, I have felt extremely comfortable sharing with you, and a lot more amazing discussions await when we meet next. 

Should have gone on a date when we had the chance man.  
Hugs and kisses. XD  
And we owe it a second attempt, okay? 

 Love you, love you, love you! ",Anshika  Verma,True,60cfb406659165b3aa646916,Avisha
11,"To the Girl Next Door, as “no deewar could keep us far”. How did we even have a leg injury in the same leg at the same time? Glad for the time when I could skip PE with you. That specific knock-knock call of ours saved us some shouts there. Going to the canteen at what? 1:50 am since aj toh night out hai. Also, why have we watched such absurd movies together? Legally Blonde, My Cousin Rachel!! Should have just watched FRIENDS instead xD 

B204 had a vibe, from setting up those wall posters to drinking together. Thanks for getting rid of that lizard and in return I did the honors of scaring away those spiders. 

We have shared a mutual love for Forever 21(budget zyada nahi hai apna xD). However, we still need to twin in a black bodycon to a club together. ",Anshika  Verma,True,60cf98e4659165b3aa6468e3,Dishaa  Rajora
12,"Haaye Garmi! 

Thanks for your constant meme support on Instagram that I am well and alive during the pandemic. That stay with you at the airport was the longest we had stayed together, and I was surprised to know how we think about certain things in such a similar manner. And then 400 k noodles on the flight wtf.  Also, Marvel ka naya trailer dekha??

13,"Kushagra, 

Would not have survived the Morjim beach waves without you. We have to go on a walk together and not like the one in Goa. That is the strangest walk session I have ever had. A walk to remember for sure. Got to know you up close in Goa and I must say gaadi chalana nahi ata hai tujhe. Who gives an indicator on a road with no turns?. The black sheep bistro ghee roast pork was the best. Tried a little visibly too hard to get you on our South Goa camp, need to work on some acting skills, lol. The bhand you is inspirational and it's sad that our Bombay Sapphire party planning committee was a major failure. I had no idea that getting high on high fever is a thing xD. Back on campus, our attempt to scare that group from OAT to Mamma Mio when high, devising a plan to kick some ass there, tells me that we have good potential to make more kick-ass plans. 

We have an amazing meet-up story that cracks me up every time I talk about it. Got to know you better a little too late. You are an amazing person to be around. You have always been so warm, welcoming, and wholesome. Stay in touch. More daaru sessions together when in town.  

How about some part-time dance gigs? Light it up!

15,"Manisha,
I have tried waking you up once but of course, you don’t know because you never got up, that was ages ago and I have never tried to pull off that stunt again. 

You have always been such a warm person to talk to. At times when I was disturbed and didn’t really want to talk about it, I would find myself knocking at your door for some ""random"" discussions which would turn my day around.

So, Kalpana Chawla died in Chandrayan! I still can't believe how Gouthama did not read that out loud in class. Big Save! And then there were those famous alarm tones which had absolutely zero role in waking you up, so I did that. It was nice seeing you get drunk on 2 drops of whisky. After those last-minute lab assignments with you, 100s of rants on Vishal Agarwal, I am glad this was with you.

You must really know how much I hate KD water as obviously you came to the rescue with the Hall 2 RO water. Thanks for quenching my unreasonable thirst for RO water. Not so glad that a game of 3-2-5 made you declare that ‘Anshika has no heart’. 

Also, I am extremely careful while cycling, especially at turns.

Also, 4 am maal supplies k liye pehla call tujhe hi jayega hamesha. Video calls just to irritate the hell out of each other have worked well so far, aage bhi continue hona chahiye. Campus mein nahi mil paaye, will feel bad for it. That 10 am phone call gyaan session was not just a random call, I had really been meaning to tell you that I don’t care what location you got or how many times does one practically meet after college, you are important. Devised that farzi Delhi layover strategy during that conversation, hehe. Abhi to regular RR kiya hai, bhand hokar bhi karna hai. 

Kitna sell kiya tha tune Haunting of the Hill House and I like the show so much now that I have forced 3 other people to watch it. (Not your regular Pyramid Scheme) 

Thank you for the Assignment supplies even when you were that busy.

I am also amazed at not killing you on the hall 6 rooftop that night. It was so hilarious and scary at the same time. 

Thanks for the little music room adventure, although I was a bit zoned out, it was a fun discussion. Our mutual love for Hyderabadi Biryani, a flop H&M model pose, getting your 3rd person perspective on the weirdest argument ever, the last campus night out on Hall 6 rooftop, your Temperature character, hilarious mess table stories, discovering all of this in the last couple of months just makes me go ""why didn’t we meet earlier?"". 

Ah and your rings be so cute. 

You can blame me for that  ""Mera itna life kharaab ho gaya"" for life. XD 
Take care and see you soon. ",Anshika  Verma,True,60cf9d29659165b3aa6468fa,Swadha  Pandey
21,"Hi Baheti,
Cheers to all the unfinished discussions, late-night walks, and reminiscing amazing rooftop stories. The trek back on the railway tracks in Goa was like the first story session with you. You tell stories with the greatest passion. We have talked about Mafia strategies, lol. Sweep and your glittery cards in CCD were fun. Also, need to know more about that value system. That argument in Goa over who will be riding pillion with Avisha though. 

And, Captain America >>> Iron Man

See you in Gurgaon, excited for some weird-ass discussions over water, or maybe I will convince you for a drink, who knows. Will always be ready to discuss more crime and gambling and Marvel movies with you. ",Anshika  Verma,True,60cf9f50659165b3aa646901,Yash  Baheti
