39,"Yo Baheti!

Thanks for having my back during the intern :p

You are one of the best all-rounder and a passionate person I have met on our campus. You do/know everything that a perfect person is expected to do/know xD. (We will come to the job part later :P). And that's very rare and awesome Bhai. Always keep that up.

I have seen your life/habits closely and thus I admire your life/habits ethic a lot. You are an asset to any company you work with and that's why it wasn't a surprise for me when you got selected, actually, I too applied kyuki mujhe maloom tha ki tera ho jaayega and main waha akela reh jaata :p

It has been really fun discussing everything from assignments to lectures to JIRAs to ITRs to Interviews to Investing. And I have learned a lot from you in the process.

Btw, tune notice kar hi liya hoga 😜  thanks for giving me a template as to what to write again 😂. thoda original add-on 🤪  I have learned quite well from you on how to apply psychological concepts to real-life though I am not and may never be as daring as you while applying them 😜. Am trying to practice some ""perfect person"" habits inspired by you, lets see how it goes 😛  Baaki tu toh hoga hi guide karne (humesha?) 😁 🤗. And this is cent percent true that if there would have been an award as to perfect person overall, then you would have been a winner with perfect CPI to Startups to creativity to work/life balance to life experiences and everything!! Next Bill Gates? Nah, Yash Baheti will have its own legendary!! 🤩. 

Milte hai jald hi. :D
