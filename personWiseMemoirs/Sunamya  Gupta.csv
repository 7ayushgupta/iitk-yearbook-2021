0,"Thank God I met you and that too in the first year !! Do you even know how much I relate to you and how easy it is to be my original self around you. Thanks for being the person who always makes me feel at home <3. Remember the elaborate discussions we had at OAT and do you still remember the club we formed (let it remain a secret though)? Going to literally every fest together, going for most of the quizzes, lectures and labs together and definitely going to canteens together. Ye sab moments were enough to cheer me up for the day. I miss those days so much.
We shared so so many moments together and I love each one of them jaise ki our canteen visits and our shared love for Special fry masala maggi and cold coffee. Har lecture se pehle tumhara mere liye wait krna, yaa lecture hall m always saving a seat for me  yaa cycle bhaga kar lecture hall se mess pahuchna so that breakfast naa miss ho jaaye, saath m movies dekhna after exams, enjoying so many fests together or simply just chilling in your room and what not !! Thanks a lot for being the person I could always hangout with ! Stay the really hard-working, awesome, caring and helpful person that you are !
P.S. Bahut photos bhej di tumne acche khaane ki, jald hi milte hai and and treat me with the tasty cakes and food you make. 
Lots of love !!

1,"Hey Archit !!
I seriously cannot describe in words my level of excitement jb I first met you in the TA lab when you told me that you were from my school and on top of that you knew me pehle se … I was so overwhelmed though you made me realize very soon after that it wasn't that big of a deal.. but for me it definitely was !!!
Baaki… you already know you are super cool and chilled out. You do so many things and then too you manage to excel at each one of those. 
Looking forward to more taar idhar taar udhar jaise times !!
Stay connected !

2,"Hey Ashutosh ! 
You are definitely one of the sweetest and kind-hearted person I’ve come across. I really admire your art and I request you to sharing it. That course and the project otherwise would’ve been a burden but thankfully I got to know some really nice people, you included. I still remember the stressful situation jb poora group was present in your room before “the presentation”. Those days huh !! Quite stressful but now its a great memory !
Stay connected and stay the same awesome person you are !

3,"Hey dost !
How do I even start ?  Lets rather call and discuss xD.
On a serious note, is there any topic that is yet to be discussed? Every conversation and interaction with you was and is and will always be so fun-filled and memorable. 
It is just so easy being myself with you. Well, that’s your talent I guess. You’re quite a resourceful and fun person to be with. Thanks for always being by my side whenever I needed help and showing up when no one else did. Though I’m glad that I got to know you but I wish we could’ve spent more time together in-person rather than on calls. 
That being said, I still seriously wish we are able to “schedule” our next call real soon. 

P.S. I can hear the train while writing this and that makes me smile. Hope you know why !? Well, I did try your proposed method and failed miserably in keeping track. That train event makes me jealous of your observational skills though. 

Looking forward to greater and better times and much more memories with you. Stay connected (It didn’t need to be said but still...)

Lots of love !!

4,"Samanvayak sahiba ! 
You are one of the most panic free person I’ve seen on campus. Bhale hi kitni deadlines ho, one can never see any tension on your face and I guess that is the secret to your acing every one of those situations.  Remember those assignment sessions in your room, while we were all busy completing the assignments, you were taking a nap ( kaafi chilled out indeed !). Be it studying for an exam just the night before and then scoring the highest in it or handling so many responsibilities at the same time, you manage everything so well. Haa bss raaste nhi yaad hote tumse lecture halls k, but don’t worry next year rahungi tumhare saath so that you don’t get lost xD. Goes without saying, thanks for helping me survive chemical engineering. Oh and did I tell you, I really loved your “perfect for kesh king advertisement” wale baal !
P.S. Keep recommending me good songs (Remembers Genius and how you introduced me to it) xD.
P.P.S Keep sending great WhatsApp stickers like you always do !
Lots of love,
Sunamya

5,"I really wish we had interacted more during the time we were on campus. But anyways the time that we spent on calls this sem makes it even ! You are a really soft-spoken person and very hard-working too !! Thanks for making me do the assignments on time though, warna I toh  would have missed many deadlines. 
Stay the same and stay connected and hope we do more courses together !!

6,"Aur, kaise ho ?
I still remember the first time I met you. Do you ?
Definitely the most chilled out person who can handle every situation so beautifully. Though we met quite late, but still I feel lucky that I know a person like you. The way you care for your friends and practically every person who needs help, your kind nature, attitude of never giving up, managing so many things at the same time, all add up to make the Ashish that I know today. Remember how we used to do the simulation assignments at NCL just before the deadline and still take out some time to go for lunch together xD. Watching movies, standups, and even studying the night before exams was all so fun because of you !
Remember how you used to ask me to teach you but ultimately you ended up teaching me stuff  - that’s the height of your chapuness.
I really admire the smile on your face and the spark in your eyes whenever you talk about Prayas and how much you love the kids there. 
Thanks for being the kind-hearted, super helpful, selfless and positive person that you are. Always stay the same - happy, hard working, chilled out and haa keep making more and more cool animations !!
Be my host forever (and chacha to the others...lol).
Stay in touch.

Lots of love,

I really liked your long hair until I saw you with short hair. You look great either way. And you’re an equally good person at heart too !!
Sorry for the alarms though !
All the best for your future !!

8,"“Jee”shaan,

I am so so glad that we met and for that the credit definitely goes to Vishal sir. The only good thing that came out of that simulation course was that I gained some really good friends (you included obviously). From having the impression that you’re quite a serious and studious person, to actually knowing what an incredibly fascinating and fun loving (who loves pulling pranks) and hard working and strong-willed human being you really are, we have definitely come a long way. All those long walks, canteen trips, extensive discussions where you were the one doing most of the talking (and I was happy listening) and many more such memories that I can’t possibly list down here, will all always be cherished. 
Well, your PJs, academic rona dhona, messed up logics and a dozen more cringe things that you (and I both) fail to recall, definitely struck a chord in my symphony and so you better do that all over again. Glad we have one more year for that !
P.S. You are one of the ‘sabse sahi’ people I’ve ever met.
P.P.S. I still won’t forgive you for pulling that prank on me (hmmph).

We’ll definitely keep in touch (read as - we'll keep irritating each other) Zee !

Lots of love,
Sunamya.

You are a really down to earth person who is forever ready to help !!
The TRC course was quite fun doing with you and the hotel shhh team. 
Thanks for helping me decide which courses to go for in batti. Hope we meet again someday.
Stay the same and stay connected.

10,"You’re one of the cutest and sweetest people I know of !
We did so many courses together and it was always great doing those with you, especially the TRC one. It was so much fun doing that skit and also that project (remember shhhhh...). All those practices in the foyer and the lecture hall and all the weird ideas we had for the skit made it more enjoyable and memorable. Btw, I know Riverdale might have some super weird plot twists and all, but lets have faith and hope for the best.
Also, those whatsapp chats done on your notebook helped me stay up during the classes, so thanks for that. 
Stay connected and stay the awesome chaapu person you are !

11,"Hey Prajwal !
For me, ours was quite an unexpected sort of friendship !
We met at the CC, because we both went to CC almost daily and yet didn’t know each other’s name. Well, proper interaction toh kaafi baad m hua but I am glad that I got to know you. Though outwardly a very serious person, you actually are a quite fun-loving, enthusiastic person and a friend who is always ready to help when needed. Thanks for making Diwali at Campus so memorable for me. It was definitely one of the highlights of my stay here. 
P.S I still remember how amazed I was when you showed me your  juggling skills and that too in so many styles ( I also thank god that none of my things broke that day).
Stay the happy and hard-working person that you are and stay connected !! 
Hope we meet soon !

12,"Yo !
I seriously don’t know how I’d have survived batti courses without you. No quiz or exam seems complete until we spend an hour ranting about the stupid paper, the weird prof and the practically irrelevant course. Thanks to you for being the person who makes things happen in DAPS, be it a call or a game. 
I met you by pure chance, coz hum dono hi are of the “want to talk a lot but maybe would not ” type people. But I’m glad I came to know you! We got to do so many Chemical labs together though not in the same group but same day so we did get to interact a lot because of that. All the CC canteen trips for breakfast after the 210 class or preparing for eso 205 viva on the ground in the sunny afternoons of the otherwise chilly winters were all so memorable. Hope we get to do that more in the coming year !!   

Btw, cats are soo cool naa ? I totally get that now. 
P.S. I am hopeful that you will get over chappals some day (hope you get the context lol).

Lots of love !!

ESC201 lab toh bss tumhari wajah se ho paayi meri warna I’m pretty sure ki naa koi TA kabhi aata and naa hume kuch smjh aata kabhi ki karna kya hai. It was nice being clueless together.

Been hearing this line since first year and still not tired of it!!
Well, I’m definitely thankful that I asked for that eraser from you in Chem lab. ESC lab also wouldn’t have been possible without you. Thanks for being a part of my journey since the first year. Itni mehnat krte ho yet uska credit nhi lete, hope you realize soon that things just don’t happen, you work really hard to make them happen. And hope you’ll find a solution to most of the problems that bother you. You’ll always be my go-to person for any batti related doubts. Those long walks with really long discussions will always remain a special part of our memories. Remember those times in the library before exams, we had different subjects yet we studied together xD. Aur haa, ab toh rona kam krdo, though I guess hum dono ki common problem hai ye but tum jaada rote ho ye maan lo !
At last, all the very best for the new chapter of your life. Always be the hard-working and chaapu person you are and do stay in touch! Hope tum bhi higher studies k liye jaao !
P.S. Just a reminder that abhi bahut treats bachi hai tumhari, so don’t forget.
