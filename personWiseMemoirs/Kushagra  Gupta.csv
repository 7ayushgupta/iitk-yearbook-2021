0,"I remember the first walk I had in IITK, it was with you, figuring out the way to the airstrip. Tabhi se feel aa gayi thi ki bohot genuine banda hai, and this is the kind of people I want to meet here. It's been a long journey since, one that I've had the privilege to share with you. We've shared goals, dreams and ambitions, but the thing I'll remember the most is being able to share the truth with you. You may not think of it as much, but genuinely bohot kam log milte hai jinnke sath you can actually be yourself. I believe in you bhai, you just need to build the same confidence in you about yourself. Math ka RR to hum dono hi bhoolna chahte hai, so I won't recollect that here. What I want to cherish is our shared aspirations, our countless efforts chasing it and our shared dreams which we're going to achieve sooner rather than later.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60a3df56819323d199d47fb8,Aakash  Khandelwal
1,"Bhai! Can't even begin, or hope to capture the moments I've shared with you, yearbook mei itni capacity hi nahi hai. College ki pehli daru se leke akhri tak (I made it a point not to drink after you left), canteen ke kebab parantha se leke Goa ke kaju tak, first year ke kattapa se leke...kattapa to tu abhi bhi hai XD, college ke some of the best experiences I've had the privilege of living with you. I'm terribly poor at first impressions, but thank god I was right about you, you bright bundle of positive energy. Even though NN was making us laugh, you've been the one to make me smile. In some of my darkest times in IITK, teri koi faltu bakchodi ya impossible plan was enough to remind me what's good in life, a random visit to your room was enough to remind me ki jitna bhi haggu I'll always have the best place to return to. Honestly, you've been the glue to our group, wo fevicol ka jod jo dosti jodta chala gaya. If I use the IITK lingo of bhai in it's truest sense, you shine as the best example of it. If ever you need me, if ever you make a plan, count me in, cause it's not about the place, it's about the people ( ;) ). This is not goodbye!

2,"Smartest person on campus, hands down (I include the profs too XD)! With that out of the way, thanks for all the memories and support man! I really appreciate it. I can't think of any other person to share the coordiship of Pclub with, and if it wasn't for times when we had to just grind thorugh it, the club would've failed. You've been the best coordinator the club has seen, atleast in my eyes (and that's a big compliment given the history). But you go way beyond that, I've always been in awe whenever I've worked with you, be it competing in Inter IIT, discussing topics people will understand only after 150 years, working through making problems or lectures, designing a Tshirt or even simply playing board games. I've always felt a certain ease when hanging out with you, and maybe that's why it was special for me. I'll cherish our talks cycling to and fro to RM, movie screening and board games in astro club, our discussions (literally everywhere), our 'trip' to Bombay, shared lunches and dinners (pizzas have never tasted the same outside Sandy's room) and most importantly, everything I've learnt from you.

3,"Bsdk! Sorry, couldn't start your memoir without this. Let me start this memoir with an apology you deserve, tu humara personal punching bag tha but you stood strong through all of it. Can't think of a more fun or interesting person I've ever met, or imagine college life being what is was without you! And honestly speaking, you're one of the few people I cherish the most meeting here, so definitely US to leke jaa raha hu tujhe bhale hi bag mei bharke leke jana pade...can't imagine life being fun without you being in it. We all know tu bohot hi zyada smart hai, but what I want to talk about is how supportive and good-hearted you've been. Thode matlabi to sab hote hai XD, but the effort I've seen you putting for others (man it goes way beyond giving coding tests for others) is astonishing. Although life ki practicality mei kafi hagga hai tune (kabhi bag cinema hall mei bhoolna, kabhi phone, and wallet and ID card to bhagwan jane kaha hai)...but the way you've conducted your four years here, from your ideology towards it to your logic for living it, are closest to perfection. Your strength of character is astounding, jitne mazze humne tere liye I can't think of anyone else who could have faced it with a smile, and still be the buzzing, brilliant happy-feet. Know this for a fact mate that jitna devotion and dedication tune apni friendship mei dikhaya hai for all of us, utna hi hum bhi reciprocate karte hai tere liye. 'Aap -aap' karte hue 4 saal to nikal hi liye tune, ab Google bhi jaa raha hai..you're well on track on your plan to be the next CEO xd. Even after all our first year debates, fight club brawls and fifa el clasico's, you're the first person I would stand up for on campus. Although first year mei humne tujhe duniyadari sikhane ka try kiya ho, I will say this..never change.

You're one of the most fun people to have a conversation with and a really cool person to hang out with (even the sober me agrees). We've shared loads of stuff, from our branch, halls, debates and Vox to bongs, our love for beef, hijacking trains, sutte and drunkard dance steps. Convocation in Goa was extremely fun minister! And I'm thrilled to have had you as my Hobbes. It sometimes feels like you're one of the most wrongly judged people in hall 2, but I feel like I know you much better now, having shared a convocation at Goa and a very tipsy return to college.

5,"King of all trades man! IITK ka sabse talented banda hands down! I only really met you in 2021, but the fact that I've come to appreciate so much about you in such a short time speaks tons about your sheer brilliance. Masterchef Goa, Kanpur ka Da Vinci, Senna of SAE and a really sweet person. Thank you for introducing me to F1 mate. I'll forever cherish our memories in Goa..Hemant ki shadi, hijacking trains, almost being arrested, swimming with the fishes, living dangerously on Goa roads, impossible dark room games, perfect snacks and coffee, the best rum after a long trek..the list is endless.

I'll never forget our beginning in Antaragni, but what followed was more than memorable.

7,"Pranam prabhu! Aapki aarti likhte likhte memoir pe aa gaye hai. From literally seeking your blessings before exams in the first sem to the final hug before leaving IITK, you've been an integral part of my stay at IITK. You are the person I respect the most in IITK, and it never fails to amaze me how you always know the right thing to do, whatever the situation might be. I honestly wouldn't have believed that a perfect blend of understanding, smartness, kindness, courage, fun, wit, creativity, charm, humour, insight, personability, confidence, empathy, adventure (running out of adjectives here) could have existed, but you proved me wrong. From our first interaction on the mess table in the first sem to goodbyes of the last month, I knew I was talking to someone special. You've always been the strength of the group (including fight club XD) while also being the most comforting presence with an easy and charming laugh.  We have often shared moments of understanding, where a slight of the eye or a mid-sentence pause or a passing reference communicated what words could not, and the fact you could do this with anyone is a one in billion quality (and so are you!). I'll admit it, I was a little envious of you initially, but that quickly changed into awe, love and respect. You've been a constant inspiration for me, and I owe a lot of my transformation at IITK to learning from you. After all, who better to model yourself from than a guy who's seemingly perfect at everything. Your friendship means a lot to me, and one of the few times I've felt the freedom to be my genuine self have been while talking to you. Thank you for listening to me and accepting me during those times, I hope I can someday explain how important those moments have been. Bhoolne ka to sawal hi nahi uthta, I'm never finding anyone like you anywhere I may travel. All the best for your future mate, know that someone will always be in your corner whatever the situation (I've learnt this from the best ;) ).",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60bfdfe6659165b3aa645149,Anany  Sharma
8,"Hello the-person-I-regret-not-interacting-more-with XD. I'll take this memoir to express my appreciation and gratitude, something which I may never have done but something you definitely deserve. You're one of the most good-hearted, understanding, caring, and hardworking people I've had the privilege to meet. Even though we never got to have night out walks or heart-to-heart conversations, I've always found your presence to be comforting, and I've always felt like I can talk to you about anything. I guess you can call it friendship at first sight XD. Our memories go far and scattered across four years, but what I'll remember you is watching you being the best person in IITK. I'll remember walking into Abhishek's room and finding you consoling him, or meeting you outside CCD being a great friend to Ankit, or always being there for Hemant, and these are the moments that have defined you for me. You inspire me with your dedication to go that extra mile for things you care about, be it your friends or CWC or simply your point of view. You've always been supportive of me, and encouragement from you is extra sweet because I know it's coming from an amazing person. If it were up to meet and the rules permitted, I'd nominate you for every Gymkhana award there is.  We still have time before we get busy with life outside IITK, we'll do everything we missed on our next trip. 

P.S. - I hope the shirt reminds you of our friendship.

It's been awesome being one of the six rational people in debate rooms with you, watching your incredible journey to become one of the best we have to offer (also, beating Arnav in NUJS was oh so satisfying). You had some great ideas for the club, and I would've loved to see them become a reality. You've had a roller coaster of a journey at IITK, and I'm glad to have shared some of its highs (quite literal highs, bhand Ojha iz da best [1][2][3][4]). But despite all your antics, the dedicated and diligent Ojha is a force to be reckoned with. I've been a huge fan of your 'that's what your mommy said' moments, and your wise-ass one-liners crack me up every time.

I'll remember you for the late-night winter camp sessions (and yashsriv giving me your messenger nickname), NYO discussions on turtle porn, pizza parties on a train to Mumbai, getting robbed of shrimps by IITB fachhas, collecting chillar while singing in antaragni, anti bong movement in German classes, the one debate I was able to drag you to, riding the highs and lows of a difficult coordinatorship, and the 'very formal' tea parties.

I've only recently come to discover how wonderful a person you are, and I'm happy for the times we got to spend together in 2021. Our walk in Goa wasn't exactly how I thought it would be, but I guess that goes for our friendship too. We've come a long way, from ignoring each other in chem lab to trying to extend our shared stay in Goa (thankfully not with the police). I don't care what anyone thinks, but I got the best gift in secret Santa because has the force with her my Santa. Cheers to our shared highs -- from moping the OAT stage on Holi to practically drowning in Mama-Mio shakes to almost breaking the first floor with our killer dance moves in Goa.

Listening to you talk about Deep Dream motivated me to make a dream of my own. I knew that you were brilliant from the winter-camp (first sem se to chaap hi raha hai, your gradient ascent learning rate is not a number), and I only expected that you would ace it in the end. Discussing ML related stuff (yeah, most of it was one way with you pouring knowledge) was super fun, and left me wanting to work more after I could close my mouth from awe. But despite being one of the most chapu people I've ever met, thanks for always being available for help (CS 698 plag reacts only). Your stellar career is well matched by your humble self.

20,"Hey :). Writing this memoir brings back a rush of memories, and I can't decide whether to be happy about having shared them or be sad that our journey at IITK is coming to an end. It almost makes me want to just be quiet, with a sly smile on my face while my mind churns at a hundred memories per minute. But I won't do that, for you've made me see otherwise. We've been friends for a long time now, so much so that we can't even remember how and where we started. It feels like you just eased into my life at some point and have been an essential cog in it ever since, and I find that fitting. Although our friendship has had its fair share of explosive moments, the experiences I cherish the most are the seamless conversations where your thoughts fit in perfect harmony with mine, where filters on my thoughts did not seem necessary for the first time in my life, where I helplessly ended up laying myself bare, and where I finally learnt to value myself as a person. The surge of emotions I've felt with you is something exceptional, from a sudden rush of heartbeat when we shared secrets I did not think my tongue would ever taste, to heartwrenching lulls when we reached an impasse. No experience with you was ordinary, for the connection we've shared is extraordinary. I may have already expressed my appreciation, but lest the future-you forget, you're a gem of a person, perhaps the best I've met in the last four years. 

If people see a friend in you, know that they see an image of the best of us. If people have walked away during the journey, maybe they just couldn't keep up with your brilliant best. Perhaps they realised that they could never reciprocate your dedication as a friend, and perhaps they knew that they do not deserve you and were too afraid to admit it. Even I've had difficulty coping up sometimes, wondering if I deserve someone as perfect as you, but afraid to forego what your friendship meant at the same time. I know that I haven't been the easiest person at all times, sometimes even exasperating myself over what I've done. Our numerous fights, debates and breaks (sometimes not so little) in friendship bear testament to that. Thank you for always being the bigger person through these times, for trusting in the best of me even when my actions brought out the worst in me. Sanderson has taught me a lot about the value of trust, and in you, I've seen this virtue come to life and blossom. 

You know better than most about some of my difficult moments in IITK (and your role in it! JK), but I think it's essential for you to realise your role (knowing or unknowing) in helping me overcome it too. During my 'revival' (shall we say), I've often wondered how Avisha would react to a situation, and more often than not, that has landed me at the right decision, or rather, a decision I was happy with. You've pushed me to be the best version of myself, and that has transformed me in ways that were unimaginable to me for the longest time, yet ways I had always yearned for. It's one of the greatest gifts I could've asked for, helping me in my fight against the silly thoughts in the back of my head, and giving me an anchor when everything was slipping away.  I think you realise how important that has been for me, and I hope that conveys how much I value you. When people acknowledge the change I've gone through, or appreciate me for being a good friend, know that I silently thank you for showing me the way.

I realise I've been droning on for a page without ever really beginning your memoir. I wanted to make it a grand gesture to thank you for everything and summarise our journey, but I realise we've never really been about grand gestures. It's always been the small things that made you stand out among the riches of wonderful people at IITK. Your weird questions in the middle of a serious conversation [1], your cat-like sneer at my idiosyncrasies [2], your excitement about little things [3], your intimate knowledge about every nook and cranny of IITK [4], and your insistent hatred for dogs [5] coupled with how easy you make talking about the most difficult of things, your infinite patience and willingness to give second chances, a level of maturity and strength of character that well exceeds your age, the faith upon which I could share anything with you, and your commitment to trust and understanding was just what I needed in a friend. Not grand gestures, but a continuous adherence to these virtues have nurtured our friendship, and that's what I'll commemorate it with. I'll admit I've been a bit clandestine with the memoir (neither the world nor I am ready for it yet), but I think you'll read between the lines (you always do). I don't know if I've come close to do justice to what I wanted to say, but I know that our conversations have.

21,"In case you've hidden the original certificate XD - 
This certificate is hereby issued in appreciation of the prolonged strange, erratic and otherwise twisted behaviour of Ayush Agarwal. Ayush has always been conscious of the environment, leading the 'khulle mei hagna band karo' campaign in IITK and going as far as dressing campus dogs with diapers. His social initiatives have been a constant source of inspiration, with his efforts to iron S Ghorai’s pants every day in MTH102 even prompting the teacher to wear the same pants daily (unwashed mind you). As a ‘responsible’ citizen of India, he made 69 arrests on valentine’s day with the ‘anti-Romeo squad’. He even volunteered as a day labourer for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Ayush has been an active resident of the campus, he bought the most Bournvita from DOSA and used it to run the ‘I’m a Complan boy’ campaign. We will never forget his efforts in eliminating the national threat of Akash Anand’s pet birds and his generous donation of hair on Word Blood Donor day. His achievements in writing the best Hindi ‘nibandh’ in ELS poetry slam and the national record he set for treating cycle punctures have made him immortal in the annals of history. Ayush has made an indelible impact on numerous young minds with his ‘Kalbelia’ performance in Y18 orientation and his famous debate sessions on ‘Mayawati vs Chhipkali’. His research output for the institute is invaluable, with his latest experiment on producing mutant ‘nilgai’ called ‘piligai’ (by painting them yellow, naturally) creating ripples in the scientific community. Ayush has consistently shown absurd behaviour, throughout his comical tenure at IITK, and this certificate commemorates his madness.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c9a145659165b3aa64630e,Ayush  Agarwal
22,"Ok, this is probably the toughest memoir I've had to write. The reason (which I'm sure you'll guess without me writing it) is simple, you know so much of what I'm thinking before I say it, understanding exactly where I'm coming from that I feel as baffled as GJ in a stats class when faced with a task to pen it down finally. Nonetheless, I'll try my best and trust you to follow the unsaid. I feel like I've met a different Ayush from what I've heard about, and I'm not talking about just the stuff that comes to mind first. I don't think that a lot of people understand you as a person (I lay no claim to the same), for I've known you to be as good a listener as Medha, as supportive as GJ, as heart-warming as Ananya, as understanding as Avisha and as easy to talk to as Dootika in your unique way. I'm glad to have experienced these different facets of you and still recognize a vibe unique to you, and man, does that speak of character! 

We share so much of our academic journey at IITK - crying over pure math courses, sharing seats in every class, figuring out Veritas on blackboards, solving late-night stats assignments, and conspiring over google docs in the online semesters. Attending classes was never the same without our constant whispers, without you teaching me a secondary lecture in parallel with the professors. So it's not a coincidence that the rise in my performance concurs with spending more time in your company. Couple this with our random walks around RM, exchange of ideas and music over chat and in-person, that one crazy special kulfi, stealing your hat from your room, and ultimate frisbee in the rains of Goa, and we have the foundation for a remarkable friendship. But what made it extraordinary was the connection I developed over these moments on so many levels, to the extent that you can finish my sentences and mirror my thoughts (those double and triple jinxes bear testimony). We've never had any significant friendship defining moments, but finding each other in our routine was implicitly doing that throughout our journey. Maybe that's why your friendship is so special to me, or perhaps it's the fact that I could see an impression of myself in you, significantly different in many ways and yet so similar. Maybe that's why I relish watching you succeed as much as I enjoy my triumphs, and why if it were anyone else who got into GSoC instead of me, it would have hurt. 

That last day in Goa was amazing, and I'm glad you asked me to stay when everyone else wanted me to go with them. Underlying this, I'm grateful for finally finding acceptance, for having found a niche with you, Medha and GJ after wandering for so long. Chilling on Curlies in Anjuna, that dark room cum pakdam-pakdai, letting our imagination run amok on trippy windowpanes, I would gladly stop time at any of these moments and live them for eternity. I honestly can't think of the best way to end this memoir (because it's not the end?, or perhaps I don't want anything related to our friendship to end), so I'll trust you to figure out how I would want it to end.

I honestly can't think of the best way to end this memoir (because it's not the end?, or perhaps I don't want anything related to our friendship to end), so I'll trust you to figure out how I would want it to end.

It was really fun hanging out with you in our second year summers and watching you fanboying over Indian cricket XD. Although we didn't break in Delhi, I honestly enjoyed debating with you and Ojha. Thanks for always being there whenever I wanted to discuss anything. All the best for your future mate.

I respect you a lot for voicing your support for a cause and acting on it to make a difference. I think that's missing in many debaters, but you are an exception. Thanks a lot for introducing me to Medha and all the conversations I've shared with you. I still blame you for coming up with the nickname kushy (Inshu still calls me that), but it's a small price to pay for getting to know you.

Definitely one of the most fun people I've met, teri harkato se Medha ki chandangoh bhi sharma jaye.

Discussing anything and everything with you has been an awesome experience. Through these discussions, I've learned a lot from you, learnings going beyond simple arguments to a way of organizing my thoughts. From a novice whip to a master, it's been a pleasure sharing the debating stage with you, NUJS and beyond was a lot of fun. Thanks for starring in our win over Arnav and for coming to the debate at Hindu. Our frequent pilgrimages to Mocha (and even the virtual one) were special, and they helped me know you as a friend along with a debater. The poster boy of Debsoc, dog lover like no other, a masterful debater, someone quick to smile and a friend in need. Keep in touch, I'm looking forward to future discussions.

First of all, thank you for helping me out in MTH, the surge in my mth grades is highly correlated with you helping me out with the tough ones (ji haan, hum jaise nadan balako ke liye tough the wo..abhi tak geometry nahi pata kya hai mujhe XD). Spending time in RM and astro club with you and Gulati had a lasting, serene quality to it because it just felt inexplicably right. No social pressures, annoying obligations, or a need to constantly filter what I'm saying..I was in my natural habitat when you both were around. Maybe that's why we had so much fun in simple things like cycling around the campus, screening movies in astro club, lounging in RM, sharing meals in Chick Blast (or in Sandy's room lol) or the not so simple (and extremely fun) 'trip' to IIT Bombay for inter IIT XD. BTW I didn't know you were a snack monster! RM third floor Bakarwadi, chowpati snacks on the beaches of Bombay, endless deliveries from zomato itna jata kaha hai? Maybe that super brain of yours requires constant fuel. US-Canada boundary kood ke visit karna, we'll always have a Disneyland ticket for you.

43,"Yo! Pehle to please don't kill me for some of the stuff I might write in this memoir, I don't want to be worried about knives in the night XD. I'm so glad that I finally got to share some treasured moments with you, and you aren't just Anany ki bandi, or Medha ki pagal dost, or the idiot who's rolling on the floor when drunk (I saw that happen, you cannot deny it!) anymore. 

I feel like people who do well in IITK need to be mentally tough, but I've met none as strong and resilient as you. It feels like you've been fighting and rebelling most of your life, and circumstances and people haven't exactly been kind to you (what an understatement!). But the blazing and brave Gunjan I see coming at the end of it is someone I deeply respect, someone with an inhuman strength of character, and someone who did not let the circumstances dictate her journey. I don't care what people say about you (and neither should you), their careless comments do not come close to the truth. I feel like I've had the privilege to experience the real you, and although it required some chipping, the gem in the oyster was that much special. And it was a privilege indeed! I truly am honoured by your trust in me, for considering me a friend worthy of those walks in the last month at IITK. 

I'm not exactly an emotional person, but I would be lying if I didn't feel my eyes turn wet that afternoon. You are one of the rare few I've poured a fraction of my heart to, that moment then was just too irresistible. It's a miracle really that I opened up so quickly, but I guess that speaks for you as a person. And that 'incident' in Goa! I can't think of many who would have continued to remain friends with me, lest forgive me after that. But your response to it was a hug, and that made me feel a little better that day, for I knew I had found a friend who'll always be in my corner. 

I share some of your concerns too silly, we all do. But we're just not brave enough to voice it, just not comfortable enough in our skin. I don't think you're someone who forgets when to stop talking, rather, you're someone who'll trust a friend blindly and pour your heart out to them, and I sincerely appreciate that (as I'm sure all your friends do). You don't need to filter your thoughts, or be mindful of your jokes or be wary of your actions with us. Because Gunjan, we get it, and we love you because and not despite of it. 

Well, I guess I can't end this memoir without thanking you for making my birthday extra special. You're one hell of a stalker, huh! I'm honestly scared now, I can't even think of offending you, for I like my head better on my shoulder rather than rolling as a football (no, you weren't speaking too loudly in Mama-Mio when you were high that day XD). But I genuinely cherish all the efforts you put in for it, it goes to show how much you care for your friends, and it made the desserts extra sweet on my birthday. I guess I'll end with a promise then, a promise to visit you every time I'm back in India until I change your mind and you settle in the US.

It's because you go way beyond the regular tickboxes of being a friend, and I feel like I can always rely on you. You bring a certain uniqueness (for lack of a better word) to any group, a breath of fresh air essential to complete any group. From being a frivolous bundle of energy lighting up faces to a thinker in deep thought, I've seen you be it all. I sincerely appreciate you confiding in me on our Goa trip, and am honoured to have you reward me with your trust.

I'm just talking about the smile though, you still need to work on your awkward leg poses XD. Riding through Goa has been amazing with you. Apologies for the last bumpy ride, but I'll make up for it with that white dress you spotted on the way to Morjim. It was amazing hijacking the aero farewell with you (sadly, it's the only one we could go to), but hey, convocation in Goa was amazing too. Congrats on finishing the Doodh Sagar trek first! Tees Maar Khan ke jungly kisse motivated you a lot apparently. Talking to you has always been fun, even if it's bitching about SNT or random RR.

You know what? medha.sunshine actually suits you, for you're that ray of happiness that can illuminate the darkest corners, ablaze with the light of a thousand splendid suns. You've got it all - a bundle of unbounded energy, antics like a chicken, serenity like the oceans of Goa, the craziness of Monjulika, the warmth of a dearest friend's hug, the lameness of...well, that's unmatched XD. Seeing you working on your research brings a smile to my face, it makes me feel like something is right in this world. Watching you dance makes the day a little brighter, for it feels like a soul revelling in pure joy. You are a treasure hidden from the world, my friend, and I can't wait to watch you explode in the US (hopefully, you won't slip from the stage this time XD).

I remember when you said that you wished I was a childhood friend, a substitute for that lanky neighbour you used to harass by locking him up with the animals. I wish for the same, because even if I have to be a baboon eating potatoes from your hand to be a friend, I think it will be worth it. I can understand that Chandan Goh now, agar kisi ka ghar hi itna interesting ho to anyone would be ready to face fireballs to watch the show. Oh, and what a show it has been! I'm sure people can make a movie from your childhood stories - Shinchan Bungle in the Jungle 2, starring kutkut and other cough-syrup high creatures from the zoo. But seriously, smashing people onto mirrors, chalk-high (sasta cocaine) kids from fiitjee, Takeshi Castle's skipping stones over gutters, live Balika Vadhu episodes, boy, does it get crazy in Meerut. Huh, seems like you're the sane person in your part of the town afterall. These stories have made so many moments with you memorable, I'll never forget the late-night talks in RM, chilling on the shacks of Anjuna, the night out where you explored the rooftops of IITK, and our insane chats which swallowed entire nights. But more importantly, I'll never forget how they brought me closer to you and laid the foundation for an unbelievable friendship. 

Our academic journey has been intertwined from the beginning, starting from searching for our first stats project together and (definitely not) ending at going to the best stats universities. Although you wouldn't let me speak in the COM presentation, and I would steal your notes and try to sell them, even a super competitive freak like me grew increasingly fond of your company. While we all know who to thank for the progress we've made over the last couple of years, you have undoubtedly played a vital role in inspiring me with your dedication, passion and pure brilliance. That one person I could always rely upon for helping me with a talk or mentor a project, can I just say that I'm extremely proud of your success, and can't think of anyone more deserving of everything you've achieved. A prodigy in the making, you've proved the doubters and haters wrong time and again, and I'm happy to concede the position of the best statistician of our batch to you (huh, Ayush and GJ were never in the running XD).

I think it's really nice to see how far being a genuine person can get you. Talking to you, I've always connected with the real Medha, and not a mask of pretence that so many of us have made a habit of wearing. If you think that makes you naive or vulnerable, know that it's also what made me believe in you in the first place. Talking to you comes naturally, and I've always found in you a sympathetic ear, free from the scorns of judgement. Although you are the butt of many of my jokes, you'll always be in my heart as one of my closest friends. Thank you for sharing all those memories.

Although you are the butt of many of my jokes, you'll always be in my heart as one of my closest friends. Thank you for sharing all those memories.

Pehle to please forgive me for the memoir I wrote..I've been writing for a long time now and I'm just exhausted and emotionally drained. I know there's no excuse to not write the best memoir for someone as amazing as you, and be sure that I will definitely make up for it in the US. I wish I had pinched myself and exhausted my tears, because your memoir has made my eyes very blurry for some reason. I've met a lot of wonderful people in IITK, but honestly, none like you. If you could see yourself from my eyes, you'd that you're one in a billion (nope, definitely rarer). I was stuck on a problem for the longest time while thinking of what to write for you - what is it that makes you so precious, that makes you that perfect friend? I still haven't found the answer. I've been friends with people longer, I've had life-changing moments and conversations with others too,  I've also poured my heart out to close friends, but it's just not the same, just not as special as it is with you. Ok, I've decided. There's just no logical explanation for it. You don't have to understand me the best, or mirror my thoughts, or always support me. As long as you're yourself, as long as we have all those memories behind us, you'll be a special friend. I've never doubted you once. Hell, I've been more confident in you than I've been in myself. I'm telling you there's something special about you, something heartwarming, something brilliant, something we don't have a word for! Your secrets are always safe with me, I can't even imagine breaking your trust. And I apologize in advance if ever my jokes hurt you, or I'm unable to reciprocate your love and care.

Maybe that's because they are always coming from the right place, or maybe because you are unabashed and pure of heart or maybe because we connect on some different level that we are yet to understand. Even though you haven't been with us from the start, you've undoubtedly become an indispensable part of our group, someone who completes us. One of the most dedicated and hardworking members of our batch, surely one of the best we have to offer. And this is not restricted to your work, where we know you're incredible, but extends to your friendships as well. Remember that day in our third year, jab Ram room mei akela baitha hua tha and we both were trying to get him to tell us the problem, or that party in Abhishek's room jab Srinivas mil nahi raha tha, or that night in antaragni where we left hall 6 together. In moments like these, I realised how lucky I am to have a friend like you—an absolut(e) gin(em). Although we share countless memories of cycling trips, Delhi parties, aero farewells, group chats, baby yoda tales, beer exchanges, politics (of both kinds), crazy final month parties (and hangovers) that I cherish, I can't seem to have enough of them.

It's a big feat that this respect comes primarily out of love, given all your blinding achievements. I've seen many people who pretend to be good, but none so kind and caring even when there's no spotlight to recognize everything they've done. But people do remember your kindness, and so do I, and maybe that's why they remember you as one of their closest friends. You might not remember it, but we met for the first time on the Bollywood night of our first year antaragni. We didn't know each other's name then, but something drew me towards you as I had the most fun swaying and dancing to the music.

102,"Yo LKT! Remember, daddy is always proud (insert image) XD. Bhai balti to bharni padegi, mai to bol raha hu upgrade karke bathtub kar dete hai. We just missed getting you in hall 2, but you've always been one of us. Maybe that's because you always brought a smile to our faces. Hoodie lace fight ki championship karenge! But iss baar apne glasses sambhal ke rakhiyo (sry for that XD). We've all found our niche in the conglomerate of IITK, but my journey wouldn't have been as much fun if you weren't a part of it. When I look back at my best memories of first year, I realise that they were extra special because of you. Thank you for being that dependable, genuine, good vibes, killer dancer (I remember the dance face-offs in first year XD) friend that brightens up any group. In the memory of all the good times, scarring Baldips since 2018!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60b73706659165b3aa644f53,Soumya  Gupta

104,"Hey! We don't have a lot of shared memories, but I've always had a very positive impression of you because of how highly Avisha and Priya regarded you. You're one of the brilliant minds IITK has to offer, and my favourite physicist because of your awesome taste in music (I know that makes no sense, but then again, neither did Physics :P). There's something about talking to you that's a lot of fun, and I wish I got the chance to have more conversations with you. Anyways, that night at RM was super fun, and I still can't help but smile at some of those stories. Mad respect for killing it in MTH and PHY courses, humse to ek nahi sambhal rahe the XD. Hopefully, we'll meet in the US.

P.S. - I was lying on chat that day, I'm definitely going to steal your best friend in Stanford XD. ",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60cf2580659165b3aa64658d,Swadha  Pandey
105,"Taare zameen par XD... IITK ka sabse 'special' bachha hai tu, and sabse fun bhi. People will remember you for all the times you've made them laugh, teri bakchodi world famous hai. But I'm glad to be one of the fortunate few to have witnessed your other side too. I remember my first late-night walk on campus, hum football field ke peeche chal rahe the and tab teri processing fast thi XD. You struck me as a highly sensible guy, but wo tere baap wing mei 2 kele dabane tak hi seemit tha. Just kidding, I've found that same Swapnil whenever I talk to you (even the conversation in Delhi just before coming to campus). Thanks for taking care of Yoda, you were like a parent to her, and she wouldn't have survived if not for you. Jitna bhi tu usse maar le I know tujhe wo bohot zyada pasand thi kyunki aise hi subah 4 baje uthke kisi random kutte ka dhyan nahi rakhta koi. Jitne mazze tune dilaye hai, uske aadha bhi koi kare to they'll say they had the best campus life..so thanks a lot for being the ever entertainer, college life wouldn't have been close to special without you in it. Jitni jaan fight club mei lagai hai, utni hi har jagah lagade koi rok nahi payega tujhe. There's a reason you have a special place in all our hearts, sath ki bakchodiya to theek hai but dil bohot saaf hai tera. I have always found a companion in you whenever I needed one, I hope I can be the same for you. Iss memoir me memories to nahi daal paya mai, aakhir hai hi itni sari and itni special that the only place where they can do justice is my heart. So let this be a memoir of gratitude, a token in front of everything you've done for me and for others. ",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60bbccb6659165b3aa644feb,Swapnil  Tripathi
106,"Hey man! That treasure hunt was a lot of fun because of you. I had a lot of fun whenever you were around, and thanks for helping us roll those joints on the final day of the quarantine (although kafi bhari padte padte bachi wo raat XD). I'm glad to have known you, all the best for the future.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60cf2601659165b3aa64658e,Swastik  Singhal
107,"Hey man! It's been a pleasure meeting you in IITK. I'll remember you for being that photography friend of Ankit's, and also for finding you to be a friendly presence. Unfortunately we couldn't photograph the stars from the airtstrip when Ankit and I came to your room, but that memory is still fun.

109,"Hey man! That Rishikesh trip was super fun because I met you. You're an extremely sweet person and super fun to hang out with. Also, you might not remember this but you almost convinced me to switch to Nokia 1100 during one of your bhand talks XD.

110,"Hey man! Thanks for fostering Yoda (or BKL as called affectionately or cookie, whatever) when we weren't there. The house you built for her was amazing. I had a great time whenever I randomly bumped into you and Gosai in the wings of hall 2. Glad to have known you mate, all the best for the future.

112,"Yo Jindal! Tera phone tempo se slip hone wala kand yaad rahega XD. Although tab bohot tension ho gayi thi, but in hindsight it'll surely be one of those things we laugh about in the future. Pata nahi track karke, konsi galiyo mei jaake, bewado se milke finally mila tha wo. Nonetheless, it's been a lot of fun partying with you in the last month mate, aakhri baar maal bhi apne hi fukaya. You're an incredible mix of sheer brilliance and hard work to go with it. Itne chhapu hoke bhi itni tension kyu lete ho sir, aise he lage rahe great things lie ahead. Hopefully, we can recreate F3 in the US. It's been a pleasure knowing you. ",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60cf692d659165b3aa64667c,Vaibhav  Jindal
113,"Hey man! Thanks for making NYO bearable, end mei aate hue to rona aa gaya tha. Ughh Beligum, those fuckers, har baar competition mei aake hagg dete hai. Anyways, I had a lot of fun wherever we met, be it the KD first floor lab, in the corridors of hall 12, or that train journey to Mumbai for inter IIT. Yep, for sure we are destined to meet in football match in Anfield, hopefully Chelsea will be crushing Liverpool XD (jk! You never know what Klopp's team is up to). It was great meeting you mate, that trip on the Vogon ship will be awesome, but in any case I've packed my towel.

114,"Yo! You're only human and not a robot, right? Sometimes your addiction, conviction and almost perversion for perfection is beyond comprehension XD. Haan bhai, yaha log tere level ke hi nahi hai XD, because you operate on a super-human level. I don't understand exactly how, but I know that you'll kill it at Tower while nailing your various start-ups at the same time. Well, maybe because it's you we're talking about. Goa trip was super fun mate, even though you were sober the entire time! Your chapuness aside (although I'd like to see anyone try to move the bulk of it), you are one of the sweetest people on campus. I remember our first interaction, we met in that CS food fest thingy and were cycling back to our halls. You noticed something wrong with my cycle, and immediately jumped off to fix it, and I thought, yeah, he's a nice guy :). Keep up your excellent work ethic and ambition man! Baki Baba ka ashirvad to hai hi apke yoga lessons ki wajah se. Can't wait to meet you again in the US, please invite me to your rooftop pool full of money.

P.S. Thanks a ton for the card, it brightened up my day.",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60c22feb659165b3aa645aa9,Yash  Baheti

Summer ke wo eco course ki harkate agar prof ko pata lagti to bada mazza aata academic senate mei XD (not really, prof hi gadha tha :P). It's been super fun bumping into you in hall 12 or during fests. All the best for the future mate!",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60cf2f58659165b3aa6465a8,Yash  Maheshwari
116,"Kothari baba ki jai! Yep, sabse pehle jadi-booti apne hi di thi and I've been a devout follower ever since XD. I honestly enjoy just listening to you talk post nirvana, hall 2 canteen mei gyan ki varsha have brought me a step closer to enlightenment. Jokes aside, you're one of the people I respect the most on campus, it's always seedhi-baat no bakwas with you. A man of integrity, a man of his word, someone who'll always answer when called upon, and a warm and friendly presence where ever we met. You're one of the few people who'll actually listen to a friend, and who won't hesitate to voice their honest opinion. Someone ready to go that extra mile for what they believe in, yet someone who'll respect the opinion of others. That's highly admirable. PClub was lucky to get a coordinator like you, and I was honoured to share the post with you. 

P.S. - I loved listening to your crazy stories from the US, and hopefully we'll get to re-create the 420 moments whenever we meet. ",Kushagra  Gupta,True,60cdccd0659165b3aa64640c,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
