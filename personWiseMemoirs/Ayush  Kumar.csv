Main legit C/D khaata saare courses mein agar tu nahi hota to. Tere baare mein kaafi suna tha class 10th se hi, and fiitjee mein kaafi hype bana rakhi thi logon ne tere baare mein. Main darta tha shuru mein tere se baat karne se kyunki teri alag hi level thi. Par college mein aake first interaction hua tere saath and laga ye to kaafi chill banda hai 😅. Apni aadhi jharkhand group tere hi wing mein thi isliye kaafi achchi dosti ho gayi sabse. Kaafi gaaliyan sunni padi hai tere se over the time for my weak GK and poor logical reasoning 😔, hope karta hun improve ho jaye dheere dheere. Mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai tune bed tod diya tha ek din but shivam and tumne milkar le li thi meri free ki 😥. And uske baad umang ke saath meri GK quiz 😓, pata nhi us video ka kya hua, hopefully hamesha ke liye delete ho gaya ho 😌. Kaafi saare assignments and bakaiti ki hai tere saath and kaafi maza aaya, subhajit sir ki chapter to top pe rahegi 😛. Codefundo, ICPC, Organization, OS, FinEco, ML sab cheez bhai-bhai ki tarah kiya hai humlogon ne. Bas ek hi cheez adhoori reh gayi, final sem ki chai and chill in the garden 😔, but hopefully gurgaon mein iski bhi time mil jayegi kabhi 😅. Baaki teri future ka to pata nahi, kaafi variable plan rehti hai teri (IAS, PhD, Quant, .... what's next? Management?) but jo bhi karega usme chaapega hi tu. All the best and hopefully jald hi milte hain!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,False,60b94520659165b3aa644f87,Abhyuday  Pandey

2,"Another chaapu, systems + OS expert, speed typer and one of the most honest person towards their work with an intense love for programming, optimization and efficiency. I am fortunate to have grokked through so many CSE courses, labs and assignments with you. I first met you in the ACA project group. There were two groups one who were using hanwen/go and the other using bazil/fuse for the project. I remember how both of us being the minority using bazel, collaborated to finish that unachievable task of building a FUSE filesystem 😅. Since then we have worked together on so many things starting from ESC201 Labs (yaad kar tere ko batti mein itna interest aa gaya tha ki tune batti ke major courses lene ke plans banaye the 😂) to Data mining, ENG467 and CS610. Though our conversations were mostly restricted to CS topics, it was mind-boggling to see how much you had to say about everything (not to mention the speed at which they were said 😛). If I ever started talking with you, my biggest concern used to be when it would stop 😛. Nevertheless you were always very outspoken, fun and energetic to talk with. I remember how you used to tell me ki 1st year mein tere kaafi courses chud gaye the, but wahan se tune kya U-turn maari hai and saare important CSE courses mein A* laake gadar chaapa hai. Kaafi hard-working hai tu and har chiz ki in-depth knowledge rakhta. Har baar tu sabse mushkil CSE course uthata tha and phir usme chaapta tha. Anyway, finishing this rant over here and wish you all the best for the future!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a8341d819323d199d4937e,Aniket  Sanghi

Abhi bhi regret hota tere saath team kyun nahi banayi icpc ke liye 😔. But anyway that phase is now over. Teri sabse distinct cheez jo yaad rahegi wo hai teri chilli potato ke saath true love!! Har saturday raat ke liye 2 packet pack kara ke le jata tha tu 😛. Tujhe dekh kar maine bhi try kiya tha ye par pata chala packet mein soft ho jati hai. Intern lagte samay and cancel hote samay dono time saath diya tune mera 😌. Anyway, keep on coding aryanc403!!",Ayush  Kumar,True,60ce5660659165b3aa64646b,Aryan  Choudhary

You were always the guy I used to get positive motivation from. Very active, sporty, always optimistic, always on time and always planning ahead is how I would describe you. You were always so punctual, that I used used to rely on you more than my alarm (remember all my wake-up texts on the night before each exam). From our random bulla sessions to our OS assignment hangouts to my last day photoshoot, all moments go into my memory-bag. I still remember the night when your laptop erased a full-day worth of OS code you had written and you still had the determination to write all of that again. We planned to hit the gym together so many times, but it never happened :(. I still hope that you go to the gym with me someday in the future or maybe at least teach me your basketball tactics :P. I wish you all the best for all your future endeavours, and no doubt you will succeed in whichever avenue you proceed. Hope to meet you soon!!",Ayush  Kumar,False,60a70f5e819323d199d491dd,Ayush Hitesh Soneria

Phir tere vegetarian jokes sunne milte the har jagah. Intern day 2 pe bhi tu mere saath tha and kaafi confidence mila tha tumlogon se, thanks uske liye. Phir eco mein madad ki tune, kaash tere saath makeup de diya hota 🥺. Last sem mein bhi kaafi maza aaya, badminton, frisbee, urban crave, OAT meetups and random photoshoot in LHC yaad rahegi mujhe.

Har samay saath raha tu, sukh dukh and har stressful season mein, and not to mention, last month to kaafi special raha tere saath, bas ek chiz adhoora reh gaya, tere saath high nahi hua 😔. Kaafi change ho gaya hai tu 4 saalon mein (except your beard jo abhi tak nahi aayi 😛). Mujhe yaad bhi nahi kaise mulaqaat hui hamari, bas itna yaad 1 sem ke baad hi hum sab bhai ho gaye the. Canteen ka chikken tikka masala tune hi bataya tha mujhe sabse pehle. Tu shayad mujhe chaapu samajhta hoga, par jitna tujhe lagta utna hun nahi mai, bas kisi tarah saare courses paar hui hai mujhse. In fact main to bilkul book choota tak nahi hun. Tu kaafi hard working and determined rehta hai hamesha, and ek baar jis par focus karta use achche se finish karta. Par tu sab chiz ke saath kaafi humble bhi hai. Mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai, humne 2 non-veg pizzas mangaye the, and usne galti se ek veg de diya tha but tune wo wala le liya. Tune kaafi chizon mein meri tips liye, but mujhe kabhi apne relationship tips nahi diye 😔. Also thanks ECO764 mein mere assignments and presentation karne ke liye. Chalo, all the best for your job (thora workout kar lena Bangalore jane ke pehle 😛), hope you succeed in all avenues you pursue.

Kaafi talented ho waise, singing + cricket continue karte rehna. Diwali tere saath manane ka mauka mila nahi kabhi, ghar bhaag jaata tha tu and main puchte rehta tha sabse gods kahan hain 😥.

9,"Another god and dassa king of IITK, you are one the smartest people and one with the most crisp sense of humor that I have known at IIT Kanpur. I was fortunate to get to do Codefundo with you and Abhyuday and then going for ICPC regionals together (we defnitely nailed our first attempt 😅) and then David's Auquan. You are the kind of guy who always has an elaborate plan for an apocalypse and will succeed at everything no matter how adverse the conditions are. Also thanks a lot for helping me out when I lost my 3rd year internship, you always have some of the best ideas to offer. I will always remember the times in class when you raised a completely out-of-the-box doubt baffling the professor as well 😛. Will definitely buy your book once it comes out into the market. And yeah, dogecoin is definitely not going to the moon 😔. Have a great time in the UK, and do invite us for a Europe tour!! ❤️",Ayush  Kumar,True,60a7c610819323d199d492bd,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
10,"Math God, Active Procrastinator, Pizza Lover, ChocoPie Distributor and what not!! You were my closest friend at IITK and my goto person for doubts, questions, random bulla, scientific/unscientific talk, help, enlightenment, imaginative theories, jokes, depression talk, w**d, or literally anything that a human could think of. There are so many memories we have together that it is hard to recall all of them. You started off as a quiet smart guy, but soon became our teacher in every course. I vividly remember the long tiring talk you gave on Goodstein's Theorem in the first year which none of us quite understood but it was still so fun listening to it. The canteen and pizza hangouts were my favourite. Pepper Barbecue Medium (plus an extra slice from my pizza), Maggi and Cheese Frankie was the the only thing you ever ate 😛. Your room was like an open theatre of knowledge. One could come in at any time of the night, and be certain to leave with a substantial amount of mathematical/philosophical knowledge 😛. 

You helping me to my feet when I was down was the norm, whether it was the Antaragni night when I was too hungover to walk, or the galaxy finals when I twisted my ankle hobbling down the stairs in excitement. It was hurtful to see your love for S***** P remain unconfessed 😥. It goes without saying that you are one of the smartest people I've met, and the most intense and profound math lover, the most surprising thing is how you achieve this with your god level last-minute decision-making skills (maybe procrastination is the solution to all our problems). Nothing can replace the awesome 4 years (minus 1 😓) I had with you.
