0,Tera phone uthane me har waqt dar lagta hai kyuki pata hai koi assignment hoga jo tu last minute mujse karwayega. Kaafi fun personality. Agar tu pura time sota na rehta toh shayad aur baat hui hoti. KD me baithke tera RR sunne me bahot maza aata tha. All the best for many more ENG courses,Keshav  Bansal,True,60a5a6fa819323d199d4875b,Abhijaat Ashish Kotamkar

Har cheez me chaapne ke baad bhi rota rehta hai.. tujhse zyaada over achieving insaan nhi dekha. Ek hi avice hai ki bas koi career chodh bhi dena humare liye. UPSC, MTEch, MS sab toh hi kar lega.. Favourite memory has to be you crying in Hall 1. Even after being connected to one of the most influential political families in Bareilly, you still are really down to earth.  Stay the same",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a599b9819323d199d48733,Akash  Gangwar
4,Most of our discussions were related how to do the bare minimum to get good marks in an assigment (cc Nishith and subhajit sir). I find you extremely intellectual and a person with very rational thought process.. and you used to make assignment deadlines a lot more fun for me. I still cant believ you got more marks in that cs252 assignment after copying my code :(.

6,"Didn't know you for three years.. the only thing that could possibly come out of that stupid david hackathon was getting to know you better.

PS: I really really wish you get that AirPods from Harsh haga",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a69176819323d199d490ea,Ayush  Kumar
7,"Teraa bahot RR suna hai pure 3-4 saal. Jab tere room aayo ya to tu so rha hota tha ya laptop ke saamne rota tha. One of the most intelligent people I know. Everyone I talk to you it becomes about a deep topic we both dont have any idea about. Talked to you a lot during the SOC thing. If left to you, our first website would have been named daddy issue. I still feel terko apni dukaan ke liye website bana leni chahiye the. Aur kya hi maanga tha teri family ne tujhse. Also do great things in the field of systems. love your passion about it.",Keshav  Bansal,False,60a5972e819323d199d48729,Ayush  Tharwani
8,Bhai. I had great fun talking to you about everything. Tu jis high level pe sochta hai assignment mein questions wo dekhke merko bahot stupid feel hota hai. I don't know if you remember but we sat together in the first PHY102 lecture at IITK. And to say the least the lecture went horrendous we found comfort in each other's inability to understand that thing.. All the best for everything in my life. I love your passion to achieve things in life. Stay in touch :),Keshav  Bansal,False,60a698ee819323d199d49115,Baldip Singh Bijlani
9,Dost max pro. First time baat hi shayad Psychology me hui this. Kya weirdcourse tha wo. Uske baad networks aur fir placement. Placement ke waqt toh tune hi depression see bachaya tha. From then defeating you In chess regularly has been one of my joys in life. I will keep taking investment advice from you. Tera roz ka 500 rupee kamane wala message dekhke bahot jalan hoti hai. Merko bhi sikha de.. Bhulna nhi ek algo trading company start karni hai. AND OTB.. khelna hai bhai.. ALso I will be waiting for the 8000 ka chessboard on my birthday. Dont forget,Keshav  Bansal,True,60a5a1ec819323d199d48747,Bhavy  Singh
10,"You were my constant partner at the front seat at Rm101.. even in those almost empty compilers and toc lectures.  When I jagga used to discuss and assignment and he told me devansh did this, I knew that was the correct thing. You are just so supremely intelligent and easy to talk to. Loved all our conversations. All the best for life",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a741ca819323d199d491ef,Devansh  Shringi
11,"First memory of you I remember is you asking to  Rajat sir, ""Why is this thing (an equation on board) non trivial"". From then having you as a friend, working with you on all the projects (damn david didn't send us the money :( ), and getting to know you have all been a pleasure. You inspire me to try new things in life, and not procastinating. Your passion and ambition about things is unparalleled and I wish I could have some amount that. 

Also all the best for the novel. I cant wait to have that on my shelf.  Keep working your ass off to write more amazing stuff ",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a6113f819323d199d489e8,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
12,"I dont think we would have ever met if not for snehal. From sucking in ICPC 2 times in a row, not getting money for the nutanix hackathon, to almost all assignments and projects together. I don't think I will feel more lucky than this to have met someone. If not for you, I am pretty sure I could have completed any project. And Best is your ability to threaten people to work.. and those gpu grabbing skills 

I would always want you in my team if I am working on a project.. and more so like one oof my bestestt friends.. Though our friendship depends on how much I like the drama suggestion you gave..

Earn load of money in korea.. send me samung watches, kindles, airpods

From winning the nutanix hackathon to our first paper and literally having the same resume.. its been an awesome experience. All the best

13,Kya se kya ho gye dekhte dekhte. Itna evolution toh kisi ka nhi dekha. First year me toh baat nhi hui kyoki tum chemistry ke the :D. Tera passion dekhke bahot accha lagta. Awesome personality. Tu na hota to placement na lagta mera.. bahot help kari hai tune. Cannot ever forget that. First memory of you is you getting aghast by what I and suprateek were talking about it.

14,"Most fun to talk to the person to hang out with. Jab Bhi aata that there room me ghus jaata  that. Shubham aur tharwani ki bitching karne me kya maza aata tha. If I remember correctly, talked to you for the first time during PE, Jahan terko har din wo instructor awkward karta tha. Cant describe you possibly selfless you are.  I am just glad your roll number comes close to me and I could interact with you so much. Btw miss Ludos in mini militia. ",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a5934f819323d199d48720,Kratik  Jain
15,"Nothing but huge respect your bro. I don't know how you are good at everything you do. Even though we  havent talked much, I know you are a great person and a great friend to have.

16,Always will be uncle for me.. cant even think of calling you anything else. Mess table conversations were always so fun with you. Your extremely misogynistic views about everything were fun to hear.  Your ability to pull out last year's question papers is second to None. Love your passion for books and seeing you read tons of history books has also got me interested in it.. I am pretty sure you will be writing a book in a short time which might get you a man booker or get you jailed. Waiting for that.. cant even write all the hilarious conversations we had... just too many. Stay like this and keep loving Manendra Agarwal. We all know your love for him.. or her,Keshav  Bansal,False,60a59d7b819323d199d4873b,Md Saquib Hussain

18,Will always remember how we struggled with vim in our second year. And basically everything with that godamn gpu server. Thanks to you and snehal for tagging me to that project. It has always been fun to work with you. You are an insanely nice person to talk to 🤗. Btw that hack to reduce the authors' name in references just blew my mind. All the best for your life ahead ☺️,Keshav  Bansal,False,60a743f8819323d199d491f2,Prateek  Varshney

You deserve it ",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a69260819323d199d490ed,Rishabh  Batra

Bangalore me pata chala ki tu kitna badha cricket fan bhi hai. Watching the  world cup with you and snehal on your phone in that shitty restaurant was one of the highlights there.

Fir wo khana khana khakar orange lays kharidna and blue lays ko diss karna XD. It goes without saying how hardworking and intelligent and passionate you are. I have always loved talking to you and that will remain constant throughout 🤗

22,"Hey!
It was great fun talking to you during those chemistry lab sessions. I remember how we used to feel joyous when we actually got good results in it and not had to make up random observations. And ESO208, I still feel the horrors of that course. It been awesome knowing you :)",Keshav  Bansal,True,60a5a631819323d199d48757,Ritika  Ajmera

One thing I am sure of in my life is that I can trust you for the best piece of advice about anything.
