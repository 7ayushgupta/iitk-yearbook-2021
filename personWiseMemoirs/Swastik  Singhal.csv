0,"Hey Ananya,
You've been a great friend to me and you were one of those people who were with me when I needed them. You helped me i studies and always motivated me to do well in life.
We have countless memories like talking in front of TB, random jokes in classes, especially the double meaning ones, naming you p**ty 😛, visiting your home in Gurgaon, all the chai dates, and many more.
And yes you were my best friend and I regret being drifted apart after first sem. I guess I missed out on a lot of fun with you.
Logo ko lagne laga tha ki hum date kar rahe hain :-P:-P
I hope we meet regularly in future and hang out more... Probably plan a trip also..",Swastik  Singhal,True,60cf7c1c659165b3aa646753,Ananya  Goswami
1,"Yo Avisha
You are the most chilled out girl I've ever met. I loved hanging out with you and bitch about others 😛
Remember the time we made a bet on who'll make the most double meaning jokes 😂😂 and obviously you lost.. 😂
That shopping experience with you was such fun.. Maybe we should do that again sometime 
Also please share those photos with me if you still have them.😂
I hope we meet again soon..",Swastik  Singhal,True,60cf7d89659165b3aa646766,Avisha
2,"Hey Dishaa,
Its been a while since we hung out. I still remember how you, Ananya and Avisha helped me during the worst time of my life. We became best friends instantly in the first semester and now when I look back I feel so lucky to have you as a friend. Fests were so amazing with you guys and I hope you still remember my signature step :P
Its sad that we drifted apart after the first sem but I had some reasons. But looking back now, none of those reasons were good enough to lose an amazing friend like you. I hope we catch up again in future and hang out whenever we have a chance.",Swastik  Singhal,True,60bd1ddf659165b3aa645038,Dishaa  Rajora
3,Maine kuch nahi kiya tha.. Tu khud hi itni baatein karti rehti thi ki deregister toh hona hi tha.. :P,Swastik  Singhal,False,60bd1ad9659165b3aa645037,Jaya  Maheswari

5,"Khichar sir chaapu wale sir.. Apni wing ka superstar hai tu bhai.
Bhai tere saath canteen jaane ke alag hi maze the.. saala kaam karte se utha kar le jata tha. Tere se zyada chill aur mast banda nahi mila.. Pure sem nahi padhte the but fir bhi exam mein chaap dete the.. Agar campus mein kisi ko pubg khelne ka award milna chaiye toh woh tu aur tera judwa bhai hain :P Kya hi alag level ke pro players ho bhai (Emulator par :P).
Tere ko zabardasti MT le jaane mein jo maza tha woh MT jaane mein nahi tha.. Gudgudi karte hue le jao :P
Aur bhai yeh last sem ki bakchodi toh alag level thi.. Tere room ki toh gaand hi maar li thi.. sab wahi baithe milte the. Tagda mahaul banta tha.. 
Tu life mein aage kaafi machaega aur agar possible hua toh pakka saath mein startup zarur kholenge.. ",Swastik  Singhal,True,60bd1a5f659165b3aa645036,Rahul Kumar Khichar
6,"Ram bhai..
Apan first year mein toh kaafi ghume the saath mein.. Kaafi maza aata tha tere saath.. Ab bangalore mein ghumenge mast aur har Saturday night partyyyyy",Swastik  Singhal,True,60cf7f2b659165b3aa64677a,Ram  Goyal
7,"Bro kaha se shuru karu samajh nahi aata. 4 saal ki dosti ek memoir mein toh nahi likhi ja sakti but i'll try.
We met in the library and I thought you were some random Y17 guy with a common friend but kisne socha tha ki apan best friends ban jaenge.. Tu un logo mein se hai jinse mai kuch bhi share kar sakta hu and tu judge bhi nahi karta.
Tere saath chai dates and trips to banarsi tea stall are so memorable to me. Hall 4 mein raat ko sirf chai ke liye milte the and dil ki saari baatien khol dete the. Those were the best of times.
Apni mussorie trip toh bhai bakchod thi and tu mujhe agli trip se pehle swimming sikha diyo please!! :PP
You are one of the best persons I met on campus. You were a true friend to me and always tried to correct me when I was wrong. You stood with me always when i was low and always celebrated with me in my highs. Tu hamesha mujhe encourage karta hai aage bhadne ke liye and that is a very rare thing on campus tbh. I really miss you man.
I will always be there for you whenever you need me.
Call me when you want, call me when you need, call me in the morning and I'll DEFINITELY be on my way.
Tu mera dost nahi, bhai hai bhai. Love you brother. ",Swastik  Singhal,True,60bd1757659165b3aa645035,Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai
8,"Ab kya hi share karu tere baare mein.. Itni bakchodi toh kisi ke saath nahi jitni tere saath hui hai.. Kya faltu ke jokes pe paagalo ki tarah haste the aur shekhar ki maarte rehte the..
Apan Bakchod roommates the..
Bas milte rehna bhul mat jaiyo bada aadmi bankar 😂",Swastik  Singhal,False,60cf7e99659165b3aa646770,Yaghyesh  Chouhan
9,"Yo baheti bro!
Teri vibe kaafi tagdi hai and Tu banda bhi kaafi acha hai.
Tere se kaafi inspire hota hu mai jab bhi milta hu..
I'm glad to have met you at IITK",Swastik  Singhal,True,60cf8082659165b3aa646791,Yash  Baheti
