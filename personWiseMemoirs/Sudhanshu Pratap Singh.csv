Bhai 4 saal mujhe tolerate karne ke liye thankyou :P
And as hota rightfully said teri taang khichai and chidhana was just an expression of our friendship, still agar kabhi kuch zyada ho gaya ho to uske liye sorry. 
Also bhai thankyou for all those assignments and doubt clearing sessions before the exams, bc that really helped me passing some crucial courses, Dill se dhanyawaad.
Baaki hardworking toh tum ho hi but I we suggest you to not get easily depressed and be confident.

I wish that the future brings yo a lot of joy, happiness and success.

Aur haan you are a true gamer, so be proud :) ",Sudhanshu Pratap Singh,True,60a64d39819323d199d48dd7,Piyush  Singh
