This is definitely the toughest memoir that I am going to write.
Wing, Humanoid, Takneek, Roboclub, H205 - in sab ke saath kitni achchi memories judi hai apni. 
Orientation ke time tu wing ka sabse energetic aur enthu wala banda laga tha mujhe. Aur ye reputation tune jald hi waapas gain kar liya tha.
Humanoid team ke liye tera dedication alag level tha bhai. From my point of view, ek time aisa tha jab Humanoid team was mainly Abhay Varshney. Is point se waapas team build karne mein tera hi sabse bada contribution tha. Team ko South Korea leke jaane mein bhi tera hi sabse bada (technical aur non-technical dono) contribution tha hi. Sabhi ne give up kar diya tha, tab bhi tu data raha, aur end mein funds collect ar hi liye! Itna persistence kisi mein nahi hota bhai. Iske liye massive respect hai tere liye.
2nd year Takneek ke time teri Hall feel bohot paas se dekhi maine. HEC ki post chod ke Hall Captain banne ki soch raha tha tu, itna man tha tera Takneek jeetane ka. Raat raat bhar jagke bachcho ke saath baith ke bots banwaaye the tune. Yahi sab dekh ke to Y18 ke laundo mein hall feel aayi hogi!
Roboclub mein bhi you ‘led by example’. Mainly teri wajah se hi maine renom mein apply kiya tha (you may not agree here XD) Summers mein 3-legged jumping robot ke bachcho ko ek point pe pyaar ho gaya tha tujhse <3 Tech Meet ke bot pe bhi tune god-level kaam kiya, aur karwaya. Dedication aur persistence - you personify these qualities. You completely deserve the SnT Excellence Award!
I know I wasn’t the best of all room-mates, par haan, maine bhi kaafi grow kiya hai personally H205 mein. It got over extremely abruptly though.
Maze bhi bohot kiye hai apan ne, aur tere bohot maze bhi liye hai. Tere Dilbar dance ki video banaane ko tu dhoka maanta hai, par mai usko farz maanta hu. Ye maine tujhe bohot baar bola hai- “Agar tu sirf dost hota to mai video nahi banaata, par tu bohot achcha dost hai isliye maine video banayi”
Tu Bangalore, mai Mumbai aur Jay Gurgaon - could things get any worse? 
Par milte hai bhai jald hi. All the Best!
Love you bro <3",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60c20145659165b3aa645783,Abhay  Varshney
1,"Lord Bhatia!
It has been great to know you man.
Tu, mai aur Jay ek baar Chickblast gaye the, aur phir tere room pe jaake bohot der tak baatein ki thi. Us din I realized tu kitna caring, old-school aur simple banda hai. 
Well, before that, I thought of you as a fun-loving, spoilt rich (us time 5 tv ka bhi nahi pata tha XD) brat jiska dimaag bohot tez chalta hai par jisko faltu ka rona bohot pasand hai. 
2nd year mein we somewhat went through an existential crisis together, jiske baad tu IC ban gaya. Intern season tak tu sabse famous IC ban gaya tha imo XD 
Tu Pune aaya tha tab mai bohot excited tha bhai <3 aur maine excitement mein naively tera instagram account public karwa diya XD sorry for that. Agar mujhe us summer mein campus na jaana padta, to mai Pune ke baare mein tera opinion better karwa deta.
Thanks a lot for all the support and guidance during placements bhai <3. Bohot important decisions teri wajah se sahi hue, aur confidence bhi bohot boost kiya tha tune.
Apne Hona Chahiye group mein exactly wahi diverse but similar log hai jinse maine IITK mein sabse zyada seekha hai <3. I really hope hum log achche dost bane rahenge, aur minimum at least mahine mein ek baar poker+bulla sessions karte rahenge. 
Love you bro <3 Bas touch mein rehna!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60cd8191659165b3aa6463e5,Abhishek  Bhatia
2,"Bhai Marathi mein memoir likh ke dil khush kar diya tune <3
Humne kitni saari football matches ek saath “dekhi” hai, kaafi interesting football discussions kiye hai. 
Bhai tu bhi United fan ban gaya to mujhe bohot khushi hogi. Maine is saal football achche se follow kiya hai (believe it or not, bohot saari matches poori dekhi hai). It's a good time to be a United fan right now.
Apart from football bhi bohot achchi memories hai tumhare saath <3
Jald hi milte hai bhai. All the best!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60c1a4d2659165b3aa64548f,Aditya  Raghuwanshi

It’s been great to know you man! From being a huge fan of your wing art to supporting Verstappen together, all our interactions were so damn fun. I remember a lot of interesting conversations we had in your wing and around the hall. 
Also, great work with SAE man! It is because of people like you that the SnT culture is flourishing in IITK.
Let's meet sometime soon man. All the Best for everything ahead!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60cf61f2659165b3aa64664f,Akshay
4,"Yo Bahubali!
1st year se hi bohot mast aadmi lagta tha tu. 1st year summers mein apan room-mates the thode time ke liye, tab bohot maza aaya tha. Tere saath ki kuch bohot mast badminton matches yaad hai mujhe. Aero club ka tera dedication dekh ke bohot sahi lagta tha, aur thoda inferiority complex bhi aata tha. Corona ke chakkar mein mil nahi paaye hum college mein, par teri job location Mumbai aa gayi to mai bohot khush hunga!

6,"Heyyoo Anshika,
It has been great to know you! I know I wasn’t the easiest person to work with, but working with you has been a delight. Outreach Cell wouldn’t have been fun if it weren’t for you. Campus mein hote to aur maza aata imo. 
Bohot kuch sikhne ko bhi mila tumse <3 Kaam karte time you were always polite and projected calmness- something I tried to learn. Mock-en-joy aur ABP jaise involved initiatives manage karna was a big feat. You have my respect for pulling it off <3
Tujhe ye yaad nahi hoga maybe- Jab maine 2nd year mein Vox join kiya tha, tab first day there was this introduction game. Chits thi, and I got the chit with your name. From that introduction, the only thing I remember now is that you are nocturnal XD but this was a nice coincidence in hindsight.
Also, thank you for listening to all my ENG rants <3 You praising my rants was the only good thing that came out of that course for me XD
Let’s meet up soon. Tumhare saath cocktails peeni hai <3 All the Best for everything ahead!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60cde338659165b3aa646416,Anshika  Verma
7,"“Dost wali feeling kam, bhai wali jyada aati hai” ye ekdum hi sach kaha yaar tune. 

Bhai teri Sainik School ki stories to mast lagti thi mujhe- kaise tu seniors ka maar khaata tha and all XD ek mobile charger ki story achche se yaad hai mujhe. Train wali, aur Sports meets wali stories bhi yaad hai. Teri ye light-hearted stories detailed descriptions ke saath sunna patience ka kaam to hota tha, par mazaa bhi bohot aata tha. 

Tune ek baar bataya tha ki subah bhaagne jaana ho to brush waapas aake karna XD subah ki exercise ke liye ye mai aaj bhi follow karta hu bhai. Mai first year mein to randomly pride ke saath tere baare mein brag karta tha- “mera roommate 800 logo ki marathon mein just thodese margin se 2nd aaya”. 

Bohot interesting roommate tha yaar tu- first year meis tu jis passion se apna hockey pursue karta tha wo mujhe bohot motivate karta tha. Hockey, Clash of Clans, professional singing, MSO201 jaisa mushkil course- tu jaha bhi apna 100% deta hai, waha chaap hi deta hai. Bohot achchi memories attached hai meri in sab se <3

Glad to have you as an integral part of my IITK journey bhai. Milte hai jald hi!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60b9075b659165b3aa644f79,Anshuman  Pal
8,"Yoo Saini bro!! 

Remember how lockdown happened just before Techkriti in our 3rd year. Bohot achchi planning ke saath prep chal rahi thi. Apne time apan chart-paper pe tape lagaake kar rahe the practice, is baar 3 hafte pehle hi practice arena print hoke aa gaya tha! Jitni mehnat humne last ke 2-3 dino mein ki thi, utni mehnat 1-2 hafte ke liye bachcho se karaata. Phir to jeet hi jaate Techkriti, right? <3

Of course, bolna aasan hota hai, but maine IARC mein apna 100% deke agle 10 saal ke liye small robotics ka ek strong base banaane ka plan banaya tha- a “goal” that was inspired by your hardwork, dedication and attitude from a year ago! 

Apni Techkriti ke time bhi tera dedication dekh ke kaam karne aata tha mai. I had never seen anyone work day and night on something before. (tu at least 2 raat soya hi nahi tha) Ye mai pehle bhi bol chuka hu tumhe- Honestly, maine tere saath kaam nahi kiya hota to mai shayad hi apply karta coordinator ke liye. Thanks a tonne for all the motivation bro! Also thanks a lot for being a constant well-wisher of Robotics Club and being an integral part of the roboclub family in our 3rd year as well!

Tumhare wing mein jab tune dog hut banaane ke initiative liya tha tab tere liye respect aur badh gayi thi. Aise achche kaam karte rehna bhai <3
Bohot energetic aur “feel wala” aadmi hai tu, matlab har cheez 100 percent feel ke saath karta hai.Alumni Reunion wale sessions aur SCGP mein certificates wala initiative chapwa diya tune bro! Aise hi bakchodi karte rehna bhai.

It was great to know you! Kaafi interesting personality ho tum XD
Firstly, meri handwriting ki taareef karne ke liye thanks :)
Jab lab partners the tab maine ek cheez observe ki thi- iItni frustrating lab mein bhi tum ekdum hi shaant aur thande dimaag se sochti thi, aur maine tumhe kabhi bhi gussa hote hue nahi dekha tha. Ye bohot respectable lagta hai mujhe.  
Udghosh ka failed plan yaad hai? Wo kaafi unlucky tha :P

Watching Infinity War, watching GOT with the world at 6 am, AND being “The Stalkers” <3 Although we sucked at being stalkers lol.

It has been great to know you Inshu! We first met when apan roboclub tshirt design karne ki team mein the. Tshirt to nahi bani thi, but those were fun times XD Of course, tumhare saath Ralph Breaks the Internet dekhna yaad hai mujhe. Movie to bohot achchi thi hi <3 (One of my all-time favourites), but uske baad campus mein tumhare saath ghumne mein bhi bohot mazaa aaya tha. That was the first time mai campus gate se hostels tak chalke aaya, only because of the amazing company I had <3

21,"(Firstly, pehle wala memoir trial tha. You can delete that at will.)

The first memory that I recollect of us is waiting outside the bathroom at 8 am together for our turn (Campus tour bus wala bhi yaad aa raha hai, but I think Bathroom line wala pehle hua) First year mein hum kaafi ajeeb the I guess XD

Achche dost banne se pehle hi tere creative side ke liye respect aa gaya tha- Art105 ka “Endsem hila denge” song, teri maa wali poem, tera synthesizer bajaane ka passion (ye maybe choti cheez ho, but I have not seen anyone else play a song on a synthesizer without having learnt that song before). In sab cheezo ko aage bhi time dete rehna bro. 

One of the first most memorable nights on campus for me was the time tu, mai, Nikunj OAT ki chat pe gaye the. Is night ko 4 saal bhi nahi hue, par phir bhi bohot puraani baat lag rahi hai mujhe. 

My life at IITK would have been incomplete without you man. Blue World ke Columbus ki ride se Placements ki ride tak sab saath mein hi kiya hai apan ne. I agree that among all our friends, we spent the most time together, did so many things together. Aawaz karne wale tere yellow sandals, Udghosh PR, Tech Meet prep aur Mumbai saath mein jaana (btw this was the only time jab hum dono room-mates the- for 2 days I guess), Agra ki trip, courses saath mein padhna and projects saath mein karna, Takneek, summers mein Acting Gensec ka kaam, Robo vs Batti ki rivalry, aur mere room pe kiye hue random discussions- in sab se bohot achchi memories attached hai meri <3

Koi bhi semester ho ya Tech Meet ka sabse challenging Problem Statement- “is baar to sahi mein doob gaya” kehke alag level randi rona karne ke baad bhi har baar chaap hi deta hai tu. 

Of course, regrets bhi kaafi hai. 3rd sem ke tere dasse ki khushi nahi dekh paaya tha yaar mai, although tu dassa aate hi mere room pe aaya tha bataana :/ Campus na aane ka regret to pata hi hai tujhe. Aur tere saath bhand hona (abhi ke liye) reh gaya yaar bas. Wo bhi Inter IIT jeetaane ke celebration mein! Ye moment miss karna bohot hi zyada regret karunga mai. 

Par chill hai, apan mil hi lenge jald hi. Mere ancestors bhi Chittor se hi hai, isliye tu mujhe Chittod ki ek trip karaane wala hi hai for sure :)",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60b8a7ff659165b3aa644f74,Jay  Mundra

Great work with PClub man! It is because of technically sound, philanthropic people like you that the SnT culture is flourishing in IITK.

Technically sound as well as amazing at managing as well as calm under pressure - campus mein ye complete package maine sirf tujh mein dekha hai. 
Roboclub coordi ke liye apply karne ka mera main reason tha ki tere aur Abhay ke saath achche se kaam karne ko milega. And that turned out to be one of my best decisions. Bohot kuch seekhne ko mila tujhse bro <3
Tu GenSec ban jaata to aur maza aata bhai.
Apne Hona Chahiye group mein exactly wahi diverse but similar log hai jinse maine IITK mein sabse zyada seekha hai <3. I really hope hum log achche dost bane rahenge, aur minimum at least mahine mein ek baar poker+bulla sessions karte rahenge.

As you said, we met pretty late. But I had known you right from 1st year, because of this amazing team that you led. If you remember, I said this in a Council meeting too- Team Aerial Robotics has an ideal structure and all teams should follow it, since all students coming out of Aerial Robotics are technically the most sound. From what I know, you (and maybe a couple of seniors) are the brains behind Aerial Robotics’ foundational success and I have mad respect for you.

It has been great to know you man! You were literally the first friend I made outside my wing during Orientation, when we vibed over Breaking Bad. We have come a long way since then, with our names written with equal weightage on most probably the only research paper I will ever write. Thanks for motivating and guiding me throughout our project. I know I wasn’t the easiest to work with, but it was a delight to work with you! Apart from that, kaafi interesting mess-table aur canteen conversations kiye hai apan ne. It was always fun to hangout with you. EE381 ki lab Saksham pe innuendos banaake nikaalte the hum XD  
Also, great work with CS man! Aise hi achche kaam karte rehna. 
PS: Prof banne pe achchi grading karna <3
Let's meet sometime soon man. All the Best for everything ahead!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60cf5edc659165b3aa646640,Sagnik  Mukherjee
36,"Yo Saksham!
Bohot hardworking, reliable aur achcha insaan hai tu <3 Tere saath baat karne mein humesha maza aata tha. Batti lab mein bhi innuendos maarte maarte kaafi achcha time nikal jaata tha XD Yess, teri Urban Crave ki treat mein mazaa aaya tha.
Outreach Cell ki ppt mein tune mera naam likha tha aur maine tera <3 It would have been interesting to work with you here. Placements ke time bohot discuss karte the apan. PPO lene ke baad bhi meri bohot madat ki tune, thank you so much for that.
Let’s meet soon man. All the Best for your life ahead!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60c1a059659165b3aa645487,Saksham  Gupta
37,"Mai aaj tak jitne bhi logo se mila hu, tere jitne tez aur shaant dimaag aur kisika nahi dekha bhai. Par first year se last year tak aate aate tera dimaag bohot saari alag directions mein sochne laga hai XD 
Yaad hai mai first year mein humesha tere aur shubham ke room pe brush karne aa jata tha XD tu kabhi gussa nahi hua par. 1st year mein ESC101 mein mera (border pe) A teri wajah se hi laga yaar. Thanks a lot for that
2nd year mein to apan room-mates hi the. I don’t think I was a good room-mate, par tu bohot zyada bakchod room-mate tha. 
Glad to play a small role in your exciting internship day. Aise hi chaapte rehna aur treats dete rehna <3
Wo OAT ki chat pe jaana alag level thrilling tha bhai, aur OAT ki chat se view bhi kya mast tha us din
Most importantly, bada aadmi banne pe bhul mat jaana mujhe bro <3 ",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60bc9b34659165b3aa644fff,Sarthak  Singhal
38,"Hey Shreyash!
It was great to know you since first year man. Galaxy ELS practices used to be so much fun! Playing dumb charades while ridiculing a particular HEC member lol - definitely the best stress buster. Crippled or regular DumbC, you were the best actor on the Hall 5 team man. Stock the Stock was amazing too. We aren’t the best “Stalkers” out there XD Remember the long CS rant in Hall 5 canteen in our 4th sem? Tu, mai aur Bhatia the. 
Anyways, All the Best man! Let’s keep in touch.",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60cdd8cf659165b3aa646412,Shreyash  Ravi

42,"Yo fellow mean girl! Bohot zyada maza aaya tha Galaxy ELS mein yaar. Apni 2nd year Dumb Charades team turned out to be strong man XD even with a random Y18. Middle East -> Football -> Jordan -> Petra of Jordan was some next-level stuff.  4th year mein it would have been even more fun.

Also, Outreach Cell mein apply kiya tha tab your motivation helped me a lot <3 Thank you so much for that. Also, insane respect for your creativity man. Time-travel wali short film was mind=blown.

Really glad to know you. Hoping we meet again sometime soon!",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60bc90c6659165b3aa644ffe,Yash  Kuwade
43,"Yo Chair Sir!
The first time we met was in your wing during your 1st year senator elections. Mai Nikunj ka campaigner ya kuch tha lol. It has been great to know you since then. 
Bohot meticulous aur hardworking insaan hai tu, but you somehow make everything look very easy for you. In my opinion, “Things are under control” ye reassuring image personify karta hai tu. EE DUGC, TA202 project, so many batti courses and assignments, consulting prep, random doubts, time pass - in sab ke liye you were just a text message away. (Typically replied within 30 seconds <3). Bohot trustworthy aur mast insaan hai tu. This thing, which I wrote a few months should go here imo-
Movie character Yash relates to: Andy Dufresne from Shawshank Redemption
Key strengths (3-4) they find in the candidate:
-Yash is extremely persistent and dedicated in all his efforts. 
-Along with being a good ideator, he has the execution skills necessary to take any such initiative to completion. 
-Yash is a delightful person to work with and never hesitates from going out of his way to support others. 

Tu Mumbai aa jaaye to aur zyada mazaa aayega! In either case, milte hai jald hi. All the Best bhai!

Achche dost banne se pehle bhi 1st year se hi tere dedication aur thinking ko bohot admire kiya hai maine. You wouldn’t remember this, but ek baar tune apne GSOC prep ke sacrifices ke baare mein tha. Alag level motivating mess table conversation tha bhai wo. Also, 1st year se hi course planning karne ka tera example mai humesha deta hu juniors ko.Throughout college life, tere saath ke conversations bohot intellectual aur insightful hote the. Including all our poker table discussions <3 
Bhai MS mein mera London desk aa gaya to maza aa jaayega!
Apne Hona Chahiye group mein exactly wahi similar but diverse log hai jinse maine IITK mein sabse zyada seekha hai <3. I really hope hum log achche dost bane rahenge, aur minimum at least mahine mein ek baar poker+bulla sessions karte rahenge. Bhai Hona Chahiye is the best startup founding team - dreamers-realists, techies-managers, optimists-pessimists sab hai apne paas <3 Agle 7-8 saal mein apne group ko plan karke sahi mein startup karna chahiye. Apan dono initiative lenge please. Kyuki as you say, having starting of your own is the only way to be filthy rich at the age of 50 <3 
All the Best for everything ahead! Milte hai bhai jald hi.",Neil Rajiv Shirude,True,60cf1bb9659165b3aa64656a,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
