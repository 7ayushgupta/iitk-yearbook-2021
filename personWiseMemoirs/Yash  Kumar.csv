0,"It has been great knowing you bhai! Thank you for being part of CS300 group otherwise I would have managed to get an X grade! From the short time we knew each other, I can say you'll do amazing at whatever you do! Wishing you all the very best for your future!",Yash  Kumar,True,60cf7bb6659165b3aa64674d,Ayush Hitesh Soneria
1,"Ah, my intellectual and physical companion! We have done everything what we could do together from debates, wrestling, quizzing, binge watching to simply not talking with each other. When my mom saw that pic of both of us looking at each other in the bed in the first year on fb, she asked me what the hell is this XD But I can't explain our bond in some stupid memoir although I will try! If you weren't there, I would have been such a boring person. You are the spiciness in my biryani! 
I used to be literally dragged out of my room just for a game of MM or PUBG or be forced to part with half of my maggi for you in the canteen. On the outside I might have appeared agitated or angry, but inside i didn't mind it even one bit and probably you know that too. Thankfully I could write about quizzing in my resume because you used to take me to them and i am pretty sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it that much if it was with someone else. Won't forget the tv series we spent watching on your laptop on your bed although you would watch them without waiting for me :P Thank you for introducing me to the only song I've liked, heaven. I can go on and on but there are too many memories to write all of them down (Maybe I should consider making a separate diary listing all those memories?)

Obviously this won't be complete without congratulating you for the placements and IIM A selection. Bigger challenges lay ahead, so here's wishing you all the very best for your upcoming endeavors and I know your best shot will be enough!

I hope we meet again!

2,"The Gentleman of IITK! 
There isn't a more polite, humble guy like you. Literally everyone in the campus knows you. I am so lucky to count you among my bhais! I have enjoyed all the bakchodi you've done upon me and you are one of the most convincing liars I have met. Your gunshot story will remain immortalized in my mind XD!  You were my go-to FIFA buddy, and would always be around to cheer me up. You were the party organizer among our bhaiyon! Looking back now, I can't thank you enough for forcing me to go on your wonderfully organized trip! I know I couldn't complete the trek, but next time I won't fail you. I only hope that I am able to imbibe some of your qualities. Just don't forget me and I wish in the future our paths cross again. Ab bas ek baar Dilli aao, milte hai. Aur kitni baar bolu?

3,"While we were changing rooms at the beginning of our 2nd year, I for a moment thought ki kuch gadbad toh nahi hoga agar Naman mera roomie ho jaye. But Bhai now I can say I was the most lucky guy to have you as a roomie. Tere bina I wouldn't have known anything about clg or hostel aur ekdum simple ladka ho jaata. 
I was always in awe of your daredevilry, like when you proposed a girl during Antaragni or got a sofa in our room or the way you conducted the Hall Day! You lived on your own terms and feared no one. 
I won't forget when you took me to the clinic during internships after my machine stopped working. 
As a roomie you have seen all my sides whether I was angry, grumpy or just dancing but I never felt ashamed. I knew you would keep my secrets safe :P 
Ab bas placements phod dena! And before you graduate we need to meet once more, preferably on a trip!",Yash  Kumar,True,60c2338c659165b3aa645b1d,Naman  Jain
4,"Sir, you are truly one of a kind. Won't forget the first time we met, when we roaming in the hall trying to find a water cooler in our orientation days. Never knew it was just the beginning of a wonderful friendship. You've always enjoyed and excelled at everything that was thrown your way, be it water polo, studies, football, dance, etc etc and have always inspired the people around you. Aur group ke baat, it was intentional. Always wanted to be in your group because that was the only way I could pass. Thank you for explaining me everything the night before the exams _/\_. Won't forget all the fun we had together from fifa nights to having cycling races from classes to hostel! Also, sorry for scaring you that you had to jump from the cycle :P. Just waiting to meet you once my lockdown gets over and pls don't forget me! ",Yash  Kumar,False,60cf7a70659165b3aa64673e,Satyam  Ralhan
5,"Life in college would be incomplete without you. I have been subject to a lot of pranks in my four years and am pretty sure you were the mastermind in most of them. Will never forget your heartbreak with Nishita XD. Also, thank you for waking me up in the morning without asking you to do so ( Never mind the fact I still did not get up :P )

Despite all the fun, you were always focused on your studies and that would motivate me as well. I wish you all the successes in life. Stay the same and do keep in touch.
