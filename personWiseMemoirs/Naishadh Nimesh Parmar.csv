2,"Hey man! We haven't talked a lot, but whenever we did I always felt like an immediate connection. Some topics that I have rarely found anyone to relate with, I could relate with you and one of them was New York City of course! Apni ek US road trip pending rahi boss! That Bryan Adams concert I'll remember for a long time to come, it was so much fun vibing to all those songs. Hope we meet soon and all the best! And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes I'll see you on the dark side of the moon :D",Naishadh Nimesh Parmar,True,60cf7685659165b3aa646702,Ayush  Agarwal

14,"Kabhi saath me campus wapas aana hua toh sabse pehle DoAA canteen chalenge. Maggi, chai and then tabki life ka critical analysis, uske baad Hall 12 canteen me bahar coffee pe current events ka discussion xD. You barging into my room and hugging everyone always filled me with happiness, those hugs are something I'll miss. I love that I have a friend jiske saath deep discussions bhi kar sakte hai aur random gifs bhi bhej sakte. Like I've been saying since first year, thoda zyada decisive bano, baaki toh sab changa si.
