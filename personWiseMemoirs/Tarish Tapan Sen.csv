0,"I've been fortunate to have had you as my Bhai. You've been the chillest guy in the wing, and doing that while being an absolute monster in athletics is no mean feat. From wolfing down starters but turning a blind eye to the main course at our favourite (and only) buffet joint, to the trek that tested my limits as a human being while you and Bhola literally sprinted over as if it were stairs in a building, and the Zomato orders in between that were way more than what the two of us could handle - thank you for being such a bro. I wish you all the best in life.
P.S.: I am still wearing your recommended slippers! :)",Tarish Tapan Sen,False,60cf6a0f659165b3aa646690,Abhijeet
1,"I'm as surprised as you are with the fact that I actually checked the Yearbook. The enjoyable memories we shared as wingmates will stay with me and all of us, forever. The fact that an overwhelming majority of them have been treats and food-related is way better than anything else I could've hoped for. The Veg vs. Non-Veg dispute goes down in history as one of those crazy, passionate moments that, while at the time was heated, is now a rather hilarious, and by extension an unforgettable experience.
Here's to hoping that ""trip"" you were so excited about comes to fruition in the near future. In the meantime, I'll settle for another BBQN treat :)
So long.",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf69e0659165b3aa64668a,Abhinav  Ankit
2,"Let's just assume I was never ""gone"" :)
I don't think I would have had as many hilarious, fun, and enjoyable experiences at college had I not been fortunate enough to share a wing with you. From the ever-present logic that turns the world topsy-turvy to a trip to be remembered for a lifetime, thank you for being my friend, gifting such vivid memories. I suspect retrospectively I might cringe at this juncture of life, but for the meantime, I gotta keep this short since I had the audacity to keep this task until deadline, not unlike all of us at college. Aunty sends her regards and thanks as well!
So long, and thanks for all the laughs.

3,"Thanks for providing the amazing opportunity at Farrukhabad. The very fact that you could enjoy the Astronomy Club gives me some semblance of satisfaction. I had real fun with you and Naveen, times spent at the Astro Club. I wish you all the best in your life ahead, and keep up the good work that you're doing!",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6ab5659165b3aa64669c,Ankit Kumar (Akhilesh Kumar)
4,"A5 has been an incredible part of my college life. It might have been unexpected, but definitely was more than welcome. Thank you for the memories man, the bulla sessions in Boi's room were highlights in the midst of a mundane hall life. All the best to you, hoping to meet you next in a canteen with samosa, maggi, and a drink on the side :)
Go Team AUV!",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6a7e659165b3aa646699,Ayush Gupta (S Gupta)
5,"Hey man, it's funny how our best memories as being batchmates at IITK is our time at IITB! Nevertheless, thank you for the fun times. I wish you the best in your life ahead.",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6994659165b3aa646684,Ayush Hitesh Soneria
6,"I have tons to say, but little time. Reading your memoir was a quick but vivid tour into the past four years, with stops at all the best of times. I daresay my eyes were on the brink of welling up. I honestly had forgotten the cause of the very first GPL! I've been rather fortunate to have had a Bhai like you, and indeed a wing like ours. I'm trying my best to resist rambling into a lomba lomba para, but the memories are flooding in, and the dam is at it's limit.
I am sure the amount of success you'll receive in life is enormous, if your budding years at college were any hint to that amazing brain of yours. I shall try my best to live up to your vision. Thank you for hopping aboard on this journey, and falling over once, quite literally :) Aunty sends her regards as well!
Here's to hoping I ain't a bot the next time we meet. So long, Bhola.",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf69b0659165b3aa646687,Bholeshwar  Khurana
7,"This is indeed the place, albeit too late. Thanks for being such a great and supportive friend. I honestly don't recall the exact moment we hit it off, but man am I glad we did. From one coordinator (arguably questionable) to another who literally changed the course of history for his Club, I wish you all the success in life. You deserve every bit of it.",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf69cb659165b3aa646689,Harish  Dechiraju
8,"Of all the memoirs, yours probably hits the home run in terms of important advices. Either way, I'm glad we could be friends, and hope that we don't let the cringelords take over our precious meme ecosystem. To stay true to our dynamic, let me sign off with the correct version of 12250. It's been a blast knowing you.

9,"I honestly have no excuses. This statement might mean nothing to the future Y17 E6 reading this, but not saying it now is a sin.
Thank you for being such an honest, humble and brilliant friend. I could count our experiences together and it'd take hours to even begin. From the Diwali ""levitating human circle"" to the fateful trip, you have been the absolute best. To say I miss the sugar and ketchup in everything is a severe understatement. One of these days we'll definitely catch up, but in the meantime know that I am always rooting you.
Thank you Gujju Bhai for being there through ups and downs. Aunty sends her regards as well!",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6a00659165b3aa64668e,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar
10,"Oh man, I don't even know where to begin. The best summer I've ever had in IITK would've been incomplete had you not stayed by my side. I could ramble on about the events we hosted, from Shobhan Mandir to Farrukhabad; but you have encapsulated the core essence in your own memoir. The infectious passion for astronomy and the never-ending enthusiasm for exploring all possibilities, you've taught me what it means to be a leader. You've guided me whenever I was astray as a Coordinator, and for that you have my deepest gratitude. While I may not have yet incorporated it all, I will strive for it.
Thank you for being my friend, and also the Wednesday French Fries. And yes, I'll answer all means of communication henceforth :)",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6951659165b3aa64667f,Naveen
11,"How could I ever forget our time at coaching! I always knew since way back then that you are destined for success. The amount of determination and passion that you have is astounding, from academics to managing such a huge and active club as the Electronics Club, and I respect you for that. I too wish we could have spent more time together, be it at the Astro Club or anywhere else.
We definitely need a Vidyalankar meet-up, which I am aware is easier said than done. However, there's no harm in hoping for the best. Thank you for being a friend, and I wish you all the success in your ventures.",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf69f2659165b3aa64668b,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
12,"We may not have even been acquaintances as freshers, but man am I glad to have met you. Better late than never, eh? The AniSoc has been an integral part of my identity here at IITK, and you have a huge role in it. Unforgettable memories of toiling over Freshers' Cosplay, the heartwrenching feeling of FOMO after (a word you first introduced me to), the fun we had, and the tons of food we gobbled. Thank you for puting up with me and my ""escapist antics"" (ahem). I wish you all the best, and hopefully will finally succumb to watching DMC.

13,"Yo my man! Never thought a wing other than my parent could be so influential in my life at Hall 12, but then came A5 sweeping me off my feet. Thank you for making all those weird antics so memorable. Techkriti would have been drab without y'all hopping in on the fun. Canteen nights with roasted chicken galore is how I imagine our ideal meet-up to be! I shouid also take this opportunity to thank you for legitimately making me aware, woke, and sympathetic with the cause you always stood for. I've hopefully become a better person from it. I wish you all the best in life, a life I'm sure you'll ace with that bright smile unending enthusiasm.",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6a1c659165b3aa646692,Pratham  Shukla
14,"""It's for them jinko yaad nhi karne wale."" Honestly, yaad bhi nahi karne wala, since you shall always stay in my memories. No need to actively remember unforgettable moments; they are 'unforgettable' for a reason. Thank you for being a brilliant friend, memories with you and whole of E6 are too vivid to forget.",Tarish Tapan Sen,False,60cf6a44659165b3aa646696,Ratnangshu  Das
15,"My tryst with the Astronomy Club undoubtedly began with you - Rooftop nights and an absolute blast of a Club trip to remember. It's funny how despite being the most passionate amongst us, you couldn't continue with us. But I respect the choices you made, and respect you more for the same. Takneek shall be ingrained in my heart, with you as my partner-in-crime.
Thanks for sharing the burden as the quintessential Big Guy :)",Tarish Tapan Sen,True,60cf6969659165b3aa646682,Shivansh  Tripathi
16,"Oh man, it's rare to have such an accomplished, insanely intelligent, and downright impeccable guy like as a dear friend. Going down memory lane is a task so ginormous that, as you rightly said, would end in a feels trip so bad this memoir would be left incomplete. The amount of hard work you do, the levels of multi-tasking you can pull off, the awe-inspiring intellect - I wish we could have had common courses if only to see you churning 'em gears in the awesome way you do. The deep dive into meme culture, the Astronomy Club, the over-the-table discussions in the mess (often with way more passion than the topic deserved), the very fact that you became the de facto third roommate... I offer you gratitude for shaping my time at the college the way it turned out. The fact that the pandemic year turned out way better than I had hoped for due to an amazing FLP, which wouldn't have been a fraction of the fun had you not been along with me.
So long, and thanks for all the memories. I'll make sure to stay in touch this time around :)
