Milte to humlog haar hi din the ... itne courses jo saath mai kiyee haii and exams ke baad disscuss krne ke liyee daat bhi itni khaayi haii. It was fun to roam around with you during antargini which turned out to be last antaragini 🥲. I could talk to you about anything freely and I miss those times which ended so abruptly. Slowly and gradually our friendship became stronger ❤️. I always looked for a empty seat near you in class kyuki padha toh jata nhi tha mujhse 😆.You have always been so caring and supportive and sweet and smart lol you are everything that's good 😬. I hate that you didn't came during the last months, there are still many unfinished plans and places to go and hopefully we can do them in the future. Aur kabhi humlog ko bhi apne haath kaa bnna hua tasy khana khilaao itni photos bhej ke jealous krti rheti ho baaaas .... And don't worry agle ek saal taak humlog tumhe feel nhi hone denge ki tum graduate ho chuki hoo 😁",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60c5a4fc659165b3aa6462b1,Abha  Tamrakar

2,"Heyy Apoorvaa ..... we met in drams jab tumm moti thi :),  where we had lot of funs 😆 and I still remember your slaps (._.) and tumhare khule hue baal ❤️.  We were able to spent much time during first year during practices or in CC or NCL . It was such a great time and we became such good friends😍. Lol I am so happy that I found you , I am always able to talk to you anywhere, anytime I see you😬. And yrr first year ke baad toh apnaa koi bhi course kbhi same hi nhi huaa😭 still we were able to remain connected .I hope this college reopens soon so that we can complete our pending plans fastt.

4,"Okay Okay ,,,, Ab mai kyaa hi likhuu tumhare baare mai ................ aisa lgta hai ki bachpan se haar din hi dikhe ho tum school se coaching and phir college mai bhii ........ I remember our first talk in school after mso olympiad which I know you surely don't . Itne shaitaan hua krte the tum school mai ab toh kaafi sudhar gye ho. And the section change in 8th class is the best thing that happened like ever if now I think about it. JIO aane se itne saal phele hi phone pe ghanto laage rhete the hum dono(atleast padhai ko leke hi 🤣). Itni jayda pen fights and gossips. And mere upaar base(NaOH) girane ke liye shukriyaa abhi taak nishaan pdaa hua haii 😑.  I am so sorry for not being sorry that I revealed your secret so early (not able to resist 😶).
Chlo atleast tumhe aakhri aate aate taak iitk mil hi gyaa wrna isse aage kya hi likhta maii. Itni masti , nautanki and irritate mai sayaad hi kisi se huaa hungaa. Itne nighouts, games aur ghoomaa hai humlog nee that you became a important part of my life. Chlo accha hua jabardasti photo keechte rhete the tum ki finally mujhe adadt ho gyii. Itna jaldi mat gussa hua krro be and hopefully humlog kaafi trips mai jaayengee aaage and jitne maaje kiye hai usse jayda hi krrengee and mehnat krte rhena aur aage badte rheenaa 😬😬",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60a539ea819323d199d4841a,Saransh  Nadda
5,"Yo Deekshaa ....
 It always been fun to be with you whether be it in classes or TA lab or roaming around the campus or crying before and after quizzes and exams. 
Don't ever stop supplying the stickers in the group and I will do the same.",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60c5a552659165b3aa6462b3,Deeksha  Yadav
6,"Yuss Deekshaa ........ I already knew about you from Riya but we only first talked at the starting of second year due to TA group ………. uff that confusion between gate and bottle opener and we even messed up the gate opener 😐 and why were we even doing that aesthetics course, the only aesthetic thing was that we were able to talk more and I remember calling you when sir messed up our grades in it☹. We weren’t talking much during that time but it was a start of an amazing and beautiful friendship😍. We never had same lab or group after that because the alphabets separated us >< (why D and P are so far apart 😭).  5th sem classes were so much fun …. aana toh padtaa hi thaa and padha toh jaata nhii thaa so the only other thing we could do was talk. Gradually we started talking things apart from studies and started roaming around and going to canteens and the first time I went to fountain and helicopter building. I still remember your laugh when I told you about my cycle story 😂😂. And you are so honest that you wrote your true details when we all went to VH-extension terrace 😑😑, though it gave us a nice moment to have some fear and excitement at the same time. I just can’t discuss paper after exam with you or it seems like everyone will kill me, so the only thing we do is cry over the paper and professor, and remember when we went to nursery after the exams (last paper kaistha sir kaa) were over, it was so peacefull and everyone sharing their stories😪. I have always admired your direction sense whether be it talking the long or wrong route 😆 and you going to vishal sir office story ><
Fortunately, the lockdown didn’t stop our talks and laugh, since now we have so iterations (from messenger to whatsapp to insta and discord (in progress)) of the same group and I can proudly say that we two are the ones who keep them alive😎. I can’t describe how fun are the stickers fight where we change from violent to lovely ones in the nick of time and we also keep getting new ones (a fair trade i would say😏). 
And you see no matter how much you think you have explored the campus there were always some new places which we were able to find. I was always so happy when we were able to roam around the campus and sad when you didn’t come ☹ still I am grateful that you never got angry at me which I think you should have 😓 . YOUR drawing in Pictionary when we played in teams was at another awesome level , your level of intellect is out of my comprehension 😵. And SIS guards ke saath kitne ajeeb experiences the mtlb kuch bhi ho rhaa thaa uss wakt🤣. Day by Day nothing seems to have changed but now if we look back, we have come a long way ahead.  
I am just glad that I found such a beautiful, caring, hardworking, strong and talented girl as a friend 😍❤️❤️. It seems to me that you have some supernatural powers , you never seem to get tired and go on days without sleep. 
KANPUR mai rheke bhi 20 saal baad mili tumm and milne ke baad bhi itnaa nhi ghumaaa campus ke bhaar humlog nee, I hope we are able to change that after this shitty corona goes away, so much of our plans are pending, so many trips, (..) and trust me I will find a way to complete theem . 
PS: ptaa nhi saalon baad humlog khaa hongee lekin jab bhi tum yearbook dekho toh mera memoir dhundhna nhi padegaa tumhee >_<😉 and you will always get your potraits every year and hopefully on the correct date :)",Prakhar  Srivastava,True,60cf88ef659165b3aa646858,Deeksha  Yadav

8,"Yo jaya remember when we first talked , me neither 😆, 
......nevertheless its nice that we talked , the only thing we talk about are what courses to do, how courses are going and discussing papers after exam, or telling me to mail professors which I only do when you completely supervise me 😂 , we still have some time left in college, lets hope when we meet next time we can talk about other things too and have fun apart from studies 😬, till then take care 😁",Prakhar  Srivastava,False,60ced5ca659165b3aa6464f4,Jaya  Maheswari
9,"As far as I remember , I asked where kuldeep is and you were right behind me, thats the first time we met outside TA class , and after that our friendship has only become stronger 😊, ta lab was fucked up from deciding what to make (door or bottle opener) to finally presenting it, thankfully because of it I got to know you better, i can't remember the time when I didn't laughed while talking with you ...... whether small talks in class or talking after the class was over, it was fun when you came over to my home, you're too good at chess and thankfully you got out alive ❤️❤️, you've a long way to go after all 😁 , I hope we get to meet soon till then keep talking, always be a fun and caring person and take care 😬",Prakhar  Srivastava,False,60cefecc659165b3aa646535,Kuldeep  Singh

14,"Yo Nupur ....... I remember I always wanted to talk to you since the day I saw you but was too shy to do so ☹️☹️.  Fortunately we were both in Udgosh where we first talked in events ground I guess 😬. And more fortunately that you were in chemical where we spent most of the time in labs. In TA we just roam in the lab and talk ,in ESO we just used to sit and talk and in UOP do some work and talk 🤣🤣. Being in the same group and talking with you was always constant and I am so much glad it was you😁. You were always so sweet and fun❤️. I don't know if we learned to drill metals but we definitely learned to drill chalks and pencils.

The little talks before/during/after the classes and 3hr long talks in the labs were always soo much fun . You are a combination of brillance and elegance and I am sooo glad I got to spent so much time with you😍. I was always able to talk to you in any situation and I hope we keep talking.
