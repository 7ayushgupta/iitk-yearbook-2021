What an amazing summer we had. Summer-Camp was fun with you, so was playing volleyball and so was discussing football and life in general.  That Champions league final we went to watch in OAT and you were wearing your Real jersey,  was a very special experience. Unfortunately, things did not pan out as you would have planned and through that difficult phase, its actually commendable how to picked yourself up again. I know I may not have been best of the friends during that time, but I cared and when I look back on it, I think I should have done more and we should have spent some more time together. FIFA match to jarur khelenge ek din. Until then, good luck with everything and take care. You are a very humble person, stay that way and stay in touch.

Kya haal co-actor,
No matter how hard we tried to convey a serious story that video turned out to be funny for the most. You really have a sort of connection with all the dogs cause your taming skills are next level. Thank you for the special memories with BHF. Kaafi dedicated and kaafi sorted ho tum. Good luck with everything and hope to meet sometime  !!",Jatin  Rathaur,True,60cf1d25659165b3aa646574,Swadha  Pandey

Kaafi suna Shitij se Chaggi ye chaggi wo, but jab mile toh dil gad gad ho gya. Quarantine mai parties karwane ko dhanyavad. Baaki, chaapte raho, streak banate raho and milte raho ",Jatin  Rathaur,False,60cf76aa659165b3aa646707,Utkarsh  Sonkar

ART105 was a dream course and we were the lucky bunch that we actually had talented people. Football addiction is real. It was great to hang out with you man. Good luck and let's meet soon.
P.S- Dropping a great quote to bless your memoir by you know who- “If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.”

58,"Kya haal ,
Apni yaari ki shururaat to Econs se ho gyi thi but Manali trip se toh takeoff kar gyi thi. Remember that journey and conversation back from Lucknow sitting on the stairs of UP Roadways. Jaipur mai mast katwaya tha bc tune mera. Playing basketball together was always fun. Last month mai toh adha time tere aur ISHU ke room hi rehta tha mai, sahi time tha wo bhi. 
But seriously man kaafi dedicated tha tu Antaragni ke liye. You were a man on a mission in college, sab kuch calculated tha kya kya and kab kab karna hai. Baaki, milte hai jald hi phir scene banate hai.
Good luck and take care

Bhai, Kaise ho? Is there a better human being than you on earth? No, I don't think so. 
We had sort of a language exchange program, didn't we?  
Sorry for the countless pranks on you, you're Dwight to my Jim but your last prank was really good (trip wala).  Kitna FIFA khela hai bhai sath, those intense FIFA sessions were only time in college when my stress would peak xD. I would have to admit that you have influenced me to be a better person. You re a gem of a guy.

I have seen your transformation in college so closely, your Hindi skills, your eating time. Thanks for the coming on the trip and pushing yourselves. 
Good luck and cheers for our next phase",Jatin  Rathaur,True,60c22cc8659165b3aa645a59,Yash  Kumar
