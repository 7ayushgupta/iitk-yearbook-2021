1,"Hello Abhishek Saini Hall 12,
""Bhai Mathuria teri marne a rha h, chup ja""
Bhai, ya to important gyani baba ho aap meri life me. Pata nahi ye memoir pura justify kar paega, but aap jante ho aise kriyao me ham hagte h 😂

Bhai itni cheeze h likhne ko, but I'll choose 2 most memorable incidents jo ye likhte wakt yaad aye:
1. Ham best bhoot h hall 12 ke 😂
2. Bhai us din me nahi hota to mathuria teri maar leta aur sahi me ek video banake me daal deta us website pe 😂

Anyways dude, started with robowars, things turning a little rusty with all of us in between (my fault), but still going strong. That's us. Teri wing to secondary ghar tha hi mera, ab to same jagah hi aa gaya. Apna to ek aur saal sath h campus me, jaldi aa wing me party karenge. Loads of love ❤️ aur bhai kheyenge tere hi account me 😂. 

PS Aur bc techkriti me tu bas photo khichane gaya tha ye hame pata h 😂",Nitik  Jain,True,60cdeffa659165b3aa646420,Abhishek  Saini

3,"""Excuse me, side hona, photos leni h, tu beech me a rha h"". I still remember those lines, jab pehli baar me aapse mila deviji. 
Sahi me man to kar rha tha wahi bot hi uthake mooh pe maar do :P But anyways, uske baad to me sahi hi kata h shayad sab :P, though mooh todne ki icha to aye din hoti rehti thi apni ek dusre ka XD. Sanda, inchupinchu, kya kya to naam nahi die tujhe XD, but mene fraudi nahi bulaya kabhi, though tu thi XD. Anyways, I've always been hating you, and would continue to XD kiddin :P.Kafi incidents h waise to yaha likhne ke lie, but kya hi likhu, as usual, jaise tune likha, time kam h :P. Shayad tu NFS me beech me ghusi thi, on some pity manner, but i dont  really remember group kaise ban gaya apna XD, and fir to bante hi gaye XD. But all that happens, happens for good. Little did I know itni achi dost milne wali thi, jise ""GIFTS LENA PASAND H XD"" (Casually tagging saini here). I wish I could have written ki kya trip this apni, but pity me I did not ever have a trip with you, so this one is pending :P (Wait, does ganga barrage count in? :P). Btw, Parv is still interested, to boldu ki ""IITK KI SABSE HOT BANDI IS AVAILABLE XD"" (Sarcasm for the general peeps XD)

But ha, thank you for everything, me acha communicator to nahi, but ye perfect place h genuine wala thank you likhne ke lie. Thanks for accepting the wierdness in me, and believe me ki mujhse virutal nahi hota bhai, me nahi badla XD, halat badle h. And pardon me for a bad memoir, but I dont think I can do justice to this writeup in so less time, we have a plethora of incidents to write about, anyways, better that we call often to relive the memoir :P. Aur BC chutia tareeke see texts karna band kar, aur call laga lia kar aisi situation me, L koi texts nahi dekhta XD (ykwim). And also, stop lying and hiding stuff from me, ik mujhse hi cheeze sabse kam share hoti h, aur chupai jati h, but ek baar try to karke dekh XD, nahi to khabrio se sab info nikal jati h XD. And ik I have promised to keep, and things to sort, but wait kare time aur agle episode of life (and if time permits, memoir ) ka XD. 

Yours,

4,"1. Hi Betty,
Let's start with Google :P
Though we were only two seats away, it took us two semesters to finally cross paths (condition, both of us being aware, C-Mid out of reach :P). Oh, I wish now I should have been more courageous, bas 2 kadam hi to chalna tha. Life me probably har cheez end me ki, har kaam me late hua, but oh I swear, agar kismat-e-khuda fir mauke ne dastak di, is baar time pe a jaunga, is baar nahi aalas karunga. 

Kya me ye kehke flirt kar sakta hu, ki ""T.T. to bas ek bahana tha, apse milne ka irada tha :P"", theeke, might not work, but tujhse bura T.T. shayad hi koi khelta tha. But ngl, that summer camp changed my campus life a big swing, not to forget orientation lol, bacho ki ragging nahi leni ati tujhe. 
Post that, mostly hi hello aur apke thermo ke quiz mere dwara likhe jane tak, itna hi interaction ho gaya tha mostly. But, Diwali's have always been eventful for us, haina ;). From that to numerous trip plans, cancellation, boredom, Naman ke maze lena, late-night random texts, time flew. But I am glad we went to Offline on the Roof that day; that broke the ice (both literally and metaphorically), didn't it. 

I still can't believe I ignored you for a complete sem :P, I am still ashamed for that. But, now that I remember, that led us to our first time alone in C.C.D., with me being caught by the very prof I bunked class of X.D. Sorry for the messed up intern call, I wish I could go back, need to make few blocks fall in place. But, post that, the reunion was bound to happen with me in my worst state, at the best possible location, for the worst possible topic (oh, we know what moment are we talking off, I'll save myself the embarrassment of making it public here). They say everything happens for a purpose, I might now have figured it back then (yes, I am slow, especially in your case, remember hall 12 se 6 takes me 30 mins :P), but now that I look back at that moment, I indeed find my best friend bearing me at my worst (again, metaphorically and literally :P).

From that to Hall 4 wala gyan, to ""duniya hi badal do me to pyara sa chamatkar hu"", and then to that unplanned Antaragni night, I think our lives finally started to obey the laws of thermo. What a living manifestation of the butterfly effect that event was. Not every day I miss flights, not every day we bilk 3k worth of drinks :P. So these events officially mark your presence in 2/3 impactful events of my college life. Needless to say, you have always been this special, right :P. Sorry for messing up your birthday really bad. I was never good with birthdays :(. Next time pakka better.
 

Spring brought about spring in our lives too, haina? Chalo firse waise hi rehte h? Probably the best time we had, things sailing like the titanic, but little did we knew that CoVID ka iceberg was closer than it appeared. I am so glad we went to Manali, agar wo kat gaya hota to kise hi pata tha age ka. And I regret missing that opportunity, and then our ""8 Jan"" happened X.D. I still regret not running behind your cab at hotel samrat :(. 

Post that, to numerous cheeze hui. I messed up big (read every) time; kudos to my bad social (read virtually social) skills. But I can't really justify on text how supportive you were. Love you 3000 for that. We saw through every thick and thin, so much so that now we might as well qualify as living proof of the 3rd law of thermodynamics ;). The entropy of our system decreased, and for good :)

Sorry for Goa, but my first visit to Jaipur involved my two best friends couldn't have been better. I wanted to come back sahi me that day, but you knew my halat. Though, 8 Jan will always be special. And then that tiny but beautiful period on the campus. Literally everything falling apart in terms of rules at campus, kuch cheeze reh gai, bahot moments choot gaye, but it was soooooo gooooooood till it lasted. I promise I am the same milestone, just that it needs some polishing. I will be the same :)

Songs have always been special to us. (we didn't choose our yet, the onus on you now) 
But, so quickly life went from ""There for You"" ---> ""Perfect"" ---> ""The Middle"" ---> ""Stay"". Let's take it to ""Love Story"" now? :P 

This marks the end of this long pending memoir, but mark my words if nothing else. We still have lots of time, my list of movies, sorry cards and education to catch up on, hopefully (like really) together <3

P.S. I know I am late again..., nth time after the deadline, but I kept my promise, I managed to get things in place. Hopefully, this is the last time I'll use this superpower :P. Also, that ""1"" has significance X.D.

P.P.S. Here's the answer to some recent question/s posed to me: 
From ""Back to You"" Lyrics: 2nd para first two lines + 3rd para last four lines.

Yaar, ab apna safar itna acha raha h, ki ye bhi yaad nahi dhang se ki chalu kaha hua. Memories badhti hi gai h bhai, but haan mujhe ye yaad h Naman Jain bola karta tha ki tu uska mast dost h aur Ram goyal bhai fod ke aya h JEE XD. Tab se hi talash thi mujhe, but teri height ke chalte bahot baar side se miss ho gaya hoga tu (Kiddin XD). 

Bhai, hyderabad to hamesha yaad rahega, sala ek hi offline intern hui h apni zindagi me, aur khushi h wo tumhare sath hui. Bhai itni masti, Karachi bakery, khandu ke food habits pe debate karna, khandelawal jewellers banwana XD. Bhai itni memories h ki 20000 words exceed ho jae idhar (iykwim)
Islie Hyderabad ko baad me laenge kabhi

Bhai itne secrets h apne ek dusre ke pas, aur mujhe pura bharosa h tu bahot safe rakhega. Goa to kabhi nahi bhool paunga, aur bhai tera wardrobe alag level h. Aur sale itna organized kaise h tu. Goa me alag level to tune hi chaapa tha :P

Bhai tu nahi tha us delhi wali party me, nahi to aag laga dete.  Tera hasi ka bout dekh ke jo maza aya tha XD, bhai sambhal ke rehna, beej khatarnak hote h XD. But ye ek mahina to lifetime yaad rahega, jaldi hi kahi aur F3 banate h. Bhai, tum log hi bhai bane mere iitk ke, aur tu bahot sahi banda h yaar. Jaldi hi ek aur trip chalte h XD kahi nahi to DLF hi chalte h firse. Aur ek din pakka khandu ki jawline ka kissa famour karenge XD

Aur haan bhai, color karde order, bas ab paisa na lena, itna to banta h XD",Nitik  Jain,True,60cf8551659165b3aa6467e8,Ram  Goyal
