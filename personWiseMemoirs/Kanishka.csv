0,"Hi Abha, We haven’t interacted much but if we could I am sure you would have been a great friend to have - someone who is considerate, caring, understanding and funny. I remember coming to your room for notes. Thanks for saving a few of my quizzes and assignments with them. You are a very helpful person with a pleasant personality. Aur tu chaapu toh hai hi. Keep on excelling the way you do. Wish you a great life ahead!

1,"Hi Ashutosh, black belt in taekwondo. Since I was a kid, I have always wanted to learn martial arts but got the opportunity only at IITK which I had to depart from for some reasons. But I remember how impressed I was when I heard you were a black belt and your final fight during the Udghosh competition was awe-inspiring. It was really great and I liked it a lot. The moment you won, we were all relieved. Keep on inspiring people the way you do. Wish you a great life ahead. Until we meet again… Tata :)",Kanishka,True,60cf31a5659165b3aa6465ad,Ashutosh  Kumar
2,"Hi Atishay,
Thanks for lending me the sum that time and also for helping out in 641 assignments. I really needed that amount back then.
All the best for your future :)",Kanishka,True,60a63fc5819323d199d48ccd,Atishay  Shrivastava
3,"Hey Aviral, humne joh kuch kiya voh toh tumne mere memoir mein likh diya. Ab main tumko kya likhun re! Not fair!
In the last four years, starting from Vishal sir’s project to PHY690W ppt, most of the time we talked was about work. I wish we could have spent some time outside of it. Once you told me about your education and squash, in front of the academic area gate, on the way back to our halls. Aur haan, the night we talked under CCD ke saamne waali tree was nice. Tum last month campus bhi nhi aa paaye. But I really think that we still became great friends. We cheated a lot and it was you who helped me with assignments, especially for PHY473A and CS641A. I was a loner, kept a few friends and preferred working alone. But now when I look back, since May 7, 2020, we have been in continuous touch. I never imagined I would take courses with someone and would have such a great time working with him. People’s lives are mostly spent in work and as they say, “Having a friend in the workplace will make your day brighter.”, you did make the last two sems more lively, filled with laughter and fun.
Aur haan, you taught me how to help completely and not partially, giving it your all, without bringing self-interest in between. There have been times when I was low, wouldn’t reply to people’s texts and would stay in my own shell. But watching you inspired me. It gave me strength and pushed me to do the right thing as I saw how you always found time to help, never complained or denied and how kind you were! Always be the helpful and considerate person you are! You will be a great mentor for juniors. Let’s stay connected and this time let’s have fun outside of work as well!
Tab tak ke liye… Tata.",Kanishka,True,60cf0bcf659165b3aa646542,Aviral  Singh
4,"Hi Deeksha, though maine HSS mein kaafi fraud maara tha, but doing HSS events with you during Galaxy and Freshers, especially DumbC and Tarq was really fun! You worked hard for it from the beginning itself. Apart from core courses, we did ENG123A together and got an opportunity to go to Rice University. Maybe if we would have gone, we would be able to get to know each other a little more but I am happy that we were able to briefly interact thanks to the quarantine in neighbouring rooms. 
You have a very calm, composed and pleasant personality. You are also hardworking, helpful and dedicated to your work. Perhaps you won’t, but I remember you offered me your chair during one of the HSS events in our first year. At that time I found it to be very warm-hearted and considerate. Always keep on caring for people the way you do. If possible, let’s spend some more time together in the following year. Aur tu chaapu toh hai hi and I know you’ll do great. Wish you a great future ahead.

5,"It has been great meeting you Durgesh - your care for your family and dedication towards work were very inspiring for me. The songs you shared, rasmalai, diwali night (and the way we made that dia), late night roaming in FB and writing on Prof’s board - all of it was really nice. You are a great friend to have and someone who cares a lot. I would like to hear you play violin sometime. And yeah, if possible, let’s stay in touch :) :).",Kanishka,True,60a5180f819323d199d4835d,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal
6,"Hi Harshit, we first interacted during TA201A lab. Phir baad mein toh we talked a lot. Thanks for helping me out in acads and during interns. GDs were really fun. Aur haan, SURGE attendance waala incident was quite a jolly and memorable one for me. After coming out of LHC, I wondered and laughed for quite a while ki kisne galti se lga di! Main nhi aati toh bhi chal jaata! 
And… Well… I did tell you we could stay friends. I even used to consider you a good friend. But after some time, things changed, maybe my behaviour also changed a little and you kind of stopped talking. But I have no ill feelings towards you. There is one little harsh thing I want to say - You shouldn't make fun of everything! However, the time we spent was nice. Toh… if it’s okay with you now, maybe we can talk sometime in future. Aur… tum chaapu toh ho hi and I am sure you will keep on excelling like this in future as well. Wish you a great and happy life ahead. Tata :)",Kanishka,False,60cf482f659165b3aa6465f9,Harshit  Verma
7,"Meri pyaariii roomiieee, IITK behen and my cry-mate, we only had each other even in our 1st semester (usse fights bhi boht hote the - raat ko lights ke liye, room ki safai ke liye, proper talking and living etiquette ke liye!). 1st year tera notes na dena yaad rahega mujhe 😛. Fir apni branch same ho gyi, batti club mein saath kaam kiye. Tune boht mehanat ki thi usme aur kitni saari ppts deni padi thi na (Uff!). IME mein kaam karne mein boht maze aaye par aur voh band bas tere hi haath pe fit aata tha (kha pi liya kar kuch aur moti ho jaa, mess mein saara khana waste kar deti thi!). I will miss those long late night talks we had about so many people and topics - especially about each other’s crushes and love life 😛! Hume ek doosre ke itne saare secrets pta na! Meko kai baar rote hue sambhala hai tune. Thanks for bearing with my repeating same talks about the same person😃😃! Meko taekwondo mein bhi toh tu hi leke gayi thi. Paper mein mere marks dekh ke aana, mera rebate fill karna and chappal almirah mein rakhne ke liye shukriya yaar! Apne TA ke group mein bhi boht bakwas ki apan ne - maze aaye. Fir truth… waali cheez! Kya kya hua hai na apne saath - ek baar toh tera fb account hi hack ho gya tha! Do you remember our 1st solo trip to oxidation pond? Tree pe chadhke photoshoot karwaye😁😁

Yaar 4 saal were really fun and it has been great being your friend❤️. You might seem a little selfish at start but that’s not true. You are a very emotional person who cares a lot about his friends’ feelings. Thanks for taking care of me all this time.

Haan yaar call pe baat nhi ki na last year. Abhi future me - we will stay connected and share a ton of secrets😁!",Kanishka,False,60a616bf819323d199d48a40,Jaya  Maheswari

9,"Srivastavvv, Sunyyy, meri pyaari presi, the one with the cutest smile ever - tujhe haste hue dekh kar hi hasi aa jaati hai. Meko abhi imagine karte hue bhi aa rhi 😁! Haan re, boht time saath bitaya hai humne jisme kaafi not to be disclosed here waali cheezein bhi hain. HEC mein toh tere bina mera pta nhi kya hota! RO and washing machines ka chapoda, mail cc-ed to director for fixing newspaper stands aur kaise bhool sakte - endsems ke time saath baith kar hum room allocate kar rhe the😂! Antaragni security, HSS recitations, DumbC moves and we also made posters together for Candle Light March. Tu meko kitni baar cycle pe bhi bithai hai aur do you remember hum baarish mein bhi bheege the! Boht dhyaan rakha hai tune mera 4 saal mein❤️. Tujhse campus mein ek saal baad milkar boht achcha lga. Thanks for making us maggie. We tried chopsticks for the first time🥢. 
All of it was really fun and even trying to write all the memories we have made would be overly unfair to them. You are someone who is mature but have a child-like side to her and who cares a lot, not just for her friends but for everyone. My dear friend, it has been an honour knowing you🖖. Aur haan… Initially I thought of you as an ambivert but perhaps you are more of an introvert. Toh dhyaan rakhna tu apna. And… it’s definitely not a goodbye. Itna jaldi peecha nhi chodeinge… Na na. Hum ghoomne nhi gaye hain - meko jaana hai. Let’s go for a trip soon.

10,"Haaannnn, hum dono haryana se hote hue bhi humari baat toh nhi hui last four years mein. Par meko apni 1st year ki CHM101 lab achche se yaad hai. Tum mujhse boht jyada haryanvi bolte the aur tu karke bolte the joh meko tab ajeeb lgta tha par koi same jagah se hai yeh dekhkar achcha bhi lgta tha. Overall the lab was fun and I found you very funny and a good person. Baad mein fir hum ek baar library ke aage mile the. Tab tum aise hi achanak se aake bole ki Y18 mein ek ladki Haryana se hai aur tum uska dhyaan rakhna, uski help karti rehana and thoda IITK ke baare mein bta dena. Phir yeh bol ke tum chale gye. Meko pehle boht ajeeb lga ki yeh achanak voh mujhe aake yeh kyon bol ke chala gya! But I liked to see that you cared for your juniors and it inspired me as well.

It was nice talking to you during the course and voh zoom waali chat (to everyone) was one of a kind… Yaad rahegi meko! I was kind of scared!

Aur.. Agli baar voh topi leke aate pakaa se. Abhi 1 saal bacha hai. Tum pehen ke ghumna. Milte dobara. Byee :) :)",Kanishka,True,60a5083b819323d199d4830b,Nikhil  Kumar
11,"Yo Buddu!
Practicing taekwondo in ground, doing stupid things, lying on the grass and laughing out loud was really fun. Kaafi masti ki club mein apan ne - especially with Simran and Hemant Bhaiya. Simran, tum aur main toh campus cycling trip pe bhi gye the and we took photos near the fountain. Aur haan, tumne mera important little rock kho diya tha (the day we went to give belt test in the bus) - won’t forget that😑! But koi na - it was a memorable day. We had a great time. 
It has been really nice having you as a friend😃. Have a wonderful life ahead! Wait… voh keyring bhi nhi di abhi tak tumne😑!

12,"Hi Nitish,

Hall 3 batti club aake kaam karna was really fun. Humari maximum interaction batti club ke through hi hui na - even our first meet writing arduino codes during winter camp. You resolved LAN problem in my laptop. Fir summer projects in e-club - though we were not in the same team, you helped us throughout our project. You have helped me a lot in these 4 years - resolving random errors in codes, my UGP, research, info about courses and many more. Do you remember Ganeshotsav - it was nice and prasad was really good! And did I ever tell you - I had a hard time believing when you told me you were in drams😛! Aur… how enthusiastic you were after becoming baapu - tumne apne bachchon se milwaya bhi! Keep caring, the way you do, for your juniors and people around you. 

I wish we could have spent some more time together. I still have the reusable paper, lens and smiley and learnt a lot from How to win friends and influence people!  You are a very honest, innocent and kind-hearted soul. It’s an honour to have you as a friend😃.

All the best for your future. Prof. banke students ko jyada bore mat karna (tumhare L12 mein FPGA ke lecture ke time hum so gye the😛)

14,"Hey S. Saxena!
From treasure hunt to nursery, though it was mostly during the group meets that we met and talked, the time would never have been as fun without you. Also, the good jokes - highly needed for balancing out Maitreyee and Navanya’s PJs, Uff! For the last 4 years, I have seen you as someone smart and caring with a great sense of humour. There was always this fellow feeling of comfort around you. People could relax, ease out and be themselves😃. And… well, I know you won’t mind - so... meko tum thode bade toh lgte the initially😛. The first long talk we had was when we went for a cycling trip. Later, the walk in the academic area with ghost stories (I was actually kind of scared that night). Also, the birthday planning and Antaragni night was fun. Aur haan, you were the only one who invariably said ‘yes’ for our group strolls.. It will always be remembered and appreciated😶😄. Last month of knowing you has been a pleasant delight. Hoping to carry through our fun plans for the future😁. See you soon. Tab tak ke liye… Tata
