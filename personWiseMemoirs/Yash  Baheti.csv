You have inspired me a lot throughout the campus journey. I have seen the true meaning of ""Aim so high that other people's goals are the basic minimum of your goals"". I don't think IITK has seen many people with more A*s than A. And the best part is you make it seem so effortless. 

Most people know you just by your acads but from what conversations we have had, I see you as a person with much more depth. You understand things, you know what you have to do and unlike many others, you actually do what you know you have to do! That's why I respect your work ethic and get inspired by it.

Let's make things happen! See you soon. 

PS: I will definitely be rooting for you as our PM. 😉",Yash  Baheti,False,60ce5ac4659165b3aa646476,Abhyuday  Pandey

4 words: ""Dil se acchaa Insaan""

This is what comes to my mind when someone mentions you. There are not many people around who are as selfless as you when it comes to friends and people who you care about. It feels great to be in that group. 

There hasn't been a time when I asked you for something and you didn't reply with ""Ho jaega na bhai!"". You have a lot of positivity and kindness in you bro and on top of that you are so chill and laid back. You truly enjoy each and every aspect of life to its fullest. Many people keep on postponing their happiness to the future, but you enjoy and remain happy in present. That's rare and I respect you so much for that. Always be like that because your kindness is enough to keep you successful wherever you go.

The world really needs more of you. xD",Yash  Baheti,True,60ce6122659165b3aa64647d,Anany  Sharma

Thanks for having my back during the intern :p

You are one of the most non-competitive people I have met on our campus. You help everyone like it's your job xD. (We will come to the job part later :P). And that's very rare and awesome Bhai. Always keep that up. 

I have seen your work closely and thus I admire your work ethic a lot. You are an asset to any company you work with and that's why I was so sure ki tera to ho hi jaega, all I had to do was to convince you to ""atleast de to de interviews"" :p

It has been real fun discussing everything from assignments to lectures to JIRAs to ITRs to Interviews to Investing. And I have learned a lot from you in the process.

You are one of the most authentic people I have met on campus. You drill through everything with sheer hard work and determination and at the same time you are so chill. I don't recall any time I saw you super stressed about anything. You are always in that chill and classy mood.

You carry a lot of positivity inside you and thus it feels safe and nice to be around you. I have always enjoyed all our interactions almost everywhere: kd, rm, wing, events ground, randoms Yo while crossing each other on cycle. 

PS: It was great that we finally met randomly after weeks of ""planning to meet"" :p

Lol, it has been fun seeing you around all over the campus, shouting ""Yo! Nice TShirt"", nodding and then going back to what we were up to.

My first memory of you is from orientation when you asked some doubt in some session (probably women's cell presentation). From then we worked a lot in ECell and had a lot of great conversations.

These 4 years were super fun around you. Lol, I have lost the count of assignments we have done together. And more than that the hours of debugging we have put in. I still got all our ""debugging successful"" pics! I never had to worry about any concept which I didn't understand in RM101 because I always had Room 316 as the backup. Really dude, acads were so stress-free because I had you around. Thanks a lot for that. 😄

I have seen you grow a lot in terms of dealing with people in the last 4 years. Good job! 😁

I really loved the times when we 3 used to go to the mess together, mock each other a bit, laugh a lot, then come back and play 3C2 chess matches! It was a home-like feeling, that 1/4th of the wing which we had for ourselves! Those days were super fun.

More than anything else, I have always loved our level of understanding about each other's thought process be it in a theoretical concept or a code or a life situation. We understand each other very well. That's why it's so easy to talk to you and explain to you and understand from you regarding literally everything. 

And lastly, in these 4 years, it's so easy to lose yourself and do things which you wouldn't have wanted to do just because everyone else around you is doing it. In that sea of people, I have always found you and Shobhit as my reference points, or more of an existential proof in not doing certain things which I didn't want to. Thanks for that grounding!

First of all thanks for the quant guidance! You were one of the most intelligent guys in our batch but at the same time one of the most humble guy too. You never let competition come in between when someone asked you for help in anything. That's super awesome bro. Your understanding of concepts was rock solid and at the same time you were very quick to understand any flaw in your understanding and accepted it very fast rather than ""arguing your point""..
