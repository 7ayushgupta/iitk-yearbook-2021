Probably the best roomie ever. And the 1st person in iitk who i interact with. I can’t bring even a single memory of 1st  year without you. You have always been the source of inspiration for me. That amount of effort, dedication, focus...i have a huge respect for you brother🙏🙏...bhai jitna mehnat tu krta tha n 1st year me, and the amount of belief you had in yourself, i knew ki you are definitely going to upgrade your department. And I was glad that you finally did it, and roomie k sath sath, we became department mates, which made me happier. 
And you are such a nice person yar, i really liked the way you used to interact with and show respect to others. I really learnt a lot from you. I still remember, when the result of 1st sem came, kafi kharab pointer the mere...i was really really sad, and you were the 1st person who came to me, provided me emotional support, and motivated me. Although iitk has provided us with a student guide, but mere liye tu hi guide tha. You won’t believe it, but I have saved your number as “Ali Sir’’ in my phone. You were really a huge inspiration for me, so thank you so much for this. 
Apni dosti k bare me kya hi btau, we were more than that. We were so emotionally connected yar...mtlb bina bole tumhe pta chal jata tha ki i’m not good. You were always the one jo hmesha puchhte rhta tha…”aur sb thik n mukesh''...and I felt really good whenever you used to ask this.
Kafi serious baate ho gyi😂...but apart from this, you were way too hilarious dude. Itne sare memorable moments diye hai n tune, kya btau...bhai wo raat ko tumhari bakchod harkate, and me and saini saying, calm down ali, calm down😂😂...especially that day, when i was watching some movies, you and saini were sleeping,  and suddenly your hand came directly over my face, saying bhai aag lgi hai, bhago😂...it was way more hilarious than being scared! Aur bhai hmara footballer bhi to hai...messi fan🙏❤️...but bhai messi hai wo, uske jaisa bnne ka kosis mt kro...yad to hoga hi tumhare sath kya hua tha😆...abe normal ankle twist se itna kaun chillaata hai...bhai tune game rukwa diya tha😅...aur bhai wo fifa ka din?? Wo bhi kya din the yar...bhai mujhe fifa khelna bhi tune hi sikhaya tha...aur fir bad me maine tujhe hi harane lga tha😝...trust me, nothing gives more happiness than defeating the one who taught you😀! Aur to aur, maine football me tumhare wajah se hi khelna start kiya tha...you used to say, bhai kafi mja aata hai, khela kro...aur kuchh bacha hai sikhane k liye?? Now you know why I consider you my guru! Bs ek chij aur sikha do...how to be so charming😍...yad hai wo, when we were discussing ki kaun si dept. me achhi bandi hai, and all..then you asked me baati dept. me koi acchhi nhi hai kya, and i said(making sad face), na yar...then you said abe search kro( ig you remember the name 😛)...bhai shakal se to tu bhola lgta tha...HSS club me yhi krne jate the kya tum😃...bhai uska memoir to likh do at least 😜.
At last, I want to say that there is a huge contribution of yours in being the type of person I am...You made my college life a lot easier...so, thank you so much for this...Please let me know if i could do anything for you...aur ab to tum M.S. krne wale ho...i wish ki you get the best university of world...all the best for your future...baate waate krte rhna...baki apna aur apne family ka khyal rkho...love u a lot💖💖...and take care!

Right from the beginning of college time, that one person who was always with me was you. I really feel very very lucky that you came in my life, and filled it with more and more joy and happiness.
You are the reason that I explored so much in these 4 years...chahe wo gym me paise barbad krne ho ya swimming me 😂...jokes apart, but you are the most kind-hearted and supportive person among all of my college friends. Bhai, kitne courses to tune smbhala hai...warna pta nhi kitne repeat krne pdte, pta nhi kitne quizzes miss hote. So thank you for all of this...and yes how can i forget that Control System paper...bhai itni daring🙏...dude, you showed me your answer sheet in front of the TAs...who does that!!! The most unforgettable memory will always be the ‘Rishikesh’ trip...we had so much fun there, yes Thank you for sponsoring me🤗...And who will forget our ‘Nainital Trip’...that accident bro(at around 6000 feet height)...still haunts me...I should have trusted your driving skills man...but all of them was fun. We enjoyed it. Also, during the last month of our college time, dare to message a random chapu girl on insta, and getting her on video calls within two f**king days, r u kidding me!! dude, i respect you 3000x now.
The last one and half month was not good for me. I got my foot fractured and I couldn't even walk. During these tough days, that amount of help and support bhai...I really owe you man (not money 🤪)...Thank you so much for all your help. We didn’t have our last photo together unfortunately, but I am coming to bangalore...macha denge bhai!
These four years were really amazing...IITK has given me a lot of things, but you are the most precious one. I really wish that our friendship remains forever. I just wish you good luck and achieve whatever you want to. Aur haa, foreign mt chale jana. IAS bano...and do something for our city, our state, and our country...They really need you. Best of luck for you journey ahead.

Hi Baby💓...i have called you the whole college time by this, i still call you by this, and will be calling you by this...hope u don’t get offended 🤪, like i used to get whenever you said something bad about Bihar😂. I don’t precisely remember how we started talking, probably during Antaragni when we all(wingies) went together. But, by 2nd sem, we were friends. During the 2nd sem, i don’t think we talked much apart from the aceds discussion, but our bonding started to increase when we went to ‘Rishikesh’ trip. We got to know each other better during the trip, and ofc we had a blast there. I also got to know that under 200 rank wale log bhi can be a real superchill guy🤘. Lekin bhai tujhe mere state se itna hate kyo hai bhai(laughing emoji), the people here are so good man. Pta nhi kitni bar nok jhok ho chuki hai hum dono k bich me, bihar k topic ko lekar. But do you know why our friendship continued even after so many nok jhok, bcz you are most sweetest guy. You are so good man. I know mai kafi bar offend bhi ho jata tha, but bhai tu thoda stats ki jankari rkha kr. Aur bhai tera confidence, bhai tere ghar me confidence k trees hai kya??? Itna kaise bhai...but this is what makes you unique...’the confidence of being an overconfident’. Don’t get affected by someone else, just be you. You are much better than what others think of you.
But bhai, ye FIFA ne jo bonding badhayi hai n hmari🙏...all thanks to FIFA...do u remember, how we used to play FIFA whole night...lunch miss...dinner miss...then raat ko roll order kro...puri raat khelo...subah quiz hai, kuchh nhi padha...fir bhi m** c****ye quiz..let’s play FIFA...it was crazy bro...you were so competitive bro😍...and bhai tujhe harake jo mja aata tha n...kya btau ….we played so many league matches yar...completing whole league matches in 2 days…(yad hai?maine arsenal liya tha, you took man city, and goel took man utd--his affection towards Lukaku😂)...we were insane bro...but bhai bhut mje aate the yar…those were the golden days yar, and i feel sad that those days are gone. Humlogon ne itna FIFA khela ki pta hi nhi chala ki when we became best friends from good friends.
 And, yes I consider myself very very lucky that I got a friend like you. You made my college life more amazing and exciting.I hope our friendship remains forever. I just don’t want to lose you man. And I’m sorry, mai goa trip pe nhi aa paya..but next trip plan kr, and consider me ‘in’ by default.Wish you a very bright future ahead. Also, I wish ki Messi doesn’t retire until you meet him..Andha paisa kmao...Meet your idol...and hme bhi milwao...I want to see how inhuman looks like, and will get some pictures with him.

Initially I thought...ya, seems like a nice guy...started talking...and eventually became good friends while helping each other in solving fiitjee booklets. U remember anshu? that fight between us...MTH publication k book ko leke...i refused to give it to you, and u stopped talking to me...was kidding man😂...and then we became very good friends. This made me realise ki with whoever i had a little nok jhok , they became very good friends of mine (kyo pandey aur piyush 😂). We got so lucky bhai….same batch at FIITJEE, both repeated for JEE, again got in the same institute and batch(Parth Ranker ROCKS(rock emoji)), and fortunately got in the same college and even the same hall bhai💗...everything happened in favor of our friendship. And I feel very lucky that you are one of my friends, and trust me, you have a very special place in my life🤗. I mean it needs a lot of effort to maintain any type of relationship, and I respect you a lot for all your efforts to keep our friendship going.

You might not want it to happen again, but trust me, this will be the reason for your name and fame!

And, ofc how can we both forget that traumatic period of my life😢...man i just can’t tell how i would have been if u were not there. I am really really thankful to you bhai. And thanks to you for making me start all the nashe things😜...it really feels amazing. Kuchh nashe bache hai, but i know ki tu uski bhi aadat lgwa dega. But, how could I forget that Nainital trip man. Bhai, mai maut ko takk se choo k wapas aa gya tha...it was scary..but i really enjoyed it man. The funniest trip was our regular Patna trip. Sutta fukna at every Patna trip. Jb bhi tum patna aate the, ek lambi list hoti thi tumhare pas, of all the street-food and their locations.Jha bhi jao, ‘paisa wasool’ ki responsibility tum lete the. Bhai, to ek din bhukha aata tha, paisa wasool krne k liye. and ghar jakar pta chlta tha ki you have gained 5 kgs of weight...i mean are you for real??? And itne khane wale bnde ko achanak se diet follow krna, i can’t believe my eyes. Jo bhi ho, you are following it strictly, and yes huge respect for this. Aur bhai, wo 85 kg wali bet ko jyada serious mt le yar, gareeb aadmi ko jeene nhi doge kya😂. The most hilarious and memorable trip to Patna was of course Jan’21. First of all, you should thank me for making you lose your weights, and saving your auto ka kiraya😜. We did so much kand bhai...you know that!

Nothing would be a better start than one of the happiest moment of your life...GATE exam result...under AIR 50 rank...cmon yar, itna kaun chapta hai bhai😯...and so humble, at the same time🙏.
Such a nicest human being yar...i think everyone should have a friend like you...i don’t really remember when we talked first time, but who cares if we are already such a good friend. Aur bhai you were probably the only one among our group to have bandi🤪(i know yo still have😂). Mtlb ekdum chapu yar🙏..thoda dost log ko bhi time de diya kro yar😜...tumhara room me to gyani baba hi the bhai(laugh), so lucky! I guess ki tune baba ko ignore kiya hoga😅...we got along so much yar...tu jyada to sports nhi khelta tha...but whenever you played badminton or volleyball, i truly enjoyed it. Not only this, you were always there whenever I was a bit confused about my life, and sometimes I used to share my problems with you, so thanks for listening and also for giving me the best possible advice. You will always be one of my mentors.  Aur bhai last 2 months of our college life, kya mja aaya yar...playing cards till morning...bhai itne dimag lga k kaun khelta hai cards...you are a CARD game champion bro(in real life too)...itne analysis!!my god🙌...and it was also bad time for me as  i broke my leg, i couldn’t even walk...during these bad days, bhai you were always there...mai jitna bhi sukriya ada kru, km hai🙏🙏. There are a lot of memories that we shared but the Rishikesh trip will always be in my heart...the best trip, which definitely wouldn’t have been if u were not there. I hope ki we do more such trips in future. So, thankyou for everything, and will always be there for you. Best of luck for your future and  have a very great time ahead...love you bro💖💖.",Mukesh  Kumar,True,60c250bc659165b3aa645f78,Vipin
