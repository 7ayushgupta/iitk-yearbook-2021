Thanks for staying with us in A100, will always remember those times.

You were the most chilled out and cool guy of our wing. Have knowledge and opinion about everything out there. I remember the summer day when I stayed in your room, that orient cooler I still remember, felt like air conditioner. Mostly you could be found in the canteen or in GH ;-) It was great interacting with you man! Hope to meet you soon. All the best for all your future endeavours.

3,"Yo Roomie!! Kaisa hai. 
Ha to humne saath me hi campus life enjoy kra. we used to make fun of each other, you believed that I sometimes think like your mom, partying in Gulab singh, enjoying antaragini, silent disco, playing tekken, wishing to go gym/jogging from next morning everyday, Bhai tu subah utha ni pata tha yaar, sudhaar le iss harkat ko. 
Aur bhi bahut saari yaadein hai kabhi milenge to yaad krenge. Wish you the best of luck in all of your future endeavors. Hope to see you soon bro.",Shreyash  Raj,True,60c6538d659165b3aa6462c8,Rajat  Ghoshal

5,"Yo Prateek!!,
You were one of the most organised guy I met in the campus, both in your works and your thoughts. The kind of hardwork you did was always inspiring for us and we used to discuss this that we have to work like him. I remember the time when we were going to canteen at midnight you were mostly on your way to KD or RM. But at the same time you used to enjoy a lot as well, you were always there in any of the wing parties. 
so aise hi machate rho, hope to meet you soon and all the best for all your future endeavours.

7,"Yo Vipin!!
First time we met when you came to A100 searching for Ali then jo uss din tumne itni lambi kahani sunaayi apni first sem drop ki mtlb kahani lambi ni thi but tum suna rhe the to lambi hogi hi ;P  then after branch change I realized how lucky I was to meet you. Bro you are very helpful, anyone with any kind of problem can approach you and you can give him (or her, mostly her I think) an hr of gyaan on any topic. Maine bahut baar pareshaan bhi kiya tumhe but you were kind enough to ignore them. Humne kayi saari outings, movies, parties saath kari, campus khulne pr milte hai aur bulla kaat te hain.
All the best.",Shreyash  Raj,True,60cf3273659165b3aa6465b0,Vipin
