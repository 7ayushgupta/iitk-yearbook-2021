I first interacted with you during Eclub winter camp of my second year.  You were among the participants and I was taking the lecture.  Hope that those lectures were beneficial for you. We might have not interacted that much but I recall that we had shared a flight journey to Mumbai together sometime during midterm break of third year. You had mentioned that you were travelling here to see your relatives although your home was at some other place.  
We also did some common courses in 7th sem and you used to call me at late night before assignment submission.  I hope that my help proved useful to you and you managed to do well in those courses.

You were one of the most studious wing mates I had in first year. I remember that I had stayed back in my first semester midsem break.  You too had stayed back and you used to visit CC often during the break as we weren't allowed laptops during first semester. I always enjoyed discussing academic related doubts with you. In second year, you branch changed to EE.  You were one of the persons I looked forward to discussing assignments related stuff in EE.   
Now your interests may have changed after your sem exchange in Aalto.  
I hope that you did well in your research.
Would look forward to interact with you further over topics of common interests.
All the best for your future endeavours.

I came in touch with you through Eclub. I recall our time together in InterIIT tech meet 2018 at IIT B.  We had participated together in the Engineers conclave.  That day spent with you and Jay was really fun.  I was expecting you to continue in Eclub as a coordinator from Hall 5.   In 4th sem, we did our TA202 project and ESO203 lab together.

I was fortunate to have you as my roommate in first year.  I remember that our room 324 and Ashok's bed in the middle was mostly occupied by Apurv who used to bring all the electronics stuff in our room.  We went through the ups and downs in our first-year courses together. I remember that your 1st sem endsem exams had got over before mine and I had two papers left but with a gap of 3-4 days.  You, me, and Ashok had watched around 7 movies together that night before my exam.   Some of them which I remember well are ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"", ""The Arrival"", ""Lucy"". I became so engrossed in having fun that night, I did not do any practice for TA101 lab exam and ended up with the only B grade in my first sem.  

We lost contact after our first year when both of us decided to change roommates.  Even our rooms were on the two extremes of 4 mid wing. I hope that you did well after your first year. Hope that we might connect sometime in the future. All the best for your future endeavors.

Our interaction was mostly limited to our second year when you were secy in Eclub. We had helped each other a lot in 3rd sem courses. I specifically remember that I used to be overloaded with many activities in 3rd sem. I and Soumya had a deadline of TIIDC challenge and we also had ESC201 quiz the next day. You had helped me that night by sharing some assignment solution and I could solve a similar question that appeared in the major quiz.  You might have saved my grade for ESC201!

It was great to have you as a fellow core team member of SnT council.  We jointly organized many events in SnT council.  Eclub and Roboclub did not go along very well sometimes.

Although we were a part of Eclub since our first year, I really felt connected to you during the period before coordi interviews.  I recall that we were given several tasks like club cleaning and bringing in new furniture. These were the first tasks that we did together as prospective coordinators (All thanks to Abhigyan who made us collectively do these tasks to build our bonding). 

You are the most creative person in our club. You were the face of Eclub managing the important role of publicity. Your poster designing skills are amazing.  I recall you taking a lot of effort to create the poster for the E4U initiative. Almost all posters and website designing were managed by you.  Your name will go down in history for redesigning the club website (https://students.iitk.ac.in/eclub/).   

Although our last meet was before covid pandemic started, we have been connecting virtually on various occasions. The last time we connected was for the Eclub coordi interview for Y19 batch. Hope that we will reunite some time in the near future. All the best for your future endeavors.

Thanks for being a part of my journey here.
We met first time in the E club winter camp. I recall that our first project together was creating an egg basket game in processing software where the basket was controlled using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. We also made an application using Android Studio. 

I am amazed by your knowledge of places to visit on the campus. Before I met you, I was not aware of sites like the oxidation pond behind OAT and the IIT K nursery at the end of the road to the auditorium. 

I was glad that you continued in the E club after the summer project on Skin Track. We jointly conducted many events for the club. Even after your tenure as a secy was over, you remained in touch with club activities. I recall that you had borrowed the LED strip from the club to celebrate your friend's birthday. You are really good at organizing surprise birthday celebrations for your friends. I recall that you had planned my birthday celebration in the Lecture Hall complex in my third year (However, it was not a surprise for me since you had invited Apurv, who leaked the info about your planning)


Although we didn't do many courses together, the one course we did together was the ENG course by Prof Ravichandran on ""Literature and the Individual."" I recall that we had rehearsed the debate of Kafka's "" The metamorphosis."" The debate was supposed to be on the spot, but prof never realized that we had decided our points-counterpoints beforehand! 

It is great that you, too, have plans to pursue graduate studies in the US. I hope that we will meet sometime soon. I will be happy to help you with your grad school applications.

Our interaction started with collaborating on the problem statement by BARC in our first Techmeet at IIT B. Remember those nights that we spent together in Hall 12 sitting in front of PIR sensor. Some funny events that I recall during our presentation at IIT B was the cup of tea spilling on the judge which led to our team getting extra time for the presentation.  The best part was our chat on the messenger group with Suraj, Abhigyan, Ashok. Might go through the chat to relive the experience of Techmeet once again !

The next memorable part was our second trip to Mumbai for presenting the prototype to BARC. We were fortunate to have connected with our alumni Sumit Chowdhury who later met us in Hall 12 canteen during his visit to IIT K.

We were really hoping to get a gold medal for the Roorkee edition by BARC/ Alphonso.
Unfortunately, this event was a closed-door event and we missed all the fun that we had in Mumbai. 

We have been through ups and downs together in our Eclub journey. Thanks for always supporting me in my crazy visions for club. One last thing that we missed was our project on Crazyflie which had to be discontinued due to covid. Our batch will be remembered as the one which revolutionized the club. Not only did we bring in new initiatives, we also renovated the club and redesigned the club website.

You have been very helpful to me several times. In particular, I remember borrowing your bicycle many times when my bicycle was not in a proper shape. You used a weird chain lock on your cycle which was very heavy to carry around. 

In lecture halls, we have shared neighboring seats in all examinations of EE courses (In first-year Institute compulsory courses, Nitik had a seat between us).  You were always the first person with whom I discussed the exam paper.  Some of our exams were really bad ( Remember EE210 Endsem !)

I am fortunate that you used to borrow my notes before exams and create a scanned copy of those notes. Thanks for keeping a soft copy of my notes on your phone.

I am glad that I met you at IIT K in our second year. We have been through several ups and downs together (especially third sem and fourth sem). We connected first time through Eclub. Remember the time when ERA was being founded. Most of our time together in second year was spent in Prof Behera's lab, EClub and later at Hall 12 ERA room / Suraj's room.

We had also collaborated in TIIDC. You had accompanied me in finding a faculty mentor the day before deadline. The funniest part of TIIDC was recording the video. You have supported me in all of my crazy ventures.
Another crazy venture was a blog written from the interview with Prof Venkatesh. 


The one unique thing that you taught me was sending GIFs on Facebook messenger. Our chat is full of GIFs.

You really manage your time well. You took several leadership roles simultaneously in SnT council. You led several problem statements at INTER IIT 8 and 9 and brought glory to Eclub, SnT council and IIT K. Continue to inspire the future generation of SnT council !

We will continue to connect with each other especially on occasions related to club and council.  Hope that all four of us will get a chance to reunite some time in the future.

All the best for your future endeavors.

36,"Hi Sunamya,

 We connected first time in TRC's course on ""Literature and the individual"" in 6th sem.  We shared many funny moments in TRC's class.  Although the course was left off-way (half-way) due to covid, we still managed to read the novel Hotel Silence by Auður Ava Ólafsdóttir and write a term paper.  Hope that you realized the purpose of your life after reading this novel and other short stories in the course.

Our paths might be very different now.  Hope that we will connect sometime in the future to relive the TRC chapter.  All the best for your future endeavors.

37,"Hi Tarish,

You are among the one at IIT K whom I know the longest.  We know each other since class 8. We were together for the Young Scientist exam coaching class by Kotwal ma'am. After that, we joined Vidyalankar for Physics Olympiad classes.  Are you in touch with our mutual friends from Vidyalankar? 

You were the coordinator of the coolest club in SnT council. I remember the night that I spent in Astro club when collaborating for a SnT council proposal.
Thanks for allowing Eclub to conduct one of our secys meets at Astro club.
I wish that I could have spent more time at Astro Club.

It is great that you pursued your liking towards Physics and Astronomy at IIT K. I recall that you had medals in Astronomy Olympiads before joining college. Although I don't know much about astronomy, radio astronomy sounds cool as it has a bit of intersection with electrical engineering. I recall that you too, had collaborated with the Microwave lab in EE for one of your projects. 

Physics and electrical engineering have a good amount of intersection. Hopefully, our paths might cross again in the future.

If you are in Thane, we might meet up sometime.

All the best for your future endeavors.

38,"Hi Tushar,

I hope that you recall our first project together. The ""Smart Dustbin"" is still in my room at Hall 3.  Could you share the Youtube link of the video that we made for presenting our Smart Dustbin in Eclub winter camp?  We had also won an RPI0  which is still at Eclub.  I enjoyed the time that I spent with you, Anshul, and your other Bhai's. Sometimes, I envy you that Abhigyan was your bapu.  We later also did the FPGA project in summers.  

We did not interact much after our first year. Hope that I get a chance to connect with you, Anshul, your bhais and Abhigyan sometime in the future. All the best for your future endeavors.

39,"Hi Vakul,

Although we knew each other since first year,  our true bonding was during Prof. Ravichandran's course on ""Literature and the individual"" in 6th sem.  We shared many funny moments in TRC's class.  Although the course was left off-way (half-way) due to covid, we still managed to read the novel Hotel Silence by Auður Ava Ólafsdóttir and write a term paper.  Hope that you realized the purpose of your life after reading this novel and other short stories in the course.

Our paths might be very different now.  Hope that we will connect sometime in the future to relive the TRC chapter.  All the best for your future endeavors.

40,"Hi Yash, I got introduced to you as Naishadh's roommate initially.   In third and fourth semester, I used to often visit Hall 12 for work related to ERA.  Our interaction was mostly related to EE courses.  You have helped me and Mudit many times during EE380 labs to complete them on time by showing your lab readings.  You also have a systematic method of storing all course material.  Whenever any junior student asks for course material, I will always direct him to Yash Maheswari's google drive link!  
I wish we could have interacted more.
All the best for your future endeavors
Stay in touch!",Nitish Vikas Deshpande,True,60c36359659165b3aa64621b,Yash  Maheshwari
41,"Hi Yasharth, 
Nice to hear from you after a long time.
It is great that you remembered me for writing a memoir to represent EE dept.
I recall that you branch changed to EE after first year.  We went through the ups and downs of EE departmental courses together. I especially remember the EE 210 course and we discussing whether we will get C/ D as our score was very poor.  Thankfully, instructor did relative grading and we managed to get B in that course. I know that you hated EE courses but still managed to do well by studying at last hour.  I hope that you would have found an area of interest outside EE and excelled at it.  I wish you the best for your future endeavors. Keep in touch!",Nitish Vikas Deshpande,True,60c36665659165b3aa64621e,Yasharth  Bajpai
