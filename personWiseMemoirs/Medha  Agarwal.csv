0,"I know you are everyone's Sontu but IDK why I think I have spent more time calling you Chotu, just for the irony of it. 
Yaar first year would have been impossible without you. Sab saath mein kiya - padhai, ELS, TA, aero, and of course A-603 ki mastiya.  ""Medha tumhare room mein bois hai"" always cracks me up, but it was so true; tu hota toh that hamesha. Thanks for getting me through ESC101; you know all about my syntax errors. You'll be glad to know woh abhi bhi hai. SC-II ki labs mein same harkate karti thi :P
I'll miss those Antaragini nights, random NH-91 dinners, and of course OAT hangouts. Those two years wouldn't have been fun without you.

I know we grew very much apart after the second year. To an extent, ki jab campus mein the toh samajh nahi aa raha that ki kya hi bolu. I am sorry for the distance. If I could go back in time, maybe I'll try to fix some mistakes. I knew you as the guy jo MTH mere se padhke, mere se zyada number lata ha and look what you have achieved now. Just keep paddling upwards like this. Kya yaar, I recall Goa mein apna drunk heart to heart interrupt ho gaya that. Koi nahi, another time!

I hope we meet again and relive those fun ""boondi ke laddu wali ice cream"" nights in Bangalore again. ",Medha  Agarwal,True,60a6abf6819323d199d49174,Aditya  Sonthalia
1,"Yo God! 
Yaar to this day I can't stop laughing at how much you resemble the Monkey King. I remember the first time Sonthalia introduced us, I took him away and whispered ""yaar yeh toh ekdum monkey king jaisa hai."" I remember how I crashed your and GJ's initial library date (when you weren't dating :P) and told her the monkey king thing. Thankfully, she didn't mind the similarity warna kya hi hota tera! :-)

I love how happy you always are and tend to dissipate that thing in every group. I have come out of our every conversation thoroughly amused and in complete awe of you. It was fun organizing GJ's birthday with you while you were fretting about doing the decorations all wrong. Chal I got a sick fire hazard story in return. Mujhe toh bohot maza aaya. 

I wish we could have interacted more on campus but jab bhi mile it was one memorable experience. Teri respect bhi bohot hai and tujhe dhamki bhi de rhi hoon - khayal rakhna meri bestie ka, bohot pitega warna. I really wish we meet again sometime. At least Singapore ghuma toh dena hi whenever I visit.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60a6a160819323d199d49139,Anany  Sharma
2,"Sorry for ruining your sacred memoir count, but well here it goes. 

I found how great a person you are quite late and that upsets me, but I am just glad that I got to spend some time with you. I have been told by many about what an awesome person you are, but it was even better to experience it in person. You surely are a warm friend who cares a lot about people. We were all sad the day we came to know that we had to leave campus, but I could see you welling up. It churned my heart bad. It was so fun hanging out with you in Goa. You are that one person who makes people instantly comfortable around you. In a day or two, while being massively drunk, I couldn't help hugging you and talking about god knows what. You shouldn't be encouraging that kind of behaviour, but well with your warm personality, you do, not my fault. You didn't see me off the day I left! Hence, you owe me a meet-up madam! 

P.S. It wasn't only the 6th floor when I sneaked away after seeing you guys. Let's just say that there are more 'incidences'.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60cf8f6d659165b3aa6468a3,Ananya  Goswami
3,"I have had different opinions at different points of time about the girl called Avisha on campus, who I often forget also happens to be my CS-approved 'behen'. Here are the interesting ones - Avisha doesn't talk much, Avisha talks a lot, Avisha has an insane number of people in her life, Avisha is super cool, Avisha is a great listener, Avisha has weird but insane ideas of fun, Avisha is great to gossip with, and the list goes on. All the opinions have stemmed from spending time with you and I can safely say that I cherish all of them. It's sad that I did not get to be a part of your life for a long time on campus, maybe due to the geographical positioning, I dunno. But I am so glad that starting from randomly sitting with you and Priya on CCD tables, we developed a bond that morphed into something very special during the last two months on campus. 

You are right, ""Medha coffee peeyegi kya?"" is the official summary of our friendship. With absolutely no need for coffee but in need for good company, I walked to your room with my green mug. I remember the day I randomly knocked on your door for tape and we ended up talking for hours, having coffee, and then hanging out in UC after that. Let's just say that the warm-up I had done before that never came to fruition. But here is my take-away from the futile warm-up incident - you are insanely easy to talk to. The kind of person I know myself to be, I don't open up that easy and pour out my heart out in front of someone. But not only are you an incredible listener, you are so fun to talk to. The night we spent on RM 6th floor talking about friends, family, and campus assholes, I have never related to anyone this much on campus. It's almost unbelievable we weren't aware of this before, otherwise who's to say, we would have been a blast! He he. I don't imagine it would have been easier to talk to someone for 5 hours straight and completely dump Ayush into oblivion, with anyone else.

I loved our Cosplay parties, gossip sessions, reels, etc etc. You are no easy dough for teaching dance but I am so proud that you pulled through. LOL. I am not going to enumerate all the times I have appreciated the kind of person you are but know that you're a bright one Let's meet soon I have got more stories for you and I know you want them. You're dying for them. ",Medha  Agarwal,True,60cf9732659165b3aa6468df,Avisha
4,"Let's do something before I can wrap my head around writing you a socially adequate (a bit slippery on the definitions there) memoir.

How about I bake you a cake tomorrow, cut it in two halves, smear Nutella on one half and blueberry jam on the other. We'll have our respective halves with wine while I tell you how much you matter to me. In my opinion, that is the memoir you deserve. Nonetheless, this is just to convey it permanently on you wall that life is good because there is a possibility of this happening today, tomorrow, and the day after :)

While I don't make life with me easy, I hope I at least make it beautiful enough.

5,"I don't know why your name, in my mind, rings in complete sync with ""insanely laborious"". How do you find such inhuman passion for getting your work done, woah!
Kaafi time spend kiya saath mein and all was huge fun seriously. AUV was both awesome and fun because of you. You always inspired me to go the extra mile then. Do you remember that we spent first year Antaragini together? I had completely forgotten that somehow. For me the memories go far back till AUV, that's it. 

I still can't stop laughing when I think of how we were sitting in the sun beside IITM swimming pool with me holding an umbrella while you were running the bot, constantly getting electrocuted mind you XD. And of course there could have been no better way of guilt watching Hunger games, all parts in a row, than in the train to Chennai. LOL that was insane. It was fun watching you half-ass through ENG courses. I wish I would have helped but then you wouldn't developed that sacred hatred for ENG courses, right?

Good luck with life and hope we cross paths soon I am looking forward to some interesting life stories from you.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60cfba45659165b3aa646920,Ayush Gupta (S Gupta)
6,"---------------- The contents below are a product of nostalgia and adoration, and therefore can include severe cringe. Beware!! ----------------

In Class XI, I saw a curly-haired guy who'd walk into my class during breaks and goof around like anything. It's a shame that we did not talk then, to the extent that until the time we found each other getting drenched in the rain during orientation, I didn't even know you were coming to IITK! Never did I know that that guy would turn out to be the best (and very insane) brother I could have ever asked for. The campus wouldn't have been half as fun as it was without you. 

Before making you all weepy by recalling our best memories, I need to say this - you have such a unique influence on your friends that makes them jump up from their inertia-seats and do some Bhavy-fun. I appreciate how you lift my spirit even in the worst times and make every problem look insignificant. I know we have had our fair share of RR, but some unsaid understanding of 'this shall pass' between us makes us joke about them while being knee-deep in life's shit. It is insane how at one moment you are this idiotic chotu who makes me facepalm at a frequency of 50 Hertz, and at the next moment, you are talking sense into me like a zindagi-ke-dard--know-it-all. After six years of knowing about your existence and three years of 'knowing' you, I can safely say that I love you enough that I am never letting you get rid of me.  Peace.

While you are supposed to reminisce your memories with someone here, I can't think of them in a finite number. But here are some campus ones that are absolutely close to my heart - sending fifty-odd gaalis to each other every day for absolutely no reason, helping you out when you were getting your ass kicked in PSO and pulling those all-nighters, bouncing into you in RM every day, our trips (with much-loved third-wheeling :-), and of course Hall-5 badminton. Remember how you highjacked that king-sized bed I wanted in Kochi? For the sake of other readers' sanity, I am going to skip the part where I talk about the methodology employed, but man, you skipped death that day. 

Surviving lockdown would have been impossible without you. I would always look forward to us randomly crashing each others' place. From the first (and a very awkward :-) visit to my place to multiple weekly visits during the lockdown, and finally, to me crashing at your place for some 15 odd fucking days, it is incredible how you are the first person who comes to mind whenever I am sad and need some cheering up. You made the college end not suck and even fun with all the karaoke, Bipasha, patte-sutta, jooooms, and my cutting-edge cooking. It was fun man. Thank you for being you.

P.S.: You lost it super easy on the dinner bet. Kya paneer ki toh season kara that :) Anyways, looking forward to it!",Medha  Agarwal,True,60c233a8659165b3aa645b23,Bhavy  Singh
7,"Arre yaar. This is going to be the mooooossst difficult one. I know I am supposed to call you. But now you see the issue - the fact that you are just a ring away whenever anything (literally 'bas accha nahi lag rha yaar' types anything) happens in my life, makes writing this memoir difficult. And here is the second, and the most pronounced one - writing a memoir allows one the creative freedom to be real and appreciative, even in the cringiest way possible. That baby, is our everyday natural. Here is what's gonna happen - I am going to write some profoundly sentimental things, you are. going to call me cringey, and then you are going to internally cry your heart out while missing me. 

I don't think I have had as adventurous a journey with anyone on campus as I have had with you. It is insanely hilarious to think of the time when I was legit afraid of you craziness. But we know now what lies beneath it - the most sensitive friend one could ever ask for. I have witnessed you change immensely and I am glad I have been a part of that change. I cannot be prouder of all that you have achieved, the fiercely independent opinions you have, the insane amount of empathy, and loads and loads of inhuman craziness you continue to possess. There are three types of people - first are those who scare away easy (amen for them), second are those you begin to appreciate your craziness, and the third are those who not only appreciate it but also get to be your FRIEND. I am so glad I am the third one but I am equally happy that I got to experience all three at some point before converging to the third one. 

You are the first friend I had in our branch (I don't count Priya in, woh toh dhokebaaz hai). Beginning from that purely academic acquaintance and despite the gross betrayal of secluding me from the wing, we have come a long way. When I look back at the journey, I can't stop welling up in nostalgia. You have a brilliant personality that is fun and warm at the same time. While it is impossible to not have fun with you with the constant inflow of gossips and inappropriate jokes, it is equally impossible to not confide in you whenever shit happens in life. I cannot exactly point out when, but as far back as I can remember, my instant go-to reaction whenever anything happens is ""talk to Gunjan, she'll know what to do"". I sort your sentences in a class, but you sort my head whenever stuff goes downhill. Be like this always. 

I know you have always had my back. Be it dealing MTH courses or assholes in life. I could only get through Maths courses because of you. I remember sitting in your room and just studying, sometimes not saying anything for hours. There was this unsaid pact that whatever happens, we'll help each other out. Countless number of times, whenever it was overwhelming, your room was just a knock away and help was just ""arre yaar yeh nahi ho raha"" away. Before going to RM, I had to know where you were. I am no stalker, lol, but it was just a habit to know where you were. Raat ko room aake, it just became a habit to check whether you were back yet and I remember a mild feeling of disappointment whenever you weren't. 

While in lockdown for a complete year, you were pretty much the only person I constantly talked to. It was just sheer comfort, the possibility of being completely real with you. You have been the one person who has made an effort to know what's up in my life, kyunki you know mein khudse batati nahi zyada :) This thing alone has always made it easy to talk to you about literally everything - trauma, dirty secrets, crushes, misunderstood feminism, lol the list goes on. I have learned so much about friendship alone from your friendship. I know I don't thank you enough for that, cause bhaav badh jaayenge duh, but many a times I have been in complete awe of how you make so many people so comfortable around you. You mold yourself to be the best version of friend one requires at a given time. I know I can always count on you without getting judged, except for my lameness of course. 

It doesn't happen very often with humans but I have found genuine happiness flush over your face on my achievements. I have seen you getting genuinely concerned whenever stuff goes bad in my life. How you do it, I still don't get but it is responsible for the kind of bond we have. I can go on and on about what a bright person you are but I'll spare your ego some massaging. Thanks for stopping by in my room every night at 11:30, whatever devilish reasons you might have for that. I loved our pointless hand wrestling, movie nights, mocktails turned cocktails, or just conversations  that went on for hours and hours. 

The two months on campus that we got in the end were just precious beyond measure. I knew I could just hang out in your room morning, evening and night. Sitting in a group, it is always fun to know with an eye contact about who we are going to talk about later. LOL. Quarantine would have been impossible without you. Jis din tu jaa rhi thi VH, sacchi rone ka man kar raha tha. I knew I wouldn't get to hang out with you for the very long time. Of course there was a possibility of you dying, but meh. But uske baad, we pickled up where we left. I loved how we discussed the people we would hang out with every morning and then report back every night. Even while being insanely drunk, I knew you were 'trying your best' to look out for the 10-rupay-mein-bhand me. Also I just screamed ""Ayush stope me, likhe jaa rhi hoon!!!"" LOL. Also stop saying ""Medha tu meri best friend hai"" every time you get drunk. I have eaten, digested, and assimilated that fact. Now just worry about meeting me ASAP before I leave. For the record, even though I don't believe in superlatives, you are my closest friend for sure. 

Milte hai jaldi! I am still holding you to that one trip That's all I am asking for, one trip with you. Damn it woman! Make it possible, soon.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60cf7d9b659165b3aa646767,Gunjan  Jalori
8,"I remember the first time we met properly in the Inter IIT DebSoc event. While, as you know, I have many opinions about the the set of people I met there (some grossly generalising), you were an outlier even then. Just a fun-loving and fun-imparting guy even in the most anxiety-inducing places such as a parliamentary debate. In a room full of people pretending to know more shit than they do, you came goofing around with your little Star Wars (Trek?, lol I dunno) presentation. It was super super fun. I know many have called you arrogant/inapproachable in the first year, however, I have always found an excessively warm friend in you from the starting. 

I am so happy that we became friends outside the zone of our first exposure. The Kushagra then for me was a branch-mate. The Kushy now is a remarkable friend. I guess we have to thank stats for it. Right from the start of our first Bayesian project, I have found myself extremely comfortable in your company. Bugging you every millisecond with a ""yaar code nahi chal raha"" doubt and writing that (horrible :) Word project report with you was a foundation of a great friendship. I am so glad it did not end there. In fact our journey has crossed path, shared paths, and sometimes even borrowed paths. 

I know I haven't said this much, or at all maybe, but you are someone whose energy has guided my life at IITK immensely. You are brilliant in what you do, but the best part about you is that you never made me feel scared of that. It was intimidating at times, but you always extended a warm friendly support.  You were always like ""arre aise kar le na"", ""arre ho jaayega"", "" tu toh kar legi"". In hindsight, this encouragement kept me going many a times. From the day you helped me write my first ML assignment code in RM, the list has been going on. I know you are responsible for a lot of stuff that we have done together to become the MTH Stats-duo (like you said AA and GJ are way behind in the league). Bayesian project, talks, DV's projects, mentoring projects, and on and on. I knew I could just dive right in whenever you came with an idea to do something together. I knew I'd learn a lot and have limitless fun. Thanks for being such an amazing and inspiring friend. And I know this is not just for me. You are in general an insanely lanky person who brings 'inspiration wrapped in friendship' in people's lives. Always be like that. Once someone can get over your lankiness and the fact that you find the idea of eating humans quite glorious, you are a pretty darn awesome human (?). 

Even though you'll be forever be in debt of my notes, the trade was only fair with the awesome company you provided me in the Stats classes. I loved doing Prob theory assignment on RM boards and sitting in stochastic classes together. Life was fun in third year because of you. Okay I am done vibing over Maths and Stats. Some more content ahead.

I don't know how but talking to you is so easy. I can go hours and hours chatting with you, ON TEXT! Otherwise itna patience nahi hai mujhme. Even though I take pride in being a great listener, for me, the trophy would any day go to you. I have found an empathetic listener in you who always knows the right things to say at the right time. You are not the ""sab theek ho jaayega"" or ""chill maar na"" guy. You are someone with whom after a four hours of conversation, you come out feeling good even i life is shit. You were the first one I have 'wanted' to talk to when I am immensely confused or upset. After Millie, the first time I felt completely okay was after talking to you. Goa ke baad, you were the first one I talked to. I just feels right, always. And man do you know big secrets about me due to that. Uhmmmm, dare you!

I am so glad we did the Goa trip together Also thanks for getting (fighting) me in it. LOL. I have so many more things i should thank you for - grad apps, thoughtful birthday audiobooks, etc etc but I know I don't need to. Because this is not end This is just the beginning baby. I am holding you on to being an awesome friend in the US too. Stay the friend who gives me Hannibal trauma fevers and the one who saves my ass literally everytime. 

P.S. I don't mind being the Mishra of Atleast 6. I bring out the creative in you and that's why I am awesome He he.",Medha  Agarwal,True,60cf6d03659165b3aa6466ab,Kushagra  Gupta
9,"Aur lodu, kya haal chaal.
I have lost track of the gaali I am using to address you currently, but this should do. Don't get big on ego after reading whatever lies ahead. I am still expecting you to call me one fine day and say ""aur Shikanji, kya chal raha hai"". 

The first memory I have of you is during NTSE celebration where someone informed me that there is a new NTSE boy in the JEE-infatuation town. Since then, I don't know how, but you were this goofy kid who turned into pretty much the only friend I had there. It's true that the friendship involved a lot of leg-pulling almost all the time, but I have made peace with that being the default setting now. I am glad that even before coming on campus, you were a friend I could always trust on. I was so disappointed the whole time I thought you wouldn't come to IITK. Well, for better or for worst, it did happen and I am so so glad that it did. 

I wouldn't go on to say ""yaar X year was so fun with you"" because you have been one constant in my life. I know we grow in and out of conversation but there is this unsaid understanding that everytime one of us calls the other, we pick up right where we left, with no idea of time gap whatsoever. I don't say it, but here it is, you are my comfy-bag. there are things that I know that you're the only one who'll understand. Of course that will need getting through the layer of you being an annoying kid, but totally worth it :)

Every Anataragini, every CCD hangout, every RM study session has been fun because of you. Being in absolutely different branches but being most comfortable studying with each other is something we developed before coming here and it is so amazing that we preserved it even until the end. Third year mein, you were pretty much the only person I looked forward to hang out with. Our collective love for CCD and juvenile insanity has kept us together. Be it dancing on the streets in Kolkata or jumping on the events grounds, be it throwing away my heels or throwing me away, life has always been fun around you. 

I am in complete awe of the kind of energy you possess and how you tend to dissipate it to the people around you. Problems, however big, become easier to handle after talking to you. Who cares about fucking up life when your life is at risk while cycling with you. Genuine advice -  whenever your friend falls off the cycle, it is always better to extend an arm for help rather than standing there and laughing your guts out. 

Last two months on campus, whenever I walked down that road between CCD and RM, I remembered how we would dance there at 3 AM on Beatles songs. With you, I kind of stop caring about the weird glances from public. I am sure we got many in Kolkata and so did we on campus, but whop cares, right!  I missed not being called to CCD for random paper soap supplies and being called tatti 50 times a day. I missed chasing you and falling down. I guess I just missed being that kid who stopping growing with you after 15. All of that annoyed me but also made me feel weirdly alive. Thanks for making every moment spent with you so lively. 

This is all about the paagalpanti, but you are also my RR partner. Be it courses, guys, friends or family. The level of vibe is beyond everything with you. Once in a while I wake up and I am like ooooh I miss my Doodyman and then I text/call you. It's just this plain comfortable friendship that I believe will only ripen, even when you are old and I am as hot as always. 

This is me, your Tatti, walking away doing ""I wanna hold your hand"" (you know how :)",Medha  Agarwal,True,60cf867f659165b3aa64680b,Pratham  Shukla
10,"A lot of people think that Swadha is extremely high on brains and low on approachability. While I hands down agree with the former any day, I am sad that I believed in the latter for a depressingly long time. For all those who think so, loud and clear, she is an incredibly warm and fun person!

I still can't believe that the first time I knocked on your door was in Hall-1 quarantine. But look at it this way - it took me just a couple of months to fall in love with you. Speaks a lot about your wonderful character. I will just mention it once because I know you must be already tired of hearing it - I know you're brilliant but what I appreciate more is the humility with which you carry it. Big shout-out for that.

I have been a part of the crowd that thought of you as a glorious person that you can only admire from distance. Now I think - what was I afraid of (you don't bite, right?) Should have approached you on a CCD table and told you one childhood story of mine. I know it would have been a score! XD

Jokes aside, I totally appreciate your sensibility. It's always fun to talk to you and seeing a drunk you is another level fun.  I know you're gonna do great things in life. I just hope you meet me for a coffee some time to tell me all about them in person before the world is going all gaga about them. Good luck and stay awesome!
