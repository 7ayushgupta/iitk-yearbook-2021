0,"I loved the sadistic pleasure I got from riding my cycle recklessly while you were sitting on the carrier, although, I gave you intervals to recover. Thanks for teaching me what trust truly feels like, because I doubt I trusted anyone more than you while we were roommates. Also, tujhe uthane ke liye coffee powder ka dabba in front of nose is a surefire method, tried and tested, bas patent reh gaya. 
Have a great life ahead! ",Ashwin  Girish,True,60a3b6ba819323d199d47f46,Atharv  Tyagi
1,"Heyo! Forget fluids, I remember the classes better for the gossip you brought along (The OAT beam-walker) and the music we suggested to each other (Post-Modern Jukebox is amazing!). Also, does the M-Club have a spot for alumni performances? 
That aside, I admire your authenticity and how straightforward you are. Thanks for being straightforward with your advice when I would worry unnecessarily. 
I hope you have a great career in Physics! (There's a reason why Shyamal and I called you God). Also, Death Star = SAS reunion project? The reactor will be your job.",Ashwin  Girish,True,60a3bfef819323d199d47f60,Swadha  Pandey
