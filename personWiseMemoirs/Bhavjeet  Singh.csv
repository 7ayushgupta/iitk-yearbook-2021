I don't know what I have done to offend you tbh, but whatever it is, sorry man.
Honestly, there are so many memories that we have that it's difficult to pick a handful of it, but let's give it a shot. The first story that comes to my mind is jab tu Varanasi gya tha :P. I was partly responsible for all the fuck ups that happened but I haven't accepted that till date and I still don't :P. I will always cherish our canteen moments, 'hatt behen ke lode' moments, 'uth canteen chal' moments, 'kuch bhi bol raha hai' moments, 'Kuldeep chutiya ho gya' moments and most of all, the silent slow dancing exits from each other's rooms with weird expressions on our faces. Bohot time spend kia hai on your room just sitting and discussing random gossips and ideas and it kills me that I couldn't relive that vaapis campus aa ke.
I know we haven't talked much since the start of the lockdown but trust me man, you are still a close friend and I am always there for you if you need me.",Bhavjeet  Singh,True,60c518d7659165b3aa6462a7,Abhishek  Sharma
1,"I will be honest, this is the 3rd time I am sitting to write this memoir but don't have words man. I am pretty sure if I start writing toh SnT ki chutiya website ki limit cross ho jayegi. Lets give it one more shot because we both have always been good at doing work close to the deadline.
As you know, everything I achieved at IITK mujhe hamesha meri aukaat se zyada laga hai and hence I have always been grateful for everything I got (even if in hindsight), but the thing I am most grateful to IITK for is you dude. 
'Hamara naam Anirudh hai' is how it all started. From a typical CSE maggu to a fucking all-rounder in its literal terms is how everyone sees it, I feel so privileged to know the back stories behind all the output that everyone sees. My phone gallery speaks volumes about how big a part of my life you have been for the past four years, starting from those sleeping photos in Hall CC during Takneek to those ESC101 so called night outs extending all the way to Goa pics and beyond. 
MnP managers vaali Antaragni kitni litt thi, you behaving like a kid, roaming all around the place, begging Shrey for apology hahaha. Funnily, some of the moments I have had with you are the ones jo tujhe yaad bhi nahi honge :P - Ramaiya mein Chitranshu ko galiyana, Sis guard ko galiyana, events ground ke mid mein sona and many more. 
One thing which I can't be more thankful to you for, is taking me to Debsoc. Haha, countless nights spend ki hai discussing Debsoc and its fuck ups. Voh Balluu ke room pe jo night out hua tha discussing/shouting about everything uffff. Debsoc se hi we went on multiple trips, mostly to Delhi. Now that I think of it, I got to know about half the stuff I did on campus through you.
We can literally discuss the fuck out of any topic, kitni chhoti chhoti cheezon pe puri puri raat discussions kiye hai, me trying to be logical everywhere and summing it up with a strawman in the end hehe. I remember ek baar humne Dandi kitna chaapu hai and uske future pe 1 ghanta discuss kia tha and yeh same cheez we have done for so many people. Pure campus ki gossips ek room mein pack hoti thi, the reason everyone came to our room despite the mess. Voh mattress yaad hai in the centre of our room, kitne log soye hai vahan aake, especially Babla.
We started on such divergent trajectories but it never felt that way while talking to each other and once these trajectories came together fir toh time fell short for all those discussions. RM, Chowpathi, OAT, BSBE raat ko random walks pe jaana have been the moments to cherish for me.
Ffs dude, we even planned writing a combined As We Leave.
Have a lot more to say over a full bhandi in Gurgaon, concluding it with what you said in Goa - 'Itne log roommates bante hai but sirf hum log last tak roommates rahe'.
Apologies for all the grammatical and structural flaws, another you and me thingy :P

Bc, tere bina mech kaise nikalti, mkd loddus ftw. Kitna ro ro ke nikaale hai mech ke courses, last day tak. Kitni labs, lab reports and assignments kari hai saath mein, safe to say, tera roll number mere paas hona is one of the best things that happened to me at IITK. TA201 ka project bc, kitni gaali di thi unn chutiyo ko, kya bana daala tha. Summers mein CCD vaala din kya litt tha hahaha, Stokes dive was worth fucking up the exams next morning. Tera number mere phone mein 'Call' naam se saved tha telling kitni classes mein tune uthaya hai mujhe subah.
Bohot dangerous aadmi ho bhai tum, pel dete ho saamne vaale ko, but dost badhiya ho, itni baar help ki hai chaahe assignments ho, placements ho, ya random gyaan. Itna kuch kaise pata hai bc tujhe, CoD mein hagte ho bass hehe. Ishan Sharma ke endsem se pehle vaala din kitna litt tha, pura course ek din mein hack kar dia huehue. Goa mein toh apan ne sahi mein raat di gedi maari hai, kitna drive kia tha uss din. Pure campus ke invisible memoirs leak karwa dia tune, isse bada kya proof hai dangerous hone ka.
Bohot gaali khaayi hai maine tumse huehue, most after Naishadh I think. Itna chutiya kisi ke saamne feel nahi hota jitna tere saamne hota hai. Bada startup khol ke bhulna mat saale (Goa ki baato ke baad toh darr hai mujhe iska), madad karte rehna uske badle gaali de lena chahe huehue.

Hey man, have always been a great fan of your personality, perfect blend of fun, awareness and smartness. I never felt the need to think twice before bringing up a topic in front of you is testament to what a versatile personality you are. Have always loved debating with and against you, especially those 'Mr. Speaker' moments :P. Kitna bitch kia hai with you and everyone about 'you know who'. Honestly, I haven't seen you doing fraud in anything that you picked. You handling multiple projects at the same time along with the deadly MTH courses, blew my mind at times and frankly Stanford wasn't a surprise to me.

My go to person for all the tech issues hehehe. Apan mile bhi toh aise hi the, tu mujhe iitk-sec kaise connect karte hai seekha raha tha and me noob as usual kuch samajh nahi raha tha. Kitniiii memories hai, damnnn. Every sem hum log kuch alag set of activities mein group up ho jaate the. First year mein GPLs kar rahe the, summers mein PUBG, 3rd sem mein CS201A and ESC201A, 4th mein CS applications, 5th mein intern season and RM visits, 6th mein toh pura din gup shup hi chalti thi. Lunch ke baad ke 30 mins oooffff, mera favourite time hota tha din ka, mere room pe baatein kabhi kisi topic pe toh kabhi kisi. 
First year summers mein tere room pe sone se le ke galaxy saath karne tak pura pura din saath mein bakchodi ki hai. I am glad tu hamesha meri baat maan leta tha aur mere saath UC/lib/RM/chowpati/canteen chal leta tha varna pata nahi kahan kahan akele jaata mai. 2nd year summers mein raat mein RM mein BT sharing moments stands out from the uncountable conversations we have had.
Babla ke against gang-up karna on drinking and what not is sth I am gonna miss, ab toh tum log mere pe gang-up karoge :(. 1 mahine mein bhole bhaale dipuk se ladies man, playerrr MDA kab ban gya tu dekh hi nahi paaya mai. Goa mein glimpses toh mil gye the of rise of new dipak.

Campus mein sabse zyada vibe karne vaale logo mein aate ho tum for me. Jaanta toh tumhe first year se hu, CCD mein mile the through Ojha, Phy102 mein B ke liye ro rahe the hehe. But AnC and then placements mein toh bilkul bhaii ban gye. Tumhare saath har tarah ki BT share ki and kabhi aisa nahi laga ki tum sunn nahi rahe ho dhyaan se ya samajh nahi rahe ho, itna relate toh Ojha se hi maara hu mai on campus. Almost feels like identical issues the hamare on so many topics, Capitalist saale. Bhand Naishadh is a treat to watch huehue, saari BT bahar aa jaati hai. 'Tu mujhe chutiya samajhta hai na' is the question I have been asked the most on campus, courtesy you. 
'Tu UG AnC ke liye khada ho raha hai' is all the motivation I needed to start thinking about contesting for elections. Nords pe subah 5-5 baje tak chutiyap conversations was a highlight during lockdown, itna easily thoughts convey ho jaate the uss group pe seems unreal in hindsight. 
Goa was just a start, bohot trips karenge apan log saath mein, agar tu mujhse puche bina kisi trip pe gya toh bat se pelunga. Pehle toh workation pe chalte hai kahi pahado mein.
Hahahaha, hamare CoD mein chaapne ke plans, 'ab toh professionally khelenge', kitna kuch socha tha. Classic examples of how plans get made and then fail on BB. Pubg khelte hai ab, aaaooooo.

Chahe gossip ho, courses mein fraud maarna ho, election rivalries ho xD, kaam karne ke ideas and feel ho and a lot of other stuff. No doubt, apna thought process aligned on a lot of stuff.

Every time I think of you the first thing that comes to my mind is the 4th and 5th sem that you had and I can't help but burst into laughter. You have come a long way from first year BC and maggu Rohan, it's like teri shakal pe hi likha tha ki tera double dassa aayega. From there to trying to explore some new activities on campus you became a good friend of everyone in the wing. I wish I could upload a set of photos here because believe it or not Ojha ke baad teri hi sabse zyada photos hai mere paas that too perfect to describe your journey starting from first year Antaragni where you were my sole companion to your photography plans in the wing. Kitni baar wing mein random photoshoots kiye hai, sadly meri koi acchi photo nahi hai tab ki. Apne room ke baad tere room pe I have spent the most time at IITK, kitni cheezein discuss ki hai from debating for an hour on euthanasia and fucking the hell out of Deepak's brain to some stuff that can't be mentioned here. 
You have been my partner in not eating from mess, we grew from canteen in first year to Zomato in 2nd year to UC in 3rd year. I am gonna be honest, have bitched a lot about you during 4th and 5th sem but you deserved that. Surprisingly, we have done a lot of courses together don't know how you managed to score an A everytime, bohot rr kia hai tune.

Yeh sune bohot time ho gya, 1 saal se intezaar tha ki campus jaake vahi bakchodi dobaara karenge, sigh, ab toh pata nahi kab aayega yeh mauka. Wing mein sabse pehle tere se banni shuru hui thi, sir ke chaapu hone ke charche har jagah fail gye the. First year ke itne courses ka rona kia hai tere saath, tere room pe padhai toh ho nahi paayi kabhi, bakchodi bohot kar li. First year vaale Rohan ke kitne maze liye hai apan dono ne, Ramrao ke saath kitni bakchodi ki hai, kitni gaaliyan di hai Dhruv ko aur Kuldeep ko. 
HSS Galaxy toh teri vajah se hi yaadgaar ho gya tha, kitna bol bol ke le ke gya tha tujhe mai, vahan se secy ban gye tum bhale hi fraudy, aur fir toh Hindi sahitya mein jo ghuse hai aap.
Itna farak hai hum dono mein fir bhi dosti utni hi acchi. Roz mile ya hafte mein ek baar ya chahe saal mein ek baar kyu na ho, jo memories inn 3 saalo ne de di hai, apni dosti vaisi hi rahegi hamesha. Chahe zyada baat nahi hui pichle 1 saal mein, yeh mat sochna ki mai bhul gya hu, roz baat karne ki mohtaz nahi hai apan sab wingies ki yaari, dil ka rishta hai, dimaag ka thodi.
