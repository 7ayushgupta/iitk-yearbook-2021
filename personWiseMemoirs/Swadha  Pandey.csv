0,"Last month card game sessions were some of the most fun and chill times. Thanks for constantly reminding me about the difference between critique and criticism, and glad we could struggle through PSO together. Hope you have the most amazing time ahead.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c304b9659165b3aa6461c5,Aditya  Sonthalia
1,"I am so glad we ended up in the same wing and I really got to know you. Exchanging creepy stories, random gossip sessions in the wing, and ranting about campus together was always therapeutic. Thanks for the best lap dance I have ever received, to the best possible music for a lap dance. Drenching you with water when you sat on the floor unsuspectingly is one of my favourite memories. You are an amazingly sweet and sensitive person, and somehow drunk you is even sweeter <3 I really hope we get to go on a trip super soon, because we have so many more sleepy photoshoots left to do, gossip left to discuss, and google docs left to make.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60b60100659165b3aa644f2e,Ananya  Goswami
2,"I’m wondering whether I should write you a memoir or just make weird noises to convey emotion. You’re the coolest and I already miss your amazing style of telling stories. Will always hate you for dare night, and I’m totally going to steal your first year waala green kurta one day. Thank you for supporting my morning alcoholism. Biryani, random gossip sessions, and rooftop nights are some of my fav memories from the last days of college and I need more of that on the trip. Okay, love you, see you.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a65a0a819323d199d48eb2,Anshika  Verma
3,"Whenever I came to Priya’s room, I would try to figure out whether tu blankets mein chhupi huyi hai ya nahi, you would literally disappear into them. I always admired how you stayed calm and chill and still killed it in everything you did. Also will forever worship your chipkali bhagaane ki skills.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a89ba2819323d199d4939e,Arzoo
4,"Hi physics buddy, thanks for getting me through some of the most annoying courses ever *coughs*fluids*coughs*. Wish we could’ve done more music club events together, but covid had other plans. I remember you used to be super awake and alive in all the morning classes and I’d just be sleepwalking through them all, I have to say I really admire that. Hope you have a super amazing physics career and maybe we can make an evil gravitational wave death star someday (don’t ask me how, you and Shyamal can work out the theory).",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a37532819323d199d47e98,Ashwin  Girish
5,"Avaniii yaar I have so much to say about you, you've just been the absolute sweetest person since day one. You're my OG nap partner, and first year music club bitching sessions will always be my fav. Trying to sing the aashayein harmonies and laughing our asses off on stage was one of the most fun club experiences. The best performance ever was obv Swing (love youuu). I will never stop fangirling over your part in Routine. 

I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together during the last months, with all the photoshoots, bulla sessions, and biryani making. Thanks for getting my inhaler to the rooftop, I guess I owe you my life now. Also thanks for always giving us emergency volini, odomos, and snacks.

P.S. A+A 4eva",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2ab71819323d199d47dcb,Avani  Shrivastava
6,"It sucks how long it takes to find the right friends, but I’m so glad I finally did. You are one of the most emotionally intelligent people I have ever met, and I’m amazed by how quickly you’re able to understand people and situations. The fact that you *mostly* take the pains to explain to your friends what you feel they did wrong is so admirable, and I will try to learn that. You have some sympathy in your heart even for people who have wronged you, and that takes strength man. I spent so long feeling like there weren’t too many people at IITK I could really relate to, and then when we became good friends I found myself vibing with you about almost everything. 
 
Sorry for the awkward first memory lol, but every interaction after that has been an absolute blast with you. Thanks for donating your clothes to me. Trying the orgasmic swing at Rave 3 was super fun (followed by random trip to Offline with hall 1 wing? so glad I had you for company). All the rooftop conversations (from hall 1 to hall 6) were either super chill or super intense, and I absolutely love that. From just saying hi in the lift in first year to sleeping on your floor on the last night, we’ve come a long way and my IITK journey would have been incomplete without you. Also seriously, what’s with the super immunity? Will never forgive you for not getting covid with us, but at least we had a constant two-way information exchange.
 
I’ll keep being angry with the annoying people in your life on your behalf. Too bad my sleep schedule will no longer be destroyed by gossip sessions that just couldn’t wait till the next day, but I’m sure we’ll find some arrangement. I really hope we end up in nearby places, because there is so much more we need to do, but until then regular VCs are a must and you better keep updating me with everything. Love you, see you soon pls<3",Swadha  Pandey,True,60cee60a659165b3aa64650c,Avisha
7,"“Tera ESC mein kya laga?” “Main kuchh aur soch nahi paa rahi thi poochhne ko” Kaafi funny tha, and tutorials were always so much fun with you. All the best and hope you have an amazing life.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c22888659165b3aa6459f7,Chitranshi  Singh
8,"We hung out properly only when we were being kicked out of campus, but those were some of the best days. You are the best person to party and dance with, because you never let it end. I also remember how you always had extra buckets anytime I needed them in the last four years. You’re super sweet but also crazy, and I absolutely love that xx",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a89935819323d199d49396,Deeksha  Yadav
9,"Didn’t really interact much until we were suddenly covid neighbours, glad we both made it out. Thanks for the pizza and the economics lesson, hope you have an awesome (covid-free) future!",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c31b3e659165b3aa6461f1,Dev Prakash Srivastava
10,"First of all, let me apologise for the fact that Manish Sisodia is not my dad. Dude I am also so glad we got covid together, I wouldn't have survived those 17 days otherwise. But somehow with all the movie nights, gossip sessions, and the mini-Holi, those ended up being some of the best days. Thanks for always making fun of my 'crying', and for introducing me to the best chicken tikka rice. You better visit me in the US now, and maybe we can finally watch Cast Away then (not). And always remember, *attitude for beauty*",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2b34c819323d199d47df4,Dishaa  Rajora
11,"Hosh toh sabke udte the har runthrough mein, but it was always so much fun. Couldn't have asked for better company in orientation, it was one of the most exciting performances. Thanks for introducing me to that super addictive word game you used to play, and hope you keep uploading covers. ",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c2244e659165b3aa645994,Divyansh  Tripathi
12,"I remember the first time we met, you came up to us and asked us to be in your art105 group because tere group mein ‘ladkiyaan nahi hain.’ I will always make fun of you for that. Bro I am so glad we got to hangout in VH, because tujhe torture karke hi toh quarantine nikla hum sabka. Also, a kettle is not a dishwasher, and voyeurism is illegal. Chal abb US mein milte hain, you’re an amazing human and I’m glad I got to know you.
P.S. Faizan kuchh gossip bata na",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a377f4819323d199d47e9c,Faizan  Siddiqui
13,"Brooo, you already know how hard this memoir is for me to write, there are just too many memories. I remember first year mein you were Avani’s loud roommate and would wake up the whole wing when you were around. And then I got to know the real you, and it has been a total blast.
 
You always made everyone’s birthdays so special, and were so excited for yours, it was the cutest thing. I know you’re the ultimate food stealer, but to me you will always be the person who cheered me up with a muffin or a munch or just any of those cute gifts that would make my day. The day we kicked out profs ke bachche from the trampoline will always be super special to me. Whenever I was bored I’d just pop into your room and 3 ghante mast time pass ho jaata tha, it’s so weird not being able to do that anymore. Saturday, Terazza, Covid times, VH, your flute practise in the mornings, late night gossip sessions, CCD between classes, Antaragni birthdays, making fun of my handwriting (which is not that bad), aaj mess mein kya hai, canteen chalna hai kya, okay I’m emo now.
 
From “Yaar iss sem se cpi badhaani hai” to “mera Google mein ho gaya,” you have achieved so much and it has been so inspiring to watch. I hope you get all the happiness (and $$$) in the world because you deserve it. Stay SAFE, okay bye.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60b5eebc659165b3aa644f2c,Gunjan  Jalori
14,"Thanks for becoming my friend when my only dog friend died :’) I will always be jealous of your super candid photos. Glad we got to hangout, and hope you have an amazing time ahead.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c22b14659165b3aa645a2e,Jatin  Rathaur
15,"I knew it, what a best friend thief. But I’ve seen you be such a good friend to everyone, so who better to steal her. I’ve never had anyone text randomly just to say they felt they were wrong about something, and honestly, I respect that so much and hope to be more like that. RM nightout was a lot of fun and I wish we could’ve hung out more, but abb toh I’ll crash at your place only when I visit SF/Stanford. You’re a super chill guy and always interesting to talk to, and I’m sure you’ll keep killing it in life. Oh and thanks for suggesting Manchester Orchestra and later being surprised that I’d heard of it.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60cf57ec659165b3aa646620,Kushagra  Gupta
16,"Hi co-coordi, thanks for making the club and our tenure super fun, tere bina club nahi chalta for sure. Too bad we never got a proper last performance but year end treat ke paise toh bache. Here's to your infinite song suggestions from first year, may they rest in peace.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a36fb5819323d199d47e90,Mayant  Mukul
17,"Medhaaa, I have always been in awe of how many things you excelled at, you’re so insanely talented. Your stories always made me laugh so hard, I need more late night gossip sessions yaar. Teri yaad mein none of us could make coffee for the last two days after you left. I would apologise for drenching you with water jiss din humein college se nikaala gaya, but we all know you deserved it. I remember our conversation around application time about how we would get rejected from everywhere, but abb toh seedha Seattle mein coffee pilaayegi tu. Please keep posting reels till then, okay see you soon.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a66230819323d199d48f4d,Medha  Agarwal
18,"Hi ex-roommate, thanks for helping make B609 a home. We didn’t get to hangout as much after first year, but you were one of the first friends I made at IITK and one of the sweetest people. Voh initial months ki bonding humesha rahegi, and I genuinely hope you have an amazing future.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c22e04659165b3aa645a72,Nalli  Bhavita
19,"Thanks for going through 690 together, that course was one confusing ride. Hope you have a great future, and we collab over some crazy quantum shit sometime.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c2265f659165b3aa6459c5,Neelesh Kumar Vij
20,"You will always be a legend to me because of *that* dance move and *that* story about something happening in 2 seconds. I know we only got to hangout properly towards the end but I’m so glad we did, you’re amazing and gorgeous and a genius makeup artist. The last campus night with the ouija board in your room is one of my fav IITK memories. (Also how was your room always so pretty?) Okay abb wing trip pe chalte hain. ",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a37f28819323d199d47eae,Nupur  Mehra
21,"""Chhoo mat mujhe"" -You to me for the last 4 years. I'm so glad you joined the club, and galaxy was always just the most fun with you. Whatever the position, I just loved the hangouts and the planning and us trying to make a band with no synth players. You're so super talented, please never stop making music. ",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a2b5d7819323d199d47dfb,Pragya  Patel
22,"Writing a memoir for you would basically mean a recap of my time at IITK, but I’ll try. I’m pretty sure I would’ve fallen into some ditch four years ago and never been found again if it wasn’t for you. Thanks for always rescuing me from the stupid stuff I did. But seriously, please learn how to walk and stop running into me ffs. 
 
I’m sure we’re going to get some old people disease together in 50 years because our record is pretty solid at this point. All the music club shit is totally worth it because I got to meet you, and I got to meet you right at the beginning. You’re the most amazing friend anyone could have, and you’ve made me feel so supported and never judged. Thanks for always having my back and you know I’ll always have yours. And like you said, you know too much so at this point you have to stick with me or duel to the death.
 
From hiding under the music club table and playing dumb games to sitting in the VH reception and watching Tarak Mehta, we’ve done some super dumb shit but we’d always do it together and it felt perfectly normal. You’re the most overdramatic person ever, and I absolutely love it. It’s never “I dislike this person,” it’s always “Isko chhat se phenknaa hai” and that is 100% the attitude I need in life. Remember the first Antaragni when we tried so many ice creams at that one stall that the shop bhaiyya remembered me for the next four years? Too bad about our failed Chegg plans, we had solid motivation for about 10 minutes. I would pop into your room basically all the time, but it wasn’t for your lame company, it was for cooler ki hawaa. Driving away chipkalis from our corner of the wing was super traumatic and you were always useless but Ily. The covid days when we’d sneak into each other’s rooms and have fancy apple juice and watch movies almost became a vacation, also “aur kiske baare mein gossip kar sakte hain.”
 
This is not a goodbye message, because I’ll be visiting you all the time and then two years from now when you get a job and become super rich you better start visiting me (and funding me k thx). You mean the world to me, and I will always love you so so much. We’ve come a long way in these last four years and I’m so proud of the absolute boss you’ve become. Nothing I say here will be enough. You are never ever getting rid of me.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60ced7c7659165b3aa6464f6,Priya  Mishra
23,"B609, B202<3 The fact that we passed first sem PE will always be a miracle. Thank you for dealing with my late night sleepwalking(?) and all my weird habits, and for being my partner in avoiding the HEC har event mein fraud maarne ke liye. I remember tu har music club event mein aati thi just for my performance, mujhe support karne, and I just want to say that I appreciated that so so much, thank you yaar :’) I miss our random gossip sessions, your mom’s chocolate barfi, your emotional breakdowns every time there was a chipkali in the room, your mirror dance sessions, us running for TA lectures and eating homeopathy medicine as breakfast, and a million other memories that will stay with me forever. Oh and, #iamfashion

25,"It was always great talking to you, and the annoying literature project would have been impossible to do without you (and without bitching about it together).

26,"From first year PE to eng bitching sessions to fourth year quarantine, I'm glad I got to do them with you because you made it all infinitely more fun. I remember your first year phase when you just waved to people on Messenger, and that was our whole conversation (one of the most meaningful conversations I’ve ever had, I have to say). You're an absolute boss and I know you’re going to kill it in life, hope we meet again sometime soon xx",Swadha  Pandey,True,60a372f4819323d199d47e95,Thanya  B
27,"Thanks for that amazing email introducing us to the art105 group, it will never stop being funny. Have to say I liked the other Vatsalya more but it was super fun hanging out with you as well. Hope your obsession with Office never dies, and I’m sure you’ll have a great life.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c229fc659165b3aa645a1a,Vatsalya  Tandon
28,"Book club duty was always fun when I got to hear your startup plans, hope you get to follow through with them. Didn’t really get to hangout much after that until the last days, but you were super chill to talk to and I’m still jealous of that Harry Potter t-shirt.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c22c97659165b3aa645a53,Yash  Baheti
29,"We didn't get to hangout much but whenever we interacted, you were always the sweetest. Just thought you should know how much I admire your dance skills, I'm possibly your biggest fan. Hope you have a great future, I'm sure you'll kill it.",Swadha  Pandey,True,60c2257d659165b3aa6459af,Yashika
