Tera wala memoir likhna hi sabse easy and sabse hard hai at the same time.
Ekdum shuru se kaafi bakchodi ki apan se saath me - CFD, woh CS203 wala extra assignment, successful ICPC, failed ICPC XD. Mai kabhi nahi samajh paaya how you could be so invested and productive in the shit you do, and I think I never will - woh ek aisi chiz hai jisko dur se dekhke admire hi kar sakta mai!
And tere goals sunke hamesha maza aata tha! But aakhri me, you aced it, as always. Keep giving me more reasons to be surprised <3",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c1c171659165b3aa645503,Abhyuday  Pandey

Cute aadmi! 
Bc aakhri tak 'tu' bolna nahi sikha ... yeh possible bhi kaise hai? 
Anyways, kya mast nature hai be tera! Hamesha khush rehta hai ans khush kar deta hai <3
Tune college life me colors laa diye, and ab Guggal me logo ko entertain karna!!

4,"Sanghi,
Shuru se hi, I was surprised by how sure you are with everything you do - and it has been very very inspiring. Didn't quite get used to understanding tu kya bolta tha, because tere bolne ki speed meri samajhne ki speed se jyada hai XD. I love how you could always juggle fun and work, and I admire you for it!
Yaad rakhna, and phir milenge :)",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c1bfde659165b3aa6454fb,Aniket  Sanghi
5,"Time spent chatting with you during NYO and ABS was real fun. I'd be excited to see what you pull off in the upcoming years :)
PS - Mere paas wo holey hollow sphere abhi bhi hai - the one you were interested in. And I'm not so sure what to do with it :/",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,6098be93819323d199d478b7,Anish  Saxena

7,"Yo Ayush!!
It was mad fun learning violin with you (and the lack of peers kinda explains why I could not continue later :/ )
Yep, you do get a lot of credit for getting me hooked onto Brandon, and I love you for it! Which makes it all the more sucky ki maybe I could have had a lot of fun discussions with you.
Anywhoos, tata!",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c224df659165b3aa6459a1,Ayush  Agarwal

CFD, do ICPC, infinite assignments, and all imaginary parties - you've been an amazing friend through it all. Thanks for making my life at IITK better.

10,"Geetam bro <3
Apart from woh wing wala Harlem shake, meri tere saath pehli iinteresting memory kisii jhagde ki hai. And ladte ladte tune beech me bola tha, ""Bhai 'intimate' nahi 'intimidate' hota hai. English to theek kar le!"" Ab kyaa hasi  aati woh sochte time!
But yes, sabse best bakchodi to aakhri ke 1 month me hi ki. Best quarantine buddy Ii could have hoped for! Wing ka football, cricket, late night bhatakna, and saari treats - ekdum unforgettable bana diya bro tune campus life ka end.
Apple needs you, and I'm sooo happy for you <3",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c22961659165b3aa645a0c,Geetam
11,"Harshu, mere bhai <3
Without a doubt, tere saath sabse jyada bakchodi ki hai maine pure IITK me!

What started off as 'CS202 me team up karega?' became what I am sure is lifelong friendship. For the longest time, tu mere liye woh 'go-to' person raha hai. Be it padhai, or treat, or just about anything, you'd be the first jo dimaag me aata tha, and hai.

Hab bhi jarurat ho, upar uthaane ke liye tu hamesha mere saath raha hai (so much so ki 252 me 'independently' kaam karke bhi same app bana diya tha :p). Tere saath baat karte time I don't feel the need to use a filter, kyuki pata hai tu meko samajh hi jaega.

And of course, teri maarne ka to alag hi maza hai - gande jokes, kharab angrezi, lack of sarcasm. Kabhi kabhi lagta ekdum innocent hai bc.

Teko thoda bhi idea nahi hai how much you matter to me. Bas ek hi request hai ab - reunions organize karwaate reh, you are the glue of our group. I am proud to call you bhai.",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60a62e2e819323d199d48ba0,Harsh  Agarwal

Keep in touch!",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,6098c3f1819323d199d478bf,Kanishka
14,"Bhai, 
kaafi samay tak teri image mere mann me 'introverted padhaku' wali thi - jo unconditionally help kar dega anytime I ask. Of course, 5th sem waale antics and trauma to hamesha yaad rahenge, especially vfork. And as much as we bonded over nakli hackathons, assignments, and computer sciency discussions, something felt ... distant.
Mai kaafi baar Snehal ko pucha, ""How do I get him to open up?"" 
And eventually, I found it - books and Harry Potter <3
What followed were many many heartwarming nerdy discussions that are super special because very few can appreciate how awesome they are. The only thing I regret is not being able to have these discussions in person.
Yeh bolne ka jarurat nahi how intelligent and hardworking you are. But one thing I love about you is your humility. Thank you for being in my 'inner circle.' Thank you for always pushing me to do better and be better. And thank you for changing my life.",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60a627c8819323d199d48b4a,Keshav  Bansal

16,"KG!
Dhundhne par bhi tere jaisa mast roomie nahi mil sakta tha. Do saal tak tune mere jaise roommate ko jhela, uske liye mai bata nahi sakta kitni respect karta mai teri!

Haan, ek galti to ki maine - jitni bakchodi tere saath aakhri 1-2 mahine me ki, utni pure samay ki hoti to college life ka alag level pe maza aata. Ritesh ke room ke bahar fataka phodna, Aditya ke room pe baithke woh GoT ka episode dekhna, and teri ghar pe baat karne waali awaaz - yeh bhool hi nahi sakte!

And last sem me jo kuch kiya woh to hai hi. Pure campus me photography, tere and Shailabh ke arguments ka double meaning nikaalna, treats, games, etc etc - tune hi asli college life dikhayi hai bro. Isliye tu hamesha special rahega ❤️",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60a63225819323d199d48bd9,Kushagra Gupta (R Gupta)

I'm so happy ki you are my friend! Pehle woh sasta aeroplane, phir NSS waale amazing classes - it was a joy to work with you! Itna sweet, humble, and cool aadmi hai yaar tu - I wish aur jyada time milta tere saath bakchodi karne ka!
Until next time! <3

20,"Shivam bhai,
4 years me teko bahut badalte hue dekha, and I couldn't be prouder. Kaha wo banda jiske muh se awaz hi nahi nikalti thi, and kaha wo jo pure LHC ke kaan faad deta XD
Mast maza kiya be apan ne saath me - Antaragni me ghoomna, treats, assignments (of course). Jab bhi mai bored ya thaka hua rehta tha, mai tere and Aditya ke room pe aa jaata, knowing ki tum log meko cheer up kar hi doge, and you never failed to :)
Deadlines ka and tera rishta thoda bura hai, yeh to maanna padega! But tu hamesha pull off kar leta, and aage bhi kar hi lega - I am sure. <3",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c1be72659165b3aa6454ee,Shivam Kumar (B P Singh)

22,"Bro!
You are how I imagined every person at IITK would be like - super ambitious, can somehow manage a million things at a time, and tries too hard to make unfunny jokes!
From deeply philosophical discussion in your room to violin class to interviews (shh!), you have been an awesome friend through it all.
I'm sooo excited to see what you build next, and will be rooting for you <3",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c223e3659165b3aa64598a,Yash  Baheti
23,"Bajpai,
Abhi ye memoir likhne  baitha to itni saari choti choti images dimaag me aa rahi! Pehle se hi apan lectures saath me karte the, and then woh singing competition wala stint (jaha pata chala tha ki tu gaa bhi leta hai!). And then kaafi impromptu visits!
Agar meko koi puche ki IITK me kisne apni sabse jyada marwaake kaam kiya, to tera hi naam aaega. But yes, you have always pulled thru, and big things wait for you <3",Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal,True,60c22e6f659165b3aa645a7b,Yasharth  Bajpai
