We share countless memories, trips to Z Square, Hidden Lounge, Goa, clubs, and post club car :p, all of them will be stay in my memory forever, just like our group sketch in my room 😍. Had loads of fun and made memories of a lifetime in Goa with you brother 😅😊 . That night was certainly one of the most memorable memory in our lives. Last month mein jo bakchodi was cherry on top, none of which would be possible without you. Here's to creating many such memories in the future🍻 All the best bhai ❤️

1,"Ananta bhai... One the most sorted, high-spirited person I've met on campus. Your approach towards life will take you places. Stay the same.

From wingi to my partner in crime, we have shared lots of golden memories together... Odyssey ke dance🕺  aur OAT ki movie night  🎥   se lekar... Friday night ki mehfil 🍻 , after-party devastation aur Terrace par bakchodi tak .. hamne sath mein bohot masti ki 😌 ... we explored all kinds of unorthodox stuff  together pushing each other for that last puff.. saying ""bro mein tujhe sambhal lunga"" 😂.

It was a great journey bro... hope to meet you soon for the next party and all the very best for your life ahead. Stay connected! ",Nimish  Agarwal,True,60a16aad819323d199d47c7f,Ananta  Mukherjee
2,"Yo Anchal... meri civil buddy. 
Mast bandi hai tu yaar... kind hearted and honest. Stay same! 😊
We met properly during Techkriti par uske baad hamne sath me team treats aur pre-fest parties mein bohot masti ki. The Mill ke bahar hamara bhand photo-shoot aur Holi celebration hamesha yaad rahega. 
Late night tech-summit discussions se lekar C-bot mein ki masti tak, fest cancel hone ki BT se lekar OAT ki final walk tak.. you were a great company. 🤗
I hope to meet you soon (preferably in the campus) and I'll be always just a call away for your any kind of help. All the very best for your future, stay connected! :)

3,"Yo Ashish bro!
You are among the most hilarious, enthusiastic, and dashing persons I know at IITK.
Your artistic skills are out of this world man!
It's been amazing being your friend for which no words suffice. As a roommate, you were more than helpful, and a great company for hanging out. From GBM sessions in the fresher year to watching the cricket world cup on projector with wingies, we have a lot of fun experiences. 
I wish you a very happy life ahead and may our friendship and memories live forever. 
We'll definitely stay in touch. Milte hai jaldi for that next Himachal trip.
Love you, bro! ❤️",Nimish  Agarwal,False,60cf8e75659165b3aa64689e,Ashish  Dhiman
4,"Yo Monika! The girl with a great smile. 
We met for SIH (the only good thing happened in that hackathon 😅) and it was great working with you. I will always remember our first meeting and my reaction to my friend. 
Uske baad campus mein milne ka mauka nhi mila warna we would have shared a lot more memories. 
I hope to meet you soon for the long awaited SIH treat and probably a trip to enjoy nature. :)
Till then, you keep on flexing those cool yoga poses and keep smiling like that :)
All the very best for your future, stay connected! ",Nimish  Agarwal,True,60a17dbf819323d199d47c8e,Monika  Rathore

Tune apan dono ki memories itne ache se pen down ki hai, ki don't mind if I copy some stuff (which is casual being a civil brother :p) 
I can't think of even one deed in Civil in which we weren't teammates! Group projects mai humne kamaal ke stuff banae bhai,  I still remember first year ke apne NYO wale days, woh apna saath mai 8 hours ka backlog pura karna. 
ART mai mera, Aman aur tera saath mai gaane sunte hue night-out maar ke collage banana, PPT mein stage par to G* hi fat rhi thi bhai and despite  my lowest marks amongst us, apan sabka A lagna 😂  
TA202 mai apna Babu ke saamne fraud marna and phir bhi best project award jeetna 😁  
Woh cement and GI ki boring labs ko saath mai funny bnana, tumlogo ke sath ki wajah se mere civil ke courses enjoyingly nikal gaye bhai _/\_
Aur ML ka paper publish hona to literally cherry on top tha bhai, alag hi motivation tha uss semester paper chaapne ka aur startup jesa pitch karne ka. Itna well-structured kaam hamne shayad hi kabhi kiya hoga. 
Yeh 4 saal saath mai ki bakchodiyan humseha yaad rahengi bro. Ab HiLabs mai jakar to atleast high ho jana bhai, Aur crypto ki losses to sath hi cover honge bhai.

7,"Yo Avani... one of the most frank and joyful person I met on campus. 
Likhne ke liye bohot saari cheeze hai par time crunch ki wajah se major highlights likh deta hun baki abhi bohot parties karni hai sath mein :)
We share good memories of team parties and holi events. Late night tech-summit discussions se lekar C-bot mein ki masti tak, fest cancel hone ki BT se lekar OAT ki final walk tak.. you were a great company. Agli baar sath mein shiv darshan par chalte hai :p
I hope to meet you soon and will be always just a call away for your any kind of help. All the very best for your future, stay connected! :)",Nimish  Agarwal,True,60c236c5659165b3aa645b78,Avani  Shrivastava

Meri zindagi mein teri ek khas jagah hai. Techkriti mein pehli baar trip dilane se lekar Shiv darshan karane tak, shukriya! 
Goa mein bhi tune maze dila hi diye :p Aap jese ""pro"" logo ke sath rehkar hamesha accha lagta hai. _/\_
Apart from that, huge respect for the hard work and the dedication you put in any work that you take !!
Fest hota to alag hi maze aate par still I feel ki Techkriti team ke saath judna was one of the best decision I took in my College life.
All the very bhai for your future bhai, Milte hai jald hi agli trip ke liye! :)",Nimish  Agarwal,True,60c24203659165b3aa645cf0,Devendra Kumar Meel

College life mein agar BHAI shabd ka asli matlab bataya jayega to hamara zikr zaroor hoga. ❤️ 
1st year ke pehle din se lekar.. college life ke akhri din tak, hum hamesha sath rhe hai. Fir chahe hamari wing change ho jaye ya kuch bhi ho, hamari bonding kabhi nhi tooti. 
C610 se lekar B208 tak hamne anginat memories banai hai... 
Tere liye HEC ka poster design karne se lekar.. profs ko alag alag type ke mails draft karne tak, bahut bakchodi ki. (Wo campaigning mein seniors dwara gaand marna hamesha yaad rahega) 😂
The Mill mein party karna, aur tera ghoomer dance. 
B208 mein summer se lekar 3rd year tak Mini Militia mein Naksalwadi ki maarna (😜) aur projector par movies dekhne se lekar har tarah ki bakchodi karna. 
Courses mein assignments/quizzes aur exams tak mein content ki adla badli karna.. 😂
Har samay sath bethkar cheeze planout karna aur bakchodi pelna... 
Tere logo se gussa hone par tujhe shant karana aur tere drams event mein puri wing ko kheech kar lekar aana. 
Mujhe 4 saal nashte ke liye subha uthane ke liye thank you bhai.
Harshit se sath milkar maze lene mein bahut maza aata tha yrr. Aur last mein lavesh ki faadna was ultimate! 😂
Subah Terrace par ghumna aur tujhe maal ke liye motivate karna. 
Teri Didi ki shaadi was ultimate fun! 
Na jane ese kitne aur kisse hai bhai sath mein.. aur aage bhi bante rahenge!
All the best for future kahu ya nhi samajh nhi aa rha kyonki tere almost har decision me to mein hamesha sath hi hota hun 😂. Milte hai jald hi bhai aur trip par chalte hai. Maze karo!

Mein baki logo ke sath milkar teri maarta hun bhai par deep inside hamesha respect hai bro! Tera dedication towards acads and goals inspiring hai bhai.
Inspite of you being so timid and mainstream, mene tujhe kaafi cheezon ke liye inspire kar hi diya aur akhri dino mein 43.2% wali neat ""cold-drink"" pilayi hi di. :) (Ab iss exploration ko continue rakhiyo).
Age bhi agar useful advices chahiye to parties deta rahiyo. Aur cypto ki recovery to bhul jao bhai, assume it as my cut in the savings on your new laptop. :p
