Hats off to your hard work and dedication bhai. You have always inspired me to push my limits. Your undying attitude, motivation for learning, absorbing capacity and thinking skills have always made me feel the unlimited potential in you. Hamari mulakat Robocon ke recruitment ke baad hi hui thi, Vivek ke through shayad. Initially shayad tu thoda inconfident tha, shayad baaki log sahi se nhi samjhte the but tujhse baat karke humesha ek dediccation wali feel aayi hai. Apne designs ko lekar, processes ko lekar, manufacturing methods ko lekar itne discussions hue hai ki mujhe kaafi seekhne ko mila hai. Tu hamesha question karta tha and cheezo ko sahi krne ki koshish krta tha. Tere inputs and efforts ke bina MR1 would never have existed. Last me jab MR1 me mere saath tu tha tab hamesha I felt supported. I knew ki mujhse jyada tu dekh rha hai sab, tujhe fikar hai cheezo ki. Kaafi kuchh seekha hai bhai tumhare saath kaam karke. Robocon ke baad kaafi confidence aaya hai mujhme bhi. Mujhe apna LHC Foyer me discussion yaad hai, intern ke time. Mujhe pata tha ki tu chaapega hi, kyunki kuchh bhi challenge ho, You never give up. Keep this determination towards your goals intact. You’ll reach much greater heights. Aur ab bade aadmi ho gye ho bhai, toh hume mat bhul jaana. Yaad kar liya kro kabhi kabhi. Fir zarur milenge bhai ME, Y17 ke reunion pe.",Suyash  Singh,True,60a598cb819323d199d4872f,Aman  Gautam
1,"Anuj bhai, kabhi bhi le le party! aur jitni meri pending hai, utni teri bhi hai xD
Mene tujhse jyada chill banda nhi dekha bhai campus me. Your face in my memory is fixated with that smile of yours, and will remain so. Hamesha haste rehna bhai aise hi aur hasate rehna! 
First time tujhe aur Raghav ko Sunit ke room pe ladte hi dekha tha xD. Idk kaise tumne jhela hai mujhe aur Sunit ko 1st year me. Fir, the NYO intern. Kaafi achhe movie recommendations diye hai tune (The Prestige is one that I distinctly remember). Antaragni ke app ki saari beta testing to tumne hi ki hai bhai xD - wahan bhi kaafi sahi suggestions as always. Toh one thing I know for sure is, ki kabhi koi suggestion lena hua, then I know the guy to call (lol). 
Chaapa to har jagah hai hi tune, aise hi chapte reh bro! Fir milenge bhai kabhi treat dene lene ke liye xD.",Suyash  Singh,True,60a58bbd819323d199d48700,Anuj Mayurkumar Shah
2,"""A guy who dropped obsession to know the importance of life, happiness and relationships."" - Can a bio get more apt! I still remember seeing the passion to build a team and taking it to heights in your eyes the day we sat together in Hall 2 Common Room. If there is one team of all I know, which can make a Quadruped move in a span of 2 hrs with a defective Maxon motor and a faulty circuit, it's that Robocon team. And it didn't come together, I was made - by us! Couldn't have imagined pulling off an inch of what we did in Robocon, had you not been there. I guess, janta toh me pehle hi tha ki Saini is the most passionate guy when it comes to Robotics, dekh bhi liya un 8-9 mahino me. Starting off from scratch is never easy. Never imagined ki ek team bana denge 10 din me jiske liye 550+ recruitment applications aa jayengi and SnT code me 1 question bhi ban jayega (ab reveal kar sakte hai na? xD). Wo SnT code wali raat bhai, kitne maze kiye the.. and uske baad, the entire Robocon journey. 2.5 saal ki campus life me 1 saal to MR1 MR2 hi banate rahe xD. But it has been one of the most centerpiece learnings of my campus life, and all credits to you! Wo saare birthday celebrations yaad hai, saari meetings me backchodi yaad hai, saare serious discussions bhi yaad hai xD
You are a truly special person. Bohot kind, caring and courageous. Tujhse hi kaafi confidence mila hai kaafi cheeze karne ka. Thank you “Saini”, for making me believe that a bunch of inexperienced guys can actually create an autonomous bot and a quadruped from a nominal budget and in an unrealistic time frame. Ever grateful for everything. You have a brave heart and I know, you’ll do great in life ahead and forever! Aur Robocon ke reunion pe milte hai fir xD

3,"The most down to earth, humble, multi talented and caption creative guy I've met on campus, Divyansh Sir! _/\_
Kanpur ke logo me alag hi feel hoti hai, bade pyare hote hai. Aap bhi Kanpur ke hai, hum bhi paas hi ke hai :p, alag hi connect hai bas.
NYO me hi mile the shayad sabse pehle. Pro-coder toh aap pehle se hi rhe hai, fir Dept me mulakat hui. Aur fir baad me Robocon. Wo nightouts bakhubi yaad hai. Wo Cricket match bhi yaad hai, uske baad kiya Hall 13 ka breakfast bhi. Kaafi achha time tha, jitna kaam kiya tha saath me utni yaade bhi hai. Itna explore karne ka patience toh sabke paas nhi hota, but hum saath me NYO se Robocon se Mech tak explore hi kr rhe the xD. Ek never settle wala attitude seekha hai aapse. Aise hi usse banaye rakhiyega.. Kyunki aage bhi chaapna hi hai aapko! Jab bhi mile hai, “aur bhai?” barkarar rakha hai, ab milenge fir se “aur bhai!” barkarar rakhne ke liye. All the best bhai. Keep doing great stuff.

5,"Yo Maitreyee!
You’re a pure-hearted, chaotic and yet at peace person (idk how!). Congratulations on having done all possible bakchodi on campus. Was nice to stick to the phone for 6 hrs straight and discuss random stuff altogether. Campus se jaate jaate ek accha kaam kar liya, wo call attend krne ka xD Kaafi nostalgia tha uss time, and uss nostalgia me tum bhi ho ab :p. Thank you for the dailing the right (wrong? No, right!) number. :D
Keep that fun loving part of yours intact, kyunki backchodi nhi rukni chahiye xD. Be calm as you are and keep working hard as you do. You're gonna achieve much greater heights. All the best for everything to come. Cheers!

6,"Nimish bhai.. sabse humble & happy, chill & chaapu!
Jab bhi mile hai, ""aur bhai? bas bhai!"" toh kar hi liya hai humne apna xD. Ye Bro code toh intact hi rahega. Mulakat toh 1st year me hi ho gyi thi, jab me Sunit ke room pe TA ke assignments karne aata tha xD. Thakkar Sir ke room me pro-coding krte hi dekha hai saath me tujhe. Bohot hard work kiya hai bhai tune.. have been with you through the NYO intern. Apni Lucknow wali trip yaad hai xD - MLH Hackathon ke liye gaye (Lol!). Bhai, bohot maze kiye hai, will never forget that Lucknow visit - Aisa random plan and fir chutiya katana yaad rahega.. abhi bhi soch ke hasi nhi ruk rhi. Aise hi cool and classic rehna bhai. All the best aage ke liye.. aur fir kabhi kisi Hackathon me chutiya katane chalenge saath me :D",Suyash  Singh,True,60a58ec8819323d199d4870c,Nimish  Agarwal
7,"Yo Priank,
Kyun hai itna khush tu? Everytime I have seen you, it's been with a wide smile on your face. ""Aur bhai, kaisa hai?"" has been and will be our bro-code xD
Kahan kahan nhi machaya hai tune and yet, itna down to earth rehta hai. Backchodi is your premier league, will always be. Ye Aero wale sab itne litt log mile hai. Ek wo chhotu hai, Yash Raj, ek wo motu hai, Aviral xD.. Ek tu hai jo sober bhi, high lagta hai. Remain this way, backchod, friendly and khush (bina wajah). Your passion for robotics is inspiring, man. Tera publication bhi dekha tha and it tells the efforts you have put in. Be it taking AUV to greater heights or be it getting high yourself xD, you’ve done a great job altogether (No, seriously! :D).
Aise hi chapte reh bhai.. All the best for everything to come. Cheers!

9,"Tere liye kya memoir likhna hai bhai. Apna safar to iss IITK ki journey se kaafi pehle se shuru ho gya tha, and kaafi baad tak milte hi rahenge for sure. But theek hai, aaj tak aise mauka nhi mila kyunki hum dono hi kaafi cool kism ke log hai xD Jay jitni emotional baate nhi likhni aati par haan, tum ho toh bilkul alag personality. 11th me toh darr lagta tha bhai, isaan hai ya bhagwan. Sab pata rehta hai, sab padha hua hai.. Lagta tha wapas JEE de rha hai humare saath, ek do baar nikal hi rakha hoga pehle xD Wese mujhse jyada darr BNM Sir ko lagta tha tbh (haha, lol).
Anyway, wo bhi “badiya” din the, kyunki tumhare saath sab badiya hi hota hai. JEE ki prep time ki best memories tere saath hi hai kyunki tu hi itna serious tha poore batch me xD. Tests ke baad paper discuss krna toh 11th se hi hai. Pehle sirf meri faadta tha, baad me poore wing ki (specially, buchas fuffa) xD
Last paper ke baad CP ke samne khade hoke “All the Best” bola tha jab, tab laga tha shayad last time mil rhe hai.. but kya coincidence tha bhai! Same IIT, Same Hall, Same Wing. “Hum Alwar se aaye hai!” will remain our tagline. College me bhi nhi sudhre tum (actually, bigde). Abhi tak wahi Sabhay ho jo sabse jyada magta hai, sabke doubts solve krta hai (CP se hi hai ye to), sab padha sakta hai before exams (kuchh ECO wale log toh isi bharose pass ho rhe hai EE ke courses me xD). But bhai, tera dedication _/\_, mene toh kaafi pehle chhod diya tha but you took this to another level. No doubt you deserve to be at the Top in whatever you do ahead. Your hard work shows, in whatever you have achieved. Kaafi inspire kiya hai bhai itne saal. Tum kar rhe the itni mehnat shayad isiliye sabne kr li thodi bohot jitni ki hai. Robocon ka MPID algorithm toh alag level tha xD xD. Tujhse jyada cool, calm and courageous banda nhi dekha bhai. Kaafi pessimistic hai bas, kabhi toh achha soch liya kar. EE360 me tere hisaab se fail hi ho rhe the hum log at one point. Glad to have travelled this journey with you and literally bhi IITK tak ka safar (Train wala bhi aur life wala bhi) hamesha tumhare saath hi rha hi aur aage bhi rahega (Train wala bhi, Train-Bus-Air wala bhi - Alwar to Aurangabad ka algo figure out kr lena bas). Theek hai, agar yahan tak tumne padha hai (which I doubt,.. beech me chala gya hoga PMI ka project krne), to ye bhi sun lo sehat ka dhyaan rakho aur jeevan me ab thodi aish krlo (#taalis lakh ka sahi upyog krne ke liye tau ko sampark kare, investment se expenditure ki saari maths bata denge). Theek hai bhai, “badiya!”.
