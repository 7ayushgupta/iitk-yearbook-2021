Mujhe ITC ka internship recruitment wala din to hamesha yaad rahega xD, specially tera HR interview aur wo same 2 questions jo baad me tujhse puchhe the!

Kitna machana hai be! xD On a serious note, kaafi time spent kiya hai bhai tere saath lab me, bohot kuchh seekha bhi hai, treats bhi ki hai saath me, pehle whiskey shot bhi tere saath hi liya tha lol :p. Wo EHE ke experiments kaafi boring the but perseverance seekha hai lab me tere saath kaam karke. Your undying spirit to find solutions is surreal bhai, hands down. Yaad hai mujhe, tu bc puri H E Merritt padhke aa gya tha ek din me, leakage wali non-linearity ka model develop krne ke liye. Bhai mech me toh chaapa hi hai ultimate, ab EE me bhi phod. It was a delight working in the lab alongside you. Delhi trip hamesha yaad rahegi bhai! Itna fun free me xD Lockdown ho gya aur tu campus nhi aa paya. Apna last bye aur last lab treat reh gyi. But chill, Madlab will remain a platform for us to meet up sometime soon. Govind ki Thesis ki party bhi leni humko alag se.

Fir toh jab bhi mile hai, baat hui hai, aur kabhi aapke chehre se hasi nhi hati. Sabki life me problems aati hai, tera intern wala time tough tha but fir hamesha comeback karna is what matters the most. Tere placement ke time pe dil se bohot khushi hui thi bhai.

Hats off to your hard work and dedication bhai. You have always inspired me to push my limits. Your undying attitude, motivation for learning, absorbing capacity and thinking skills have always made me feel the unlimited potential in you. Hamari mulakat Robocon ke recruitment ke baad hi hui thi, Vivek ke through shayad. Initially shayad tu thoda inconfident tha, shayad baaki log sahi se nhi samjhte the but tujhse baat karke humesha ek dediccation wali feel aayi hai. Apne designs ko lekar, processes ko lekar, manufacturing methods ko lekar itne discussions hue hai ki mujhe kaafi seekhne ko mila hai. Tu hamesha question karta tha and cheezo ko sahi krne ki koshish krta tha. Tere inputs and efforts ke bina MR1 would never have existed. Last me jab MR1 me mere saath tu tha tab hamesha I felt supported. I knew ki mujhse jyada tu dekh rha hai sab, tujhe fikar hai cheezo ki. Kaafi kuchh seekha hai bhai tumhare saath kaam karke. Robocon ke baad kaafi confidence aaya hai mujhme bhi. Mujhe apna LHC Foyer me discussion yaad hai, intern ke time. Mujhe pata tha ki tu chaapega hi, kyunki kuchh bhi challenge ho, You never give up. Keep this determination towards your goals intact. You’ll reach much greater heights. Aur ab bade aadmi ho gye ho bhai, toh hume mat bhul jaana. Yaad kar liya kro kabhi kabhi.

What an inspiring personality you have been! Funnily enough, we were both on campus for a good two and half years and yet we first interacted at the HCIL HQ in Delhi. The Honda YES experience was definitely a memorable one. The ceremony was even better. And what a speech that was at the ceremony! and ofc, that completely defined your caliber! It's been great getting to know you and I have honestly learned a lot from you. Thank you for the good discussions while applying for YES plus earlier this year. I believe we'll be bearing the responsibility of doing the publicity for the YES program for some more time xD. So, definitely gonna be in touch. Cheers and All the best bhai!

7,"""A guy who dropped obsession to know the importance of life, happiness and relationships."" - Can a bio get more apt! I still remember seeing the passion to build a team and taking it to heights in your eyes the day we sat together in Hall 2 Common Room. If there is one team of all I know, which can make a Quadruped move in a span of 2 hrs with a defective Maxon motor and a faulty circuit, it's that Robocon team. And it didn't come together, I was made - by us! Couldn't have imagined pulling off an inch of what we did in Robocon, had you not been there. I guess, janta toh me pehle hi tha ki Saini is the most passionate guy when it comes to Robotics, dekh bhi liya un 8-9 mahino me. Starting off from scratch is never easy. Never imagined ki ek team bana denge 10 din me jiske liye 550+ recruitment applications aa jayengi and SnT code me 1 question bhi ban jayega (ab reveal kar sakte hai na? xD). Wo SnT code wali raat bhai, kitne maze kiye the.. and uske baad, the entire Robocon journey. 2.5 saal ki campus life me 1 saal to MR1 MR2 hi banate rahe xD. But it has been one of the most centerpiece learnings of my campus life, and all credits to you! Wo saare birthday celebrations yaad hai, saari meetings me backchodi yaad hai, saare serious discussions bhi yaad hai xD
You are a truly special person. Bohot kind, caring and courageous. Tujhse hi kaafi confidence mila hai kaafi cheeze karne ka. Thank you “Saini”, for making me believe that a bunch of inexperienced guys can actually create an autonomous bot and a quadruped from a nominal budget and in an unrealistic time frame. Ever grateful for everything. You have a brave heart and I know, you’ll do great in life ahead and forever! Aur Robocon ke reunion pe milte hai fir xD

Bhai kya machaya hai mech me tune. Tu nhi hota toh kaise paas hote courses me xD
First year me ESC Labs me time spent kiya tha and then, 2nd year ke courses me. Remember the TA202 project? Tere dabbe pe CAD banaya tha shayad last me, bhai kya maze kiye the. I have always perceived you as the most studious, serious guy in the grp. I never was, for sure. But you have definitely inspired me in a lot of ways to focus more and shayad last tak thoda padh liye isiliye. Online sem me bhi saath me exams dena was the only fun moment I remember in the entire lockdown. I used to look up to exams to collaborate and get together to discuss stuff. Trips me bhi ultimate maze kiye hai bhai tere saath. Diu beach wali recording will remain the best. I’ve always enjoyed your company, I know aise jyada baat nhi hoti shayd apni and I apologise for that. I’ll try better ab xD Still, spending the last days on campus with you is something I’ll always cherish. Cricket khelna (read pehli ball pe clean bold hona xD), running jana, khana order karna, Mama Mio visits, ME627 ke assignments samjhna, MS related discussion with Utkarsh and much more. Thank you for all those moments. Looking forward to meeting you over our next trip. Till then, take care. Be cool as you are. Be smart as you are. And keep growing as you always have been. Cheers and All the best bhai!

30,"Do I even need to write a memoir? I am the official and the only “Sunit ka chodu”. Ye mukaam milna is in itself an achievement and speaks of itself. Reflects how much you have shaped me over these years and how much you have inspired me, through every project/course we did together. 1st day of classes, tab se shuru hoke, last day on campus tak! You have been my undefined best friend. Haan ab baat utni nhi ho paati but baaton ki zarurat kise hai. Just grateful for so many moments that I spent with you. So many songs that we jammed together. TA101 ki sleepless nights, subah PE101 me running, tiring but ‘precisely’ satisfactory PHY101 labs, Antaragni’18 - the first ever app ever built, and in what fashion!, ME251 ke assignments, TA201/202 ke projects, ever-soothing football matches, Josh ka gold medal jeetna, random project ideas and countless things to mention in this memoir. Just can’t do this. Bas aage milte rahenge and tab tak, keep this never ending enthu and this fire within to create, alive. Take care bhai, All the best aage ke liye, and Shukriya for everything!",Suyash  Singh,True,60bfc74d659165b3aa645131,Sunit  Gautam

Bhai kahan se shuru karu, sab toh janta hi hai tu. Since ye printed form me aane wala hai, I can only write ki jab bhi padhna, call kar lena bhai. Kisi bhi random technical topic pe discussion start kr denge :p. Because ig that’s one strong thing connecting us together. Right from 1st year, Code Fun Do me collaborate karne se start kiya (Technical Checkpoint #1), fir NYO (Technical Checkpoint #2) - tere saath hi puri intern ki hai bhai wo toh. Shikher ke under same team me kaam karna was a delight! Then, came 2nd year apne kuchh courses common hue (Technical Checkpoint #3). Thermo ki class me quora ke answers padhte the xD. Bhai fir apna Flutter wala discussion, IITK ke 2 major fests ke 1st ever apps apni wing se hi develop hue hai and guess the developers (Technical Checkpoint #4). Fir tu bangalore me macha rha tha, hum log world cup dekh rhe the xD. Intern season me you were a constant information source (Technical Checkpoint #5), GD preparation se leke resume discussions tak, bohot help ki hai bhai. Shayad kabhi formally “Thank you” nhi bol paaya, it was known ig but wo as a feel hamesha thi aur rahegi. Then tune EE me double major ki uspe kaafi discussion hua and I feel it was one the best decisions you made. Software se core ka jump is something that takes a lot of perspective, belief and guts. You have it all. I am amazed and inspired by all that you have been doing since then. EE ke courses pe discussion, IP me itna collaboration xD (Technical Checkpoint #6). Fir toh bhai, apni Dec trip to MP. Itni backchodi bhai. You were the partner in crime for sure, mauj lene se lekar meme game tak, kya sync hai apna. Bhai last months on campus were beautiful with you. Late nights and seemingly important but random discussions on engineering, tech, Julia and core sector ka future were my most exciting talks, still gives me chills (Technical Checkpoint #n). Running with airpods, listening to Brown Munde on loop, getting clean bold on the first ball xD, untimely sabbaticals, Managing Jay Gupta, Paneer banana, Peg banana, sab kar liya bhai saath me. I don’t have words beyond this point. I’m just so much drowned in nostalgia. You have been the centerpiece of everything we have done in the last few days at IITK, will definitely miss those moments badly. Buchas bc ne account hi nhi banaya hai, warna uska bhi likhta. Anyway, concluding all of it, I really appreciate ki tune busy hone ke baad bhi itna time spend kiya hamare saath. I really respect your work, am a fan tbh and you know this. Bas bhai, itna grow kiya hai tune in every aspect of life ki you definitely were and will be the pro-est of the pros. Fuffa naam toh mene hi diya hai, but Sir ki upadhi bhi aapki hi hai haq se. Bas Sir kripa banaye rakhiyega, aapke raj me jee rhe hai bas xD
Chaliye, namaste. Shukriya. Charan Sparsh. Bhuliyega mat hume, aapke shubhchintak _/\_

33,"Yash bhai, I always feel that your’s is a path which you chose, constructed and travelled through on your own. Yes, first year se hi jante hai hum. Ig kisi GC event me hi mile the xD Fir saath me as SGs and then as AMs achha time spent kiya. And then Ayushya ke room pe kaam karna was so much fun. Steering committee se Chairperson tak, apna connection through Senate has been special. Lockdown nhi hota toh aur kaam karte saath me. Senate ko manage karna in an online year was such a challenge and man, how good have you done that! I can vouch for this specially because offline Senate meetings manage karna was so hectic (we have seen Ayushya managing things somehow xD), lucky to have worked in parallel (if not alongside) in the AnC both in 3rd and 4th year. Apni AnC ki core team meets Sethi ke saath will remain in good memory. Bohot mulakat hui hai, now that I think of it, but kabhi treat pe nhi jaa paaye, and there are enough pending xD. Kaafi machaya hai bhai tune, aage bhi aise hi chaapte rehna. Keep the spirit intact. You’ve done a great deal for the student body throughout the last tenure and before that as well. Thanks for all the good times. I’ll stay in touch, milte rahenge. Cheers and All the best bhai!",Suyash  Singh,True,60c24814659165b3aa645dff,Yash  Maheshwari
