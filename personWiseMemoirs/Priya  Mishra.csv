0,Hey Akshay! Remember the conversation on linguistics that somehow turned into a conversation about knives (PS: I still don’t think it’s a good idea to talk about this on any first date) XD. It’s been really fun knowing you. Hope we have some other crazy chat soon! Take care and good luck with everything <3.,Priya  Mishra,True,60c65564659165b3aa6462c9,Akshay
1,"Bro!! Thanks for waking me up for all the linguistic classes. I loved how we always ended up sleeping five minutes through the lecture but chose to sit in the front rows anyway. It’s a wonder we never got kicked out XD. Also, Ananya, it is really creepy to have folders with people’s names on them on your laptop :P. It’s been so great knowing you and I’m glad that we got to hang out so much in the last few days, otherwise, I would have missed your brilliant lap dance and never known your google doc skills. Thanks for always appreciating my puns. Hope to see you soon <3. Take care and stay in touch, you know I’m always here for your drunk texts!",Priya  Mishra,True,60ce6795659165b3aa646483,Ananya  Goswami
2,Hi Anirudh! Priya here XD. I can’t thank you enough for ending my anxiety with the placement results and so glad that your news turned out to be right lol. Had a lot of fun *discussing* ENG with you. Good luck with everything ahead. And may our next chat not be a result of me interrupting your calls :P,Priya  Mishra,False,60cdf871659165b3aa646423,Anirudh Anil Ojha
3,"We started with linguistics bitching in our first sem and ended our last sem doing the same thing XD. I have had so much fun with you - all the random gossips (especially the “aesthetic appeal” discussion at 5 in the morning), your amazing stories, which sometimes made us forget about our classes, and the rooftop nights where we discovered a new (murderous? XD) side of yours. And how can I forget the Y18 orientation, how we vibed, and the interesting incidents that followed. It has been incredible knowing you, and I hope we stay in touch. After all, we UP people gotta stick together :P. Good luck with everything ahead <3. See you soon!",Priya  Mishra,True,60c8f4c2659165b3aa646305,Anshika  Verma
4,"Yo Arzoo! You are hands down, the best roommate ever. Thank you for helping with my very real emergencies during the last days; I’ve never met anyone so brave XD. You always had the solution for everything, and I have rarely seen you lose your calm and composure. It was so fun to see people guessing whether you’re under the blankets or not every time they entered our room. When everyone else would be studying for exams, you’d be on a movie marathon or going out for pizza and coke (I remember our shelf filled with empty cold drink bottles XD). Yet you aced everything! I loved sharing a room with you, you were such an amazing company. Btw, so proud that you finally learned to sleep with your lights off XD. I still owe you that treat, so I hope we meet soon. Good luck with everything ahead. You’re the best <3.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c90ee2659165b3aa646307,Arzoo
5,"Monikaaaa! I would have never survived EE without you, I partially owe my degree to you. Forever in awe of your jugaad skills. You always (quite literally) had the answer to everything. Thanks for all the support during internships. I had so much fun with you these past years and hope we meet again soon. Take care and good luck with everything. You deserve the best <3.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c66a84659165b3aa6462e0,Monika  Rathore
6,"Yo Avz! You are absolutely the sweetest person ever and I love your smile. We’ve had so much fun in our first-year. Be it gossiping in the club, sleeping between the million harmonies we had ya CPA mein fraud maarna. Tujhe kaafi bully kiya hai uss group pe. Btw, where are we on the “Aisa kuch nhi hai yaar” stance now XD. Thank you for always having food and for sneaking it into the library (or sending it to VH). 

You are the cutest Mafia God, and I am so sorry for being a total nightmare that day XD (Seriously dude, I could not keep my eyes closed, I tried!). I’m glad that we got to hang out properly in the last month, otherwise, I would have totally missed your amazing performance (that last shot really did its job, no? XD). Goodluck with everything ahead, you deserve the best. Hope to see you soon <3.

8,"Avisaaa! We’ve come a long way from only meeting on our way to the washrooms to finally moving in together (definitely the next best step for us). Although we didn’t interact much in the first year, we had one memorable conversation, and that was my first impression of you - a pretty chill person and, in hindsight, someone who knows what you really need even if that’s not what you asked for XD. Changing my branch to EE will always be one of the best life decisions I ever make. I can’t imagine how different IITK would have been without you. We opened up beyond academics by randomly talking about first-year incidents, discovering how similarly we felt about those, and since then, we have discussed everything and everyone. 

It was almost a ritual, coming to your room every time I woke up at noon and feeling so great when you were not up either lol (“Lunch ke baad CCD ya RM chalna hai kya?”). The only good thing about EE was that we spent so much of our day together. Taking turns at getting frustrated with the stupid experiments, your witty answers to why we were almost thirty minutes late to the lab, figuring out the entire syllabus a day before the exam (or deciding to go to the canteen instead) - EE would have scarred me for life if it were not for you.

We have SO MANY unforgettable memories. All the late-night walks, the rooftops, the sudden realizations you had in my room, the night outs, the scooty (and horse) rides, and countless others. You’re obviously an easy person to talk to, given the amount of bullshit I have thrown your way. I could always rely on you - somehow, I think you have the power to fix everything. I can be a cagey person, but I will always (eventually XD) tell you everything.

It’s not always easy to find people who you just fit with, which makes me so glad that we met pretty early and I got to experience IITK with you. Even at the busiest times, every time I stopped by your room, we would mostly end up talking for hours. Of course, we complained about how much pending work we had, but now, I think this was a far more productive use of our time XD. You’re one of the most important people in my life, someone whose opinion I value very highly and whom I’ll listen to before anyone else. And it so comforting to know that I’ll always have such an amazing person in my corner.

I will miss being able to just roll out of bed and knock on your door (sorry for the rare interruptions, though). But I know, even if we get busy with our lives outside IITK, we’ll still find the time to catch up (I know how invested you are in my life XD), gossip about the most random stuff, and support each other. I can’t imagine it being any other way!
Love you so much - Your “Priya like person” <3333

P.S. - If you don’t have that stapler, I’ll take the alternative now :)

TL;DR: Bro, you’re awesome. I’m gonna stalk you for eternity.",Priya  Mishra,True,60cb1a8d659165b3aa646341,Avisha

10,"The girl who can hula hoop XD (and is simply the best at it!). I had a great time partying and dancing with you, and I really wish we could have done it more. I am so gonna miss asking you “tu ghar kab jaa rhi”. Take care and good luck for everything, and keep rocking those bangs <3.",Priya  Mishra,True,60c3c539659165b3aa64626c,Deeksha  Yadav
11,"Yo roommate! You were easily the most homesick person on our floor when we first came here. I remember you being so sad during our first week, that I had to bribe you with CCD food to cheer you up. But I am happy this place grew on you (So maybe Kanpur is not that bad after all? XD). I will never forgive you for making me watch Mean Girls on my birthday. First-year was filled with you bringing me up to speed on all the events of the week and sometimes month (thanks to my amazing schedule). And yes, I vividly remember stealing those letters from OAT. I still have those pictures lol. I am glad we got to hangout again in our last sem, especially our VH expedition lol. Hopefully, our intense gossip sessions and movie nights made up for all the hardships you faced on your long trips to my room, and next time we’ll watch Cast Away for sure XD.

12,"Same city, same coaching. Yet, we only met in our third year and properly hung out during our VH trip. Thanks for all the amazing movie suggestions, and advice (“Campus jaane ke liye permission nhi, attitude chahiye hota hai” XD). You are genuinely one of the nicest people I’ve met here, bas thoda bitching karna seekh le. US jaake phir se holi khelte hai please XD. Hope to see you soon <3

13,"I didn’t know you much in our first year, but I was always pissed when you woke me up every time you returned to GHT. The first conversation I recall having with you is the one when we paired up in the chem lab. It was hilarious watching you give me weird excuses for leaving early. But I think we really bonded in our second year, especially the summers. Since then, I have heard so many of your crazy stories, and we have spent countless hours gossiping in my room. 

It was so cute when you started dancing on the streets because you were too excited for your birthday or when you got super mad in that game of twister. We have so many fond memories - struggling to get up for MSO (and me bringing down everyone’s enthusiasm), mi casa dinners, VH wali Holi and the movie nights, that amazing trampoline, and your amazing dance on kajara re second year summers mein. Also, I am pretty sure that someday we’ll have to rescue you when you get kidnapped because you couldn’t say no to a treat :P

I can’t thank you enough for helping me navigate the placement scenario and for all the advice and motivation, without which I would have gone crazy. I really hope you get to go to Hyderabad soon; after all, I know your real motivation behind joining Google! I have seen you face some difficult times here, and I hope you only get the best in the future. You deserve nothing less. May you get your dream cabinet of daaru soon XD. Love you and see you soon <3333.

14,"I can’t remember how we first met, and we never talked regularly over these last years. Still, whenever we spoke, it didn’t matter how much time had passed; it was always easy to ask you for help or discuss the most random thing. Every time we ran into each other at RM, we would stop and complain about how much work we had piled up. But the next instant, we were trying to identify the species of the suicidal cat we just saw or comparing a certain dean to a certain cartoon character XD. You are a wonderful listener. Thank you for distracting me when everything seemed to be crashing down. You have been a constant source of comfort and support during some of the worst times I’ve faced, and it meant the world to me.

I would have really regretted not talking to you more had this been the end of our journey. But yeah, we’ll make up for the lost time at Stanford. We’ve got so much to do, from jumping into that fountain to finding some cool rooftops, and of course, looking forward to your drinking lessons XD. It’s going to be a blast <3.

P.S. - This memoir can’t be complete without a testament to one of our most incredible conversations - Dis civet cat. Kood gaya. R.I.P!

15,"Let me start by saying thank you for making me apply to the first-year summer school. Running in the rain with our bags stuffed in a garbage bag, your amazing talent at asking questions even when you slept through the sessions XD, discovering that beautiful cafe - I had such a great time with you. I remember we were so excited after our first few days there, that we were crazily looking for something else to attend and I really wish we had found something. I have spent so many hours listening to your stories, each one more amazing than the others. I am so glad that you finally found your wing and that I was a part of it, especially since I got to know so much more about you over our chats in the last month. I am sure we’ll meet in US, and find a wonderful cafe to order that espresso and croissant. Good luck with everything ahead and see you soon <3.
P.S. - I did not order that sandwich!

16,"Yo Nupur! You are truly an exceptional stylist. Thanks for the amazing (and most random XD) makeover. It is one of my favorite memories from our last days on campus. I have never met anyone more immune to alarms lol. You are the only person who could sleep through those hundreds of alarms at 3 am in the night. And how can I ever forget your brilliant dance moves? You absolutely killed it. Hoping to see you soon, and maybe this time we’ll find a different cause for Ravi’s death.

18,"Brooooo!. CCD gossips, UC dinners (despite being broke af XD), RM nightouts, Udaipur trip, randomly playing frisbee outside L20 - It’s been so fun hanging out with you these past years.

21,"We met during our first week when you used to come to my room. Obviously, at the time, you were not there to meet me, but I gradually lured you away with food. We spent our first year practically together all the time. You taught me ESC and TA, and I tried (and failed) to teach you how to walk. Our time was mostly spent oscillating between our rooms and club, adjusting to the new environment, and juggling sleepless nights with neverending quizzes. But in the middle of all the rush, I got to know the gem of a person you are -- always loyal to, and ready to go above and beyond for the people you care about. And I am fortunate to have had such a person by my side all these years.

We had fun over the silliest things. Setting up camp under the club table, randomly texting people together, losing our mind over that bible app - half the things we did made no sense lol. I fail to understand how you never messed up a complex task but the simplest things are beyond you. Seriously, who swerves into a tree so far away from the road! And obviously, your iconic walk, constantly pushing me off the sidewalk, you lil piece of shit. But for all that, you’ve put up with a LOT of my antics, whether it was letting me play Pokemon Go on a freezing January night, my very long hair routine, or using you as a shield against the scary campus dogs every day. I’ve troubled you so much these past years with all those ES and south Delhi jokes, being a total hypocrite and breaking into your phone, and cornering you (with some help) during that BSBE hangout :P.

You have been a constant in my life pretty much since the first day. You always had my back and never hesitated to stand up for me. I love how you get angry at every person I am annoyed with, even more so than me on several occasions. You laugh at my lamest jokes (thanks for the validation bro), listen to my insanely ridiculous problems, and tolerate all my drama (all the while rolling your eyes but still). 

It is going to be difficult not having you next door now and I will miss not being a constant pain in your ass. But I know that this was just the Kanpur chapter of our journey, and we have so much more to look forward to. I am certain that you will always have the time for my melodrama, and you will always be there cheering me on. Love you so much. <33333.
