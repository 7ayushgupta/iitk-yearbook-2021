Over the four years, I have learned so much from you, especially how to be calm and keep your cool even in the most intimidating circumstances. You have always helped me whenever I needed it. All the classes that we attended together in our first year, assignments, exams, discussions, the fun we had in our rooms, Antagragni, trips, and other events are reminiscent memories. Also, your shenanigans made me laugh every time and forget about any tough day I had, and of course, the long hours of cricket playing will always be a pleasant memory for me. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors, and I have complete faith in you that you will succeed and fulfill your dreams. 

PS: I hope the book Undercover Economist is a gift for me from you :)",Sathvik  Bhagavan,True,60aa63c2819323d199d49450,Naman Agrawal (M Agrawal)
