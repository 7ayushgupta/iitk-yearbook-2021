Sabse pehle intern lagwa ke launda phone pr busy ho gaya tha. Saale jab bada aadmi ban jaayega, tab yaad krna humme bhi. I know you will achieve great heights in life.

2,"Yo!
Ta202 was so much more fun than Ta201, I wasn't able to find the reason though xD. 
We don't have many memories together, but I enjoyed whatever time we spent.
I hope we bump into each other someday to create more memories.
Best of luck for the future!

We did projects together one too many, that I don't even remember all of them. Some of them were Ta202, ESO203, correct me if I am wrong. You are the most helpful and jolly person I met in the campus.  Apan milenge future mai kabhi, jab to bada aadmi ban jaayega xD.

Itna squash khela saath mai, you made all that time more fun and amusing. I would never forget the time of summer camp, it was one of my favourite memories of campus life and you were a part of it. Aise hi khush aur haste rehna. Squash match lagayenge kisi din.

Nonetheless that night was fun, I hope we could meet again someday. Since you know I am shy, I don't have much to say XD.

10,"""I hope you don't forget to write the memoir, deadline is approaching soon"" 😪
This word ""DEADLINE"" motivated me to start writing memoirs, everybody would relate to this. Agar koi mujhse puchega, why did you write memoirs, my answer would be ""NIKITA""
We don't have much memories together, but you are the sweetest solution one could get given the equations.
The most memorable experience was the night we got out for a walk, I regret not having spent more time with you, but I hope someday, we could continue our walk.
Mumbai mai jaake agar kisi din actor ban gayi, toh mujhe mat bhoolna, jisne yeh idea diya tha xD. I would love to say, I told you so.
I know you to be an innocent and fearless person, born to achieve great heights in life, so go ahead and get'em, you deserve it.

It was in fact a life-altering time, but the course had little to do with it. It was because of a newly found friend. I was reluctant to write this, because I am not very good at ""good-byes"", nonetheless, here we go.
I hope you don't cut off mark for my writing skills. Classes would have been a nightmare if it weren't for you. The most memorable experience was the day out, In fact, that day turned out to be pretty interesting, quite opposite to my expectations. 
I guess you would be the youngest Spellman who has achieved the meaning of her life xD. Now that you have done it, I hope someday you help me achieve mine.
You were born to achieve great things and one day you will, remember to call me that day, so that I could say ""I told you so""

Hum zyada mile nahi, infact poore 4 saal nahi mile, pr end mai jo mile maza aya. Saath mai volleyball, woh net mai tumhara serve maarna xD. Aur uss din woh tumhara manoranjan, uske baare mai toh kya hi bolu 
Maza aaya yr, tumhare baare mai jaanke aur tumhari kalakriti dekhne mai, umeed hai tumse fir mulaqat hogi

Hum zyada mil nahi paaye, jabki hum kaafi baar saath mai ek hi train mai jaate rahe xD. 
Pr jab mile toh kya hi maza aaya, aakhri journey campus aate waqt, aur fir woh Hall-12 vs Hall-3. Kya hi epic battle thi woh, mazza aa gaya uss din anthem gaa kr.
Fir kabhi gaayenge jab mauka mila bhai

16,"Yo Tushar! I wasn't planning on writing this memoir for you because I think or at least I hope we will be in constant touch in the future. 
But, you never know so here I go. 
Pehle 2 glass dhoke laa, uske baad padhna shuru krna. I don't remember the first time we officially met, but I won't forget the last time month we spent together. 
Tera har ladki se milne se pehle itna tyaar hona, chahe woh K hi kyun na ho
Out of nowhere woh D waala twist, maine aur kunal ne kya kya nahi soch liya tha ki aaj toh launda chaap kr hi aayega
 But as usual you pulled off a ""Tushar"" and proved both of us wrong.
I regret one thing ki mai tujhe Amin toofani nahi bana paya, but mujhe bharosa hai tujhpe you will do it on your own.
Don't ever underestimate yourself, you are a box full of talents ready to be exploited. I know you will achieve great things in life, more than you would've imagined. Isiliye just be patient and tinder plus use krna start krde XD, le dunga mai tujhe, idea aa gaya mujhe.
 P.S. I tried hard not to use bc anywhere in this memoir, but o more MILTE REHNA BC

You are undoubtedly one of the cutest individual I have met on campus. I don't remember any time when I asked for help and you didn't. Intern ke time who Nutanix wala prank intentional nahi that bro, list mai sach mai tera naam that xD. I hope to bump into you in the future.
