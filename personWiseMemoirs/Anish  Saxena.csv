0,"It's 9ish AM in summer of 2018 and people are coming to my room, frantically searching for you. Why? Because you overslept and missed your fucking midsem, you absolute unit xD
Man, we've come a long way.
We probably got the least likeable room in 2nd year and yet we were able to beautify it towards the end,  getting it repainted twice in the span of a month! We've tripped in Lucknow, in our room, in others' rooms, on top of buildings, and probably other places I was too wasted to remember. Oh, and remember the time we had to sleep outside our own room on New Year because of the ""party"" we threw? xD
I was always surprised at how nonchalantly you got things done, none more than the day you got the intern on day 1 after we did our round of rr in H1 canteen the day before, over biryani and pity discussions with seniors, like one does. And then there's that time when we had our TA202 (or 201) quiz and collectively agreed: fuck it, nai padhna.
I also greatly admire our unassuming yet meaningful friendship: no bs, no small talks. It's been an amazing last few years being your roomie and friend, and I look forward to meeting you soon where we can reminisce, crack open a cold one and probably get some herbal therapy on the side :D",Anish  Saxena,True,60c227a2659165b3aa6459dd,Aditya  Sonthalia
1,"There's one person who actually inspired me to try out long hair, which was just a passing thought at that point, and that was you in the first sem. And then we finally met in earnest during PClub's winter camp. Mishra ko galiyane se lekar mujhe random places mei middle finger dikhane tak, not to mention that night where we played contact all night long, courtsey Machi's absurdly complex words, winter 2017 was where we first ""vibed"".
Our chai sessions were always on point, be it outside KD or at my room. And then there's your contagious obsession with sports, which made us both kinda break our backs swimming and playing tennis back to back xD And remember the frisbee sessions in the evenings of summer 2019? Man, you know i'm not great with sports, but much of what I've played outside the hall has been with you.
And then there's the fact that we vibe, a lot, like A LOT LOT. I can't recall a place where I haven't hanged out with you on campus, lol. The Irish tea party is due, ofcourse :P You live life like it should be lived, and I absolutely love that. Also cheers to the day(s) when we had herbal therapy (Hi Sonty) and we partied literally like there's no tomorrow lmao
OS ke confessions se lekar New Year and chai party tak, it's been an amazing few years with you. Here's to many more such adventures and ofcourse, OTB Chess, with you :D",Anish  Saxena,True,60c231b3659165b3aa645ae9,Bhavy  Singh
2,"Jindal Bro! 
Do you recall that time we ended up in Hall 1 during the treasure hunt? xD And how we pulled an all-nighter (almost) for LIF101 exam? And how we have probably sat together in most IC courses lol.
Man, we've come a long way. But some things never change. The parties outside campus evolved into Biryani by Kilo deliveries. And the ones in campus just got wilder xD
There are wayyy too many things we've done together, from collecting chanda in Antaragni to hanging out in KD to unsuccessfully trying to maintain a gym routine (atleast for me) lmao. 
Our bulla sessions have been a respite for me from the fast paced life on campus. Your room was my go-to pad in the first couple of years. Your chill af yet diligent attitude always inspires me. And btw you're the Sharma Ji ka beta to my parents lol.
Here's to more fun, bullas, and get-togethers in the near future! Cheers bro, keep doing amazing things!!",Anish  Saxena,True,60cf8898659165b3aa64684c,Vaibhav  Jindal
