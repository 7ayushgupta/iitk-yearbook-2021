I know everything you did required patience and dedication, I know it wasn’t easy for you to get out of your comfort zone but there wasn’t even one single time when you backed out.

I know I can get too competitive and sometimes it can be difficult but you never uttered a word. I am extremely happy for us to have crossed many challenges that came in our relationship. It was as close to ideal as WE could get. We had our quirks and weirdness. I like having really conversations with you, I love sharing the ""we could go to jail for this"" humor with you.

I will always spell your name wrong. I will always end it with an R and always call you each of those ""not at all offensive"" words :). Kitna bhi rr karle tu, I will always tease you for what you ""have"" and ""do not have."" Because I have full Faith in our friendship (😉).

When we first met, I didn't know what was going on under the hood, and I guess neither did you. You started a streak for my birthdays. Jab mujhe Mudreka ne bola ki poem likh raha hai tu, I thought vo mock kar raha hai meko.  I hope that trend never ends. I always loved your gifts, kaafi efforts bhare hote the unme. I felt a different beautiful connection with you. Gh ke saamne vaali net ke paas jo hum baithe the, vo night hi best lagti hai mujhe aaj tak, that was the first time you kinda opened up. 

Uske baad to walks exponentially hi badh gayi, kaafi campus naap liya humne. I learned a lot un walks pe and I know you did too. Kitna fattu hai tu yaar. Green vaali night mein tune hi concepts batae the and teri hi fat gayi😂.  Kaafi saari baate aisi hai jo likhi nai jaa sakti and shayad likh ke unki importance kam ho jaegi par you still have a special place in my life which will remain reserved for you

Even though our interactions got limited. I am glad to still have that near-perfect connection every time we talk. I know agar apan 10 saal ke baad bhi baat karenge to bhi I can make infi fun of you. Vaise tujhe apni deal yaad hai na? Bhulna mat vo. :)

Avisha, writing this memoir is difficult for me because you earned too many adjectives for you, but listing them may make this memoir look cliche or maybe fake, and I don't wanna do that. I also won't detail our memories here because I know there are many, and they are beautiful. Writing some of those here won't do justice to the others.

Yes, I opened up to you in second-year summers, and a partial reason was what I confessed at the rooftop. That night was exceptional for me because you made sure I knew that you won't judge me. You have always been a good listener and helped me through my worst of times in college.  I wish I could say that most people don't deserve your friendship, but I think that would be selfish. 

Your love for strange things always amazed me because it reflects that you could notice things other people can't, which is why people love you. Sometimes I may have not reacted as I should have, but that may be because I was jealous of the people getting close to you. But thank you for being such a good listener and for finally making me realize that you've got my back.

I hope we can meet again on our trip. Till then, farewell, amigo!

When I look back at the dandiya night of our second year, I saw a cake in someone's hand and the person said ""Ayush ka birthday hai, aaja upper crust ka cake hai 😅"". I am so glad that I love free cake and Nutella. Lemme spill out some more cringe for you, you are obviously a remarkable person, but more importantly, you know how to be a REAL friend. You helped me a countless number of times in my whole college life. There were many instances when I was like, ""chill hai, Ayush hai"". Be it any course or need for a partner in crime, you were there. 

You understood my dark humor that most campus junta couldn't (tujhe bhi poora nai samajh aata tha, but I can work with that). You could sometimes (SOMETIMES) read my expressions and would warn me to use a filter. The list goes on and on. I most liked that you are a great secret keeper and try not to show your judgments (judge sab karte hai obviously). You always had a good movie, bean bag and snacks in your room (or I added in your canteen account :p). You always made my birthdays super special(when you didn’t forget) and thanks for the cookies, next time it is your duty to bring double the amount of the same cookies. And, I think this goes without saying that treats are always on you for the rest of our lives xD

The moments we spent meant a great deal to me, dinners, treats, walks (especially at 6am), rooftops, classes, LHC, photoshoots(remember second year ke end vaala :)). I'll miss you a lot, seriously, especially when I'll be drinking a super expensive scotch from my personal bar or when I'll see a sports car passing by. I'll miss our cycling trips with your choice of music and my choice of path.

This being said, don't ever think that I will stop making fun of you. You will always be ""chaar baal ka taqla"" or ""Brag-queen"" for me. A guy(?) with bubble-gummy shoes, whom I convinced to ditch a porn-set university.

But whenever anyone asks me about you, I may say that he is the one person who will take responsibility for his actions, who has principles and is passionate about his views and opinions(I admire that so much about you btw). And despite all these descriptions are accurate, what I'll really want to say is that Kushagra is a feeling. He is an experience that can not be described; one would have to water the friendship enough for the greener grass to grow (Flowers are ugly). 

I respect you an insane amount for who you are and how you've become what you are. You are one hell of a loyal friend, and I know I can always count on you. I know my secrets are undoubtedly safe with you. The talk we had that afternoon was difficult for me too, but you made that a unicorn ride. You can expect the same amount of loyalty from my side because it is a two-way street, and I'll be happy to wave at you while crossing. The truth is you didn't pick up the phone that day; I called you first <3. 

When we first met, I thought we'd never click because you were a snob, and so was I, and yet it matured with listening to my never-ending talks to a hand on my shoulder with the words ""I am here for you."" So here's an ode to our non-judgemental friendship.

Love you loads <3

49,"Hii Aunty,
Vaise to mai nai likh paati zyada par I can write books for you. Memoir likhna fir bhi tough hai kyuki bohot bhasad hai likhne ko dimag mein jise usually tu hi organize karti thi. My advice to all: Agar Medha ko sirf 25 percent bhi follow kar liya na to poori college life optimize ho jaegi. Kaafi chaapu hai tu aise hi rehna.

Ab sun, kyuki life mein sirf ek hi baar bolungi, you are the sweetest, kindest and PUREST person on this whole fucking planet. Pehli baar drying area ki bench pe mile the and ghanto baat karte rahe the, poore possible topics cover kar liye the us din, Fiitjee, Meerut, ex, KGP and blahhh. College life bhi humne usi tarah usi jagah baithkar end ki, usse better nai ho sakta tha last day apna. Bhale hi GALTI se tujhe itna door room de diya ho par vo kabhi bhi reason nai raha mere na aane ka. Tera room apne jaisa lagne laga tha. Kahi se bhi aati thi to pehle D731 mein aati thi. Sorry(nope) for 11:30pm things. You are the reason I don’t hate lockdown. Kisi bhi time pe no time limit vaale calls, millie/coco ke videos, VCs and many other things you did for me. Jab tujhe Bye karke upar aayi thi tab tera room dekhke realize hua ki it will never be the same. Kaafi time tak tere room ke lock ko stare kar rahi thi, hall office vaala tha na ki jo maine lagaya tha second-year ki summers mein. Tab pata chala firse ki “it’s not the place, but people”. And I got the best people🖤. Haan teri baat kar rahi hoon gawar. You know my deep deep deepest secrets jo mai kisi ko batane ka soch bhi nai sakti. You see through me like your white kurta(I love that btw).  Tu hadd special hai mere liye jitna tu soch bhi nai sakti. Poori Stats tune and tere notes ne padhai hai mujhe and seriously mere grades improvement ke credits bhi tujhe hi jaate hai. I survived on this campus because of you. 

Mai literally kaafi kuch aur likh sakti hoon tere baaare mein par kahin to rukna padhega. Bina mile US gayi to mai kabhi baat nai karungi. I find this word super lame but you are lamer, so here, “bestie”. Always be my 2 AM buddy. I love you so much that I can share my food with you🖤

I may have been harsh to you a lot of times but that is just because I care a lot for you. You just mean so much to me that the thought of something bad happening to you scares me. 
The time we spent in the first year was magical, you have so much energy and a super fresh way of looking at things. You can make things psychedelic just by talking about it.  I loved that time so much. But don’t you worry about that chodu. Even if we lose contact in the future, remember I'll just be one ring away. I'll always welcome you with open arms. 
I don’t know where you will be but I wish you all the luck I have for your future endeavors.
Love you so much, weirdo.

62,"Hello ""summers best friend,""

What if I told you that sometimes gems are just served on a silver platter? Won't believe it right?, I have proof of it in the room next door (yes, I am talking about you, smarty). 

I've never in my entire life met such a hardworking person as you. You never tried to bullshit your way through stuff, be it useless mso chapter or shitty placement companies, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. You deserve great success in your life. 

I don't know how you patiently heard all of my rants, and every time, you calmed me down. You were my savior living next to me. I remember we met through Avani in the first year, but the main bonding started in our second year. I'll miss randomly going to liquid and ordering three huge tiramisus (Man, those were delicious). I may have progressed in my second year, but you are the reason I could do that. You always motivated me to study. I could just drop into your room anytime and come back with all of the stress gone. I saw you vibing with your courses so dedicatedly that I tried to do that myself. So yeah, thanks for that.

You are like a sister to me, and I will miss you so much. Don't you dare forget me after going to Stanford.

I remember sometimes you were very easily able to guess my mood and came to check if I was okay, that felt super special. You remember in the first year, I knew you were chaapu so I sat next to you in exams to copy from your sheet but couldn’t understand much, thanks to your ""awesome"" handwriting :), then I asked you directly and you said, ""Umm, I don’t cheat "". I admired you so much because unlike me, you had principles. 

You remember Antaragni and birthdays vaala time third-year mein, Apan chaaro ka best time lagta hai mujhe vo, also do you remember Diwali mela, trampoline kharidne ka mann ho gaya tha almost mera tab. I just loved your Birthday gift, kitna sahi tha vo.
