And here we are what we can call as virtual best friends✌️. You are amazingly weird guy with a lots of cousins and a person who is extremely obsessed with the organization of things (which I love btw) xD. Hope we'll survive rest of the semesters and the placements together as we survived this year. Definitely last yr would have been boring without you. Hope we'll make infinite more memories together in our last yr on campus (if we ever returned :p). Cheers to our friendship 🤟

8,"Hey old roomie! Thanks for being such an amazing roommate. One thing I'll always be proud of is that our room was one of the cleanest rooms in our batch xD. I'm gonna miss so many things - aunty ke chocolate filled cakes (which I stole everytime :p), your M club posters and my wall painting, all those gossips about random people and random bitching, eagerly waiting for each episode of GOT, our alarms ringing alternatively and we procrastinating getting up for hours and so much more. Thanks for always listening to me - I could literally tell you everything knowing that you will keep it a secret. Thanks for making me try that blueberry yoghurt and for filling the CS form for me and priya :p. One time you wore a one-piece and straightened your hair...that day will always be remembered xD.  
I still remember how you somehow end up getting injured all the time in first year... ped se takra jana, cycle se gir jana, washroom me phone gira dena lol. You are a bunch of talent. I still don't know how many more hidden talents you have .... music painting studies and so much more, chalo at least we can leave dancing :p Wish you all the luck for the new journey you're gonna start. You will always have a special place in my heart. Just remember I am just a phone call away<3. ""Keep Smiling"" and keep rocking!",Ritika  Ajmera,True,60a665cc819323d199d48f85,Swadha  Pandey
