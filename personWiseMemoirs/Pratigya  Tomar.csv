What do you eat every morning that you are so damn energetic! I have enjoyed our swing conversations and midnight strolls a lot.
You are an amazing artist, and I still have that Rick and Morty mini-painting you drew for me. FYI, I also have your ‘Haaye Huku Haaye’ video and thanks for reviving the ‘Basanti’ video every year -_- 
Stay the same and take care  <3",Pratigya  Tomar,False,60a5528a819323d199d48543,Akshay
1,"Hey Archit!
Still remember meeting you for the first time in our TA meeting, you give off very intellectual vibes. Can’t think of anyone else who is more of a ‘Krishna Janamashthi’ enthusiast, lol. Thanks for bearing me during the TA labs and for being so nice and genuine. 
Wishing you all the best for your future <3

2,"Zuzuuu!
Only rarely do you meet people for a brief amount of time and become so fond of them. Your reactions literally make my day, your savage responses and your laziness. When the rest of the campus was busy cramming during exams, you would literally watch movies because you were always prepared (Except the 8th sem LOL)!! I will always remember 'The Night you guys went to RM and the after events'.
Anyhow, Stay sassy and take care <3

Met you 4 years ago, and one inferno/mid sem later, we were practically inseparable. Our friendship is an epic one, from helping you send texts/replies, to us sending risqué texts together, from me explaining you kinky stuff to you explaining me ‘GM’, from me annoying you by being super chatty to now you joining and suggesting weird things to do together. Our journey made you open and, it kept me grounded. You have brightened my life with your positivity and kindness.
The best roommate I could ever have had. My partner in crime. Thank you for always listening to me and making me feel comfortable, for dancing and singing your heart out with me, also for bringing Soya Sticks but most importantly, for being lazy, crazy and weird with me. Always remember I am just one text/call away, no matter where we go or what we do. 
The Stock the Stock event, The crime room, Late-night conversations, Game Nights, planning photoshoots, making reels, making graffiti, the sleepovers, the Polaroids, and so much more. It was WHOLESOME!!
Life is a circle. I started my IITK journey with you and Ritika at GHT, you being my roommate, and ended it the same way at GH, and for that, I am eternally grateful. Love You<3
PS: Let’s keep influenzzing!!
PPS: Are you lost, Babygirl?  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°

5,"My All-Time Lab Partner. Photo Club Secy xD
We have been lab partners from the 3rd semester till the very end. I still remember the weird things we have done and the fraud in almost every lab xD. Thanks to you, my Aero experience was beautiful; it literally would be impossible without you. From selecting courses to homework to lab reports to Matlab assignments, we have been through everything together. 
And obviously can’t forget to mention the stellar performance you gave in the galaxy video, lol. Honestly, I love how you are always so calm and how you came to me bid me bye. Will miss our gossips. Till we meet again, stay awesome and skinny (If you want) :P
Lots of love <3 ",Pratigya  Tomar,True,60a53ea7819323d199d48445,Avani  Shrivastava
6,"'ello mate (You gotta show me your brit accent btw)
Cheers to the great conversations, delicious meals and the midnight walks we have had on campus. Our first meeting was epic and will remain a secret xD
Thanks for sticking around and listening to me rant. I still have the list of movies you made for me, will watch them all (Hopefully)
Till we meet again. Take care <3

8,"The only person I know who would wear a swimming cap to avoid rain xD
It was so much fun to do the photoshoot with you; you would always give your inputs and bring in the pizzazz. Thank you for your positivity and those amazing and interesting stories (more like gossips). Also, for the Gutthi meme, lol.
Stay the way you are, always! 
Lots of Love, pseudo-behna <3",Pratigya  Tomar,True,60a54427819323d199d4847f,Deeksha  Yadav

To the most fluid human ever, who would do whatever others would ask to (Angrez!). Love the summer of 2018 because I made such amazing friends in the summer camp. I have always enjoyed having night strolls with you, randomly chatting, having fun during those crazy game nights or going out with the baddy group. Even if we didn’t meet every day, we would still act crazy around each other and have a blast; I could be my goofy self and be so comfortable around you all. 
Sadly, we couldn’t perform a duet in DE ever hope we could just dance around the next time we ever meet. Anyhow, cheers to all the good times and hoping we would make new memories. Let’s plan a tripppp na :p
PS: Still wouldn’t forget how you hid certain things from us -_-

10,"Stone Henge. Explosion. Anime Intros. Kawai >.<
Honestly, if there’s anything I learned with you is that Anime intros are bops! 
Love your weird impressions (you know of whom), how dedicated you are once you commit to things and how you have always helped me as much as you could.
All the best for your journey ahead, hope to see you soon <3

Our anchoring was quite eventful lol, and I had a lot of fun that night. I remember us being in the same TA group and creating a lot of mess.
Anyhow, wishing you all the best for your future. Take care :)

Glad to have met you in these 4 years, otherwise I would have missed your poetry and a LOT of memes!! Thank you for being so nice and easy to talk to all the time. You somehow managed to gain weight during the quarantine, congrats for that. Anyhow, stay the same, and all the best for your life ahead. Take care <3

14,"To my bulla partner. My safe place. My 3 am conversation buddy
You are someone I can always laugh with; even at my worst, I am my best self with you. We have cried in front of each other, been a wreck together, and chatted for hours together. You have always supported me, reassured me when I was feeling low, cheered for me and have accepted all my flaws and, so have I. You like someone because of their qualities but you love someone DESPITE all their qualities, and you, Ritika, have my heart. 
Thank you for always comforting me, joining me in craziness but above all for teaching me weird slang (Chakku, Dhoti etc!) and bringing Satu<3!! Thank you for being the Monica to my Rachel. Always remember, “I’ll be there for you!”
Our late-night conversations, long phone calls, Rooftop Adventures, doing your make-up, clicking a thousand pictures together, making graffiti and so much more. It was all BEAUTIFUL!
Life is indeed a full circle. I started my IITK journey with you and Priyal at GHT, you being my ultimate bulla partner, and ended it the same way at GH, for that, I am eternally grateful. Love You<3

15,"Hiiiii Vipulllllll!!!
‘Bihar ka amir aadmi’. If ‘nautanki’ was a person, it would be you, literally!
The best thing that came out of summer camp’18 was our baddy group. It is literally a gift to be able to talk as much as you do (nonsense mostly, but okay :P). In all honestly, you make everyone laugh a lot and are so easy to talk to. Can never forget how you took me late to my own birthday celebration, our mini but amazing trips to Blue World and Lucknow. Cheers to all the fun times during fests, random game nights or while eating delicious meals together with the baddy group. Let’s make a trip plan and try to make it successful this time ;P
Hope to meet you soon in Noida, take care<3
