You're one of the most humble persons I have ever met and the best roomie I could/would ever get. Bro apni toh itni memories hai and future me bhi hongi, yaha likhna toh formality hogi but ok.

Starting from the day-1, I was worried ki mera roomie kaisa hoga but after I met you, tabhi pta chal gya tha ki I have got such a calm and nice roomie. Mere parents bhi first day hi samjh gye the ki I have got such a nice roomie. Also hum dono hi kitna shy the xD. Uske baad to kitna maja kia h wing me. First year me toh apni classes ka time alag tha and baaki time tu mostly Athletics me rehta tha.. so I got some time alone (ykwim 😛). You never complained about anything and roomies hone k baad bhi humne kabhi kisi chhoti si baat pe bhi ladai nhi ki ❤️. 

Second year me bhi no doubt firse roomies. Tera (Apna) breakfast almost hamesha hi miss hota tha xD. When you (and Abhinav) got to know something, and kaafi discussions huye xD. Kaafi stories share ki h and kaafi kuch seekha tujhse. Apni sath me jada trips to nhi huyi but apne Dharmshala wali trip ab tak ki best thi. Unplanned trip, unplanned trek.. sab kuch me bhot maja aya. Kaise apan ne Tarish ko Trek k liye push kia, raatko vo camping.. everything was fun.

Canteen/Shop C/Mama Mio/Oat/Z square kahi bhi jana ho toh mostly sath me hi gye h and it was always fun. Tu kaafi chaapu hai and I am sure tu kaafi acha krega life me. Jaldi se apni lab set up krle 😛 and fir PhD and fir New Zealand me bhi settle hona h 😛. Campus me jo last 30 days beetaye, was the best thing that happened to me after 2020, thanks to you and other wingies. Yaar campus k day-1 se Kanpur me last day tak sath me the.. even when I was leaving Kanpur, bus stand pe bhi ham sath me the ❤️❤️. I am sure hamara ye bond poori life rahega and milte rahenge ofc. I feel myself really lucky that I met you.

All the best for your future!
Love you bro ❤️❤️

I know tune memoirs public toh krne h nhi but still likh hi deta hu xD. Sabse pehle mai tujhe TA201 me mila. Bro kaafi maza aya tha vo tatti sa project krne me.. vo blades wala (kya naam tha bc).. Yaar vo pura na ho pata agar tu usko ghar se complete na krwake lata xDD.
Uske baad thoda bhot hi/hello ho jata tha.. then hamare ML k exams me ek sath seat thi :P.. Hum dono ek dusre k bharose aate the exam dene xD. Fir same internship.. kaafi maja aya usme bhi. tbh starting me toh mai thoda disappoited tha kyunki mujhe laga tha ki hum same team me honge toh dono hi fraud maarenge lmao but aisa nhi hua xD. Kaafi ache se nikl gyi internship.

""Tu chutiya"".. ""Nhi mai chutiya nhi hu"" xD. 

First year me toh I knew you from Sayak's dp and as a person who used to spam fb. Fir uske baad when you became part of spam group, tab interaction hone laga.

Uske baad toh kitne games khele h hamne! Especially pubg.. jisme you have always been noov.. emulator pe khelke bhi hagta tha. Kaafi ladaiyan ki h humne and kaafi maja ata tha usme xD. You used to record your gameplay just to prove that you are not a noov lmao. Valorant thoda theek thak khel leta h but usme bhi hagta hi h. Reyna toh tujhse na ho payega. Uske alawa Z**2 gye the sath me and MamaMio in the last days at campus and it was fun.

Anyway milte h jaldi hi (group trip krte h) and thoda khelna kam kr and placements pe thoda dhyan de. All the best!

Kaafi memories h hamari and I am very lazy to write (for the second time now ;-;) but still here we go.

First year me toh I knew you as ""Harsh, Abhinav ka coaching batchmate"". I don't remember when we talked for the first time but it was regarding grades I guess.

I got to know you more from second year. I still remember CS201 k endsem me tu 1 ghanta late aaya tha exam dene xD fir bhi chaap dia. I guess hamara interaction mostly spam grp k baad hua tha.. and classes me ho jata tha irl. Fir you, me and Sayak decided to work under Pramod sir.. and summers me unka kaam (fraud?) kia 😛. Bro tu kuch bhi achieve kr skta h you just need motivation.. jaise maine and Sayak ne tujhse PVF k naam pe sab code krwa lia tha xD.

Third year me toh fir we took that project as UGP. I still regret hame vo 9 credits ka ugp lena chahiye tha but ok. And yeah ICPC dia sath me (noovs us). Uss sem toh hamne kaafi gariyaya certain profs ko (ykwim 😛). Anyway ro-dho k nikal gya vo sem. And yeah internship drive me jo BT hui thi, agar savior Adobe na aati toh hamara kya hota!! But it ended well. Fir toh sixth sem k baad toh teri dasse ki streak start ho gyi xD (bade log).

Last k 30 days on campus were really fun. Thanks for the wing photoshoot and oximeter whenever required. And yeah ab toh same hi jagah job h (hopefully) toh onsite hone k baad parties toh krte rahenge obv (mai daaru nhi peeyunga though ;-;). Chal all the best for your future. I know tu chaapta rahega.

23,"Hello PP,

I guess finally the day has come and I don't think ab yearbook deadline or badhegi. Kaafi time se procrastinate kr rha tha tera memoir likhne ka, but here we go now. 

First to hum tab mile the jab tu Astro club k kaam se Tarish k (a.k.a. mere) room aata tha. Uske baad we became friends on fb, at that time I thought you would be just another ""fb"" friend but didn't know what was coming in the next three years (forever).

Uske baad toh humara interaction tab jada hone laga when you became a part of Spam group. Uske baad toh hamne kitne maje kiye hai. To CCD/OaT/random MamaMio hangouts/Badminton/Z square... kya kuch nhi kia hamne. Kabhi bhi raat ko MamaMio ya Kathi rolls ya kahi bhi jana ho toh you were the go-to person. 

After my wingies, maine tere sath hi sabse jada hangout kia hoga. I still remember we went to Anaicha's and it was fun. Kaafi time toh tu hamare wing me hi rehta tha and kaafi bulla kaata h hamne. Kitni baar maine tujhe canteen me treat di h 😤 return my money.

Uske alawa Pubg bhi kaafi khela h and tu kitna noov tha (hai) xD. Valo me bhi xD. Messenger pe toh tu hamesha active hota h. Kitni baar tune social media chhodne ka try kia but you fail as usual. Kabhi bhi kisi ki bitching krni ho, kuch share krna ho ya kuch bhi random spam krna ho toh you have always been there. Kitne hi logo ki bitching ki h.. can't write here xD.

Yaar, ye covimd k karan kitne plans adhoore reh gye. Ek bhi trip nhi ho payi sath me ;-; . Vaise mujhe lagta tha ki tu kabhi daaru ya nashe nhi krega, like you used to say always. But uss din toh tune sabko shock kr dia xD. I still remember that drunk call, kuch achi achi baate boli thi tune xD. Chal maje kr. Anyway, last ka one month spent at campus was really fun. Kaafi maje kiye.

Hamari toh friendship hamesha hi aise rahegi, so memoir toh bas formality tha. Anyway milte h jaldi hi (Hopefully in Lko 😉).

Kaafi kuch h likhne ko and I was procrastinating but I don't thik deadline ab further extend hogi, so here we go.

Ek dum start me toh I knew only Lakshay from your wing and he introduced you as a chaapu CSE guy, who plays CoC. Uske baad I guess you started tagging me in fb even though we hadn't talked irl. Uske baad spamming wagrah se start hua I guess.

I guess first year summer of code was the first time we worked together. Tab kaafi fraud hua lol but it was fun. Uske baad toh second year me third sem me toh CS201 me tune alag level pe chaap dia. I guess fourth sem se we started teaming up for assignments, agar tu na hota toh mere CSE courses kaise niklte xD. By hook or by crook hum assignments kr hi lete the. If you remember CS220, kitna chutiya bnaya h TAs ko lab me xD.

Uske baad second year summer me ek sath Pramod sir wala kaam (fraud) kia. Kitne sapne dekhe the uss time lol and Deepak se kaise kaam krwa lia xD. Oh ICPC bhi to dia tha lmao. Third year me toh kitna galiyaya h certain profs (ykwim) ko xD... oh wait second year me bhi kitna galiyaya h. Fifth sem was horrible but chill h.. (that plagiarism moment 😢). Sixth sem me thank god kisi tarah Compilers nikal gya. But who knew that would be the last time we would meet.. yaar Covid ki mkc.

How could I not mention PoGo. Kitni raids/late night hunts ki h sath me.. Library me jaake pokemons pakdte the and it was always fun.. Teri Snorlax k sath wali photo xD.. would miss all of this a lot. Uske alawa pubg bhi kitna khela h. AoB vs Mallu warriors, it was always a healthy and fun fight xD. CoC too.

Yaar kitna bola tha tujhe campus jaldi aane ko and see tu nhi aa paya.. but chill h milenge jarur. And I trust you.. bakchod jagah PhD krega and needless to say kaafi chaapega life me. Chill h.. meet soon. Love you ❤️
