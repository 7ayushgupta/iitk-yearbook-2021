1,"Ah...those days of romance. 
July 22, 2017.
First day in IIT Kanpur, first time in hostel. I entered my allotted room: 320, 2-top, Hall 3. The only thing I see is a jeans hung on a crooked nail on the wall, dumped on it is a green checkered shirt with rolled up sleeves. Delhi guy. I knew.
The next thing I remember is comparing our Motos with the feeling of a certain brotherhood that two guys with same phone share. The next thing I remember is discussing our expectations and our favorite movie stars ;).
I never felt how happening a single room could become, when we built our own door closing system, when you kept sleeping till 10 on PHY101 lab exam and when the pole dancers and poles came together XD.
Stealing hotspots, playing tennis on Tauaa tables, snoring off while the room's door got replaced, wandering in bhoot bangla looking for a broken hockey stick during treasure hunt....
Bogged down by so many memories, the floods never seem to end. But this is a flood I do want to drown into.
Hell of a great things we did in that damn room. Never to forget the bromance ;-)
Who knows when our lives cross paths again, but surely when it does, I'm sure it'll be a Kodak moment.
So long, friend.
Btw, I still couldn't understand Maeri.",Prabhat Kumar Singh,True,608054a6819323d199d46d3d,Arun K Nampoothiri
2,"Bru Bru Bru !
Har baar ke train ka saathi.
Tu na hota to train ka safar bahut dard ke saath gujarta. Station pe Marudhar ka intezaar aur room pe auto ka intezaar karte karte dosti kitni badh gayi kya batayein.
Agar tu na hota to train ke ajeebogareeb logon se baat karke dhyaan kaun hatata ? Mai upar waali seat pe chain ki nind kaise sota ?🤣.
Saath me kiya project aur tere windows ki rebooting ki har problem hamesha yaad rahegi ;)
Milenge dobara, kisi aur trip pe, sabke saath. Tab tak safe reh, khush reh vats ✋

3,"Itihaas gawah hai ki hostel me do bros jab mile hain to final year me alag hona hi pda. Shayad ye kudrat ka karishma tha ki college me entry bhi ek room me hui aur exit bhi ek hi room se.
Khair, kaafi philosophy pel di.
Konsa vichitra kaam nahi kiya ?Watercooler se cooler me paani bharkar bisleri ki bottle ko uske upar mujra karwaya. Shayad ye jaadu koi aur na jaanta ho.
Room ke andar sutli bomb aur kon fod sakta hai ? First year me HEC se chhupkar OAT ke piche garden me letkar wifi chalana, aur us excited kutte ka excitement control karna; Utsav ki bidai par vilaap karna; gaming karna aur last room ko theatre banane ka plan; Suman ka mms banana; Arun ka sleeping makeup karna....itna sab hai ki yaad nahi.
Phir milenge, tab yehi chizen to baad me yaad ayengi XD. 'interaction' ki vo raat jis din saari chitrakala baahar aayi thi chacha log ke saamne, jis din pole ka talent aur debate karne ki kalaa nikli thi hum logon me, aur jab Abhit ka chhipkali prem saamne aaya tha, vo din kabhi nahi bhulne waala. 
Milte hain dost, phir kuch kissa lekar, bakaiti ke naye kaarnaame lekar.
Bas ek hi ichhaa adhuri reh gayi, agar paani ki vo saari bottles bech di hoti to aaj 500 ke note se bane gadde ke upar baith ke ye likh raha hota :'-(",Prabhat Kumar Singh,True,60858136819323d199d46dc9,Ritik  Pankaj
4,"""Jo hota hai acche ke liye hota hai.""
I think of this when I remember that you missed the first quiz of the first semester of your college life. Painful, yes. But destiny.....
Whatsapp numbers exchanged, emergency contact method established, just to make sure none of us missed the next D-Day. That's where the formal friendship started.
I could say our friendship was like the apes starting to interact in order to start a new age of civilization. Ye le mere ghar ki mithai. Ye kachori rakh, Jodhpur special XD.
The real spark started with us buying Haralambos, mugging up shitty sociological theories and cursing the course with each term memorised.
I can't remember when you became the photographer of our group, always coming up with dazzling ones. Two OTC trips and an all cycle trip to the Barrage brought out the adventurer in us, knowing each other better, struggling and still finding the fun in that. Never losing the cool even in the greatest of pressures is something I borrowed from IITK, with you at the centre. 
After so many travels, there's one thing I know: the thirst for more adventure isn't over yet. 
Won't be long hopefully, when we'll be pulling our bags together, sneaking into one of the locals without a ticket, yet for another adventure....
Till then, adios friend, philosopher and guide'ish'",Prabhat Kumar Singh,True,60805a56819323d199d46d3e,Utsav  Akarshan
