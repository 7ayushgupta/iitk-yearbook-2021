0,"This guy, oh well! Believe it or not, you were one of those who had the most significant contribution to how I turned out. I think I'll try and say some things I haven't before. By the end of it, I want you to know that you're someone I have and will always value a LOT! 

We didn't meet at the cycle stand; it was in front of the Tutorial block while riding on our cycles. You came out of nowhere, and you said, ""mera naam woh hai jo campus mein sabse common hai,"" and I went, ""and mera naam second most common hai"" XD. However, we only ever started hanging out in the 2nd semester; I remember being amazed by how you managed to be so chilled out and still get dassa(s). That semester we hung out a lot, from CHEM lab to ESC lab to classes to the hall. 

Trip yaad hai? You and Nikunj, boy oh boy! You guys fought soooo much! The other thing, though, I don't know if you remember, but we went for a walk to that church on the Mall road in Shimla. The view was terrific, the weather perfect! Ek woh din tha when things were good, and Ek woh last day photoshoot/vibing in the room. That to say, we both know it wasn't exactly a smooth ride in the middle, and I am grateful I had you. There were some real lows, but yeah, thank you for getting me through them safe and sound. With you, sharing was easy. Somehow, it always lightened my heart to share, and that meant the world to me. Some of the best advice I got was from you, and more than once! The one about being indifferent rather than harboring hatred is my all-time favorite :p. But BC kitne jokes maare hai fir yeh sab pe tune sabke saamne, oof! Although, I never mind that, so it's cool.  

By the time I reach this part, I always wonder how I will ever stop writing if I kept going on. Memories rush in while I type this at 4 am in morning. Endless, countless memories. Random canteen visits, music jam sessions in your room, just hanging around. It is genuinely tricky to try and remember a time when I did not enjoy your company. I wonder if I can claim this for more than a handful in my life. Lockdown robbed us of more memories but honestly, seeing you in Goa after so long and still having that vibe between us was a relief. Omelet breakfast hi sahi, but it gave me the confidence that our friendship can survive long pauses. 
Anyway, at least the last days were fun, poker, guitar, and whatnot. It is only fair the last campus night out was with you. Bahut aage jaana hai bhai tumhe, the potential in you is unparalleled. I know you will. I hope to see you down the road somewhere and still have this friendship.  Thank you for everything then and forever.

Bhai kitna late mile hum, but these last few months have been super duper fun because of you. Such a great party guy! Beers to Gin to Weed shakes to spray painting to hanging out now in Chandigarh.

2,"Hey man!!

We got to know each other through MTH, but, I think over the years it became so much more than that. We might not have defining moments in out friendship, but, we do hung out randomly in different groups at different times. Vox was fun with you, editorial board mein woh banda who would be sceptical and critical of the right things! Goa was so fun with you, so are the random ""Instan't Eggs Benedict"" conversations. I will never forget the ""free fall kardunga"" moment though because damn! Even the getting high sessions in the last few months of college. 

I'm so happy to see you grow so much over the years, and I'm glad to have known you all this while. Hopefully aage bhi baatein hoti rahe and aise hi chaapte raho through life.",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60cf6b7b659165b3aa64669e,Aditya  Sonthalia

Man, I can never forget that happiness and smile that instantly had me. Little did I know, that was your constant state of affairs. Such a talented guy, we didn't get to hang out much in the later years but I have seen you all along. It was such a pleasure knowing you, keep up your enthu and skills for sports and stay happy!

I do have one complaint though, and it's not really your fault, but oh well. 

I'm just surprised you didn't mention that song, ""are you, are you coming to the tree"" in the memoir. By the way, thank you a ton for that. I needed that at the time, and you wouldn't know how much it helped. Ek cheez, I think you give me too much credit and yourself a little too little. You're such a cute, sensible human being, and it comes easy with you. Talking is easy with you; vibing is easy with you, and it shows in the kind of openness we have with each other.

You are one surprise little energy packet XD! Thanks a ton for bribing me to come to Goa (I am going to claim that beer, don't you worry!). I simply cannot forget the night when you guys had kulfi and you were high AF. Sonthalia even thought you were asleep but you were out and you called me ki Ayush mai kaha jaa rahi hun pata nahi, aaja 😂. It was raining and I found you near OAT, frolicking about alone. God, it was super fun. The other thing I will cherish is our little scooty ride in Goa, you were supposedly the slowest and people didn't wanna go with you XD. Yet we reached back ahead of a lot of people, we even raced Akshay at a point!!! I thought it was a great drive back with very pretty music that we blasted in the night. Then ofcourse us stopping for Hoegaarden and finding Kushagra there already. Goa was so much fun even when you were constantly interrupting our dark room game!

Thank you for always being my companion in the up and down, side to side, roller coaster ride of a journey we've had. Things are looking up for you bud and I know they were a long time in the making.

Is there a limit to your perseverance man? You were relentless in your persuasion for Instagram and Sapiens! I'm glad you got me into both of those though. You won! Meeting you in Electromania was such a chance and boy did we have our moments since then! One of the most versatile humans I am aware of. I am in awe of the brilliance a humility that accompanies it. We share a lot of things we can both obsess upon, and I'm thankful for it. Nikunj's senator manifesto is still the best piece of manifesto IITK has ever seen, and we really outdid everyone with that. Yayy us! I was super excited to know you got placed in MS and I couldn't think of anyone that deserved it more. It's such a shame to not get the chance to hang out, chill and vibe on stuff this last year. Hopefully, we can compensate for that in our love for F1! Verstappen ko abhi WDC jeetana hai!

I find it incredibly appropriate to send you your memoir on text after the deadline thing is over. Why you ask, because it has always been that way hasn't it? Us talking a ton on text after just meeting up! XD 
So look out for it, you'll have it soon enough. There's a lot to unfold, but as you correctly put it, we have seen each other grow, hate, love, fall and all that comes with a bundle of emotions.

21,"Alright! As promised, I'll start with you. I hope this thing has a word limit because it will be difficult to judge the point at which you'll stop reading and just call to ask what I have to say. Linear Algebra might've been the worst course that we had to endure, but it was also the one where we actually met for the first time. It was a strange yet perfect time for us to have become friends. Well, partly because that allowed you to steal Nutella on my birthday, but mostly because I needed someone to not judge me at the time. Somehow, I always felt safer with you. Sorry, I forgot your birthday that year, but I made up for it, so you cannot complain! You were the silver lining in my life when everything was bleak—someone who was always welcoming with a warm hug.

I still count our 4th semester as one of the best times I've had here, and it had a lot to do with you. From Psychology classes to TA lab shenanigans to binging Netflix to relishing our amazingly similar food tastes at god knows how many cafes to our 6 am walks (Trust me, I can't get up at 6!). The list never ends; we had good times. There are so many days where I recall you being in my corner, sometimes even going out of the line to support and stand up for me. The summer of 2019 will always be one of the highlights of our friendship; how I would look forward to us talking almost every day. I felt heard, and that is the best feeling there is. I don't think we had many differences at any point in time; however, we did get busy in our own different ways. Despite that, I'm glad that we've only grown closer and fonder with time. I hope our friendship is here to stay. 

Oh well, I think it's impossible to list all the million different reasons why you're an absolute gem of a person. Ugh, I wish I could say it all. I am proud of what you have achieved and in awe of the perseverance you possess. Also, It wouldn't kill to let the world see that you're a kind and sweet soul! But then, you know your worth. World is a mess right now, stay safe and stay healthy you moron! 

Anyway, just know that I have appreciated you every single day of our friendship. Aaah, I'll miss you a lot. Before I end this, I would like to apologise if I did you wrong intentionally or otherwise. Goes without saying that I’ll always be here for you, for better or for worse.

26,"Yaar mere liye toh Kushagra hi tha, inn logon ne bol-bol ke Kush ki aadat daal di XD. Anyway, I'll get to it now. You made writing this super tricky, man, as if it wasn't already. As I gear up to write, there it is again, that funny feeling. It isn't nostalgia; it's a cocktail of gratitude, appreciation, admiration, and love towards your being. Looking back to the Jaipur days, talking random shit outside the center, however unnecessary, was the seed of what would nurture into one of the most supportive branches of my IITK tree. Long story short, it cannot be stressed enough how much good you have done for me. I won't disrespect that by trying to assign words to it. You might have saved me at a time when I for sure did not have the strength to do it myself. I don't think I ever told you this, but this feels like an appropriate time to let the cat out of the bag. 

Whatever you do, you do it with such conviction. Consequently, your plans have exceptional clarity, and I am always somewhere following you along the road uphill. Although it has been a long road that led us here, I feel like there are so many aspects I am yet unaware of. A big part of you remains a mystery to me, but I am grateful for the sides I got to experience. You are so versatile and adaptive to the environment around you. No wonder you're a part of so many groups that are ideologically poles apart. You try to extract the most fun out of every situation without ever taking it your heart, and that is a quality a very select few possess. It is weird how fast you speak when you're passionate about the conversation, debating is scary with you at times! The speed at which your thoughts change is genuinely hard to grasp. 

That said, we found love in Stats together that saved us from Algebra's devil-ish grasps. Sharing nearly every MTH course, sitting side by side, understanding our way through it, right there and then was perhaps what made it look so easy. I don't think I would've done half as well as I did if not for us challenging each other for an explanation of even the minor intricacies we could find. Our veritas-style board was all I needed to be confident! You listed out almost all of the things that were unique to us, and here are some more: Researching the hell out of unsolvable problems,  obsessing over finding houses (you know whose XD), most useless bets (one of which got me into huge trouble, ugh!! Side note: Sorry for the behaviour that day though), the '90s themed photoshoot, weirdest pranks, and practical jokes, Hannibal! It was all super fun. And here's a list of things I couldn't have done without your help: that Chief-Ed presentation, every fucking step of the college grad applications, GSoC, My research work with Dootika ma'am, Medha (XD), Goa trip, life etc etc etc. I cannot thank you enough for all of these. Just know that I am forever indebted to you, and I owe it all to you. 

Honestly, I can't go on much longer with this, but know that it isn't the end. Finding 'Atleast 6' was one of the best things that happened to me; I'm glad we will always have that safe in the knowledge that it is here to stay. The creativity we have channeled in that group is unparalleled. You're incredibly creative when you put your mind to something. I need more music recommendations!! I've seen you achieve so much, and that is genuinely heartwarming to me; I feel like a part of it to a point where I cried my eyes out when I heard about your grad school acceptance in UW (then you outdid yourself, haha). 

Sorry for whenever I might have done you wrong or the parts where I couldn't do enough. Thank you for being a person I could trust and the one that helped me find trust in myself.

Lockdown robbed us of more memories but honestly, seeing you in Goa after so long and still having that vibe between us was a relief."" 

Yeh statement memoir copy karne ke liye nahi tha XD! Just genuinely yehi feel hota hai mujhe about us. Elections ka toh mention hi na kar, it was always a great feeling to see you win after me handing in my small contribution. Being team Nikunj ensured me a part in the winning team, so naturally it felt worth it. Even without it, you did deserve those things and I'm glad you came out on top. Rota bahut hai, but sab kuch jo sochta hai kar toh leta hi hai. Bahut aage badh gaya tu from us literally butchering every TA assignment to being at BCG. Still cannot forget your shenanigans in Delhi on our trip and the inhuman amount you can sleep!

I was once a big fan of your youtube channel (at a time when I was very active on youtube), great content man. Baaki toh aise hi chaapte raho, Danke fur everything.

Suna tu bhi Gurgaon aa raha hai? Man, from Jaipur to Kanpur to Gurgaon, the story continues. Jaipur mein toh tere jaise logon ke bina kya hi hota mera. Never got a chance to thank you enough for that. I've rarely seen someone as smart as you be as humble and down-to-earth as you are. It is one of the best things about you, always keep that up! 

Baaki Gurgaon aaye toh milna zaroor. All the best for the future, aise hi chaapte reh <3",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60afcdd3659165b3aa644e71,Sarthak  Singhal
38,"Yo Shobhit!

Aren't you one of the sweetest person on the campus; always ready to take a joke sportingly. I am glad to have known you for this short while. I love how humble and down-to-earth you are despite being no less talented than everybody else around. Tujhe aise randomly dekh ke hall mein/campus mein dil khush ho jaata tha, itne dhang se treat karta tha hamesha and hamesha Hi bolke jaata tha <3. Anyway, all the best for the future, keep up the hard work.

39,"Guten Tag, (an ode to the german class you never completed XD)

As pointed out, we met usse pehle bhi Antaragni mein, Pratigya introduced us there (seriously, why would I wish a random stranger!). To be honest, mujhe tu kabhi ""hamesha high"" nahi laga and that in your case is saying something!!! But but but, I have never met anyone else with the depth of logical explanations that you seemingly possess. You can bloody back up any and every action of yours with a perfectly reasonable sounding explanation. I love that about you. We did have great times together and I cannot deny how much I loved our super long conversations about the most random stuff. You're the best reddit buddy I know. I still remember that one comment of yours about a rare subreddit that got pretty famous and the whole coincidence around it. Your coat hanger was amazing man! I wish I had one too. Always had my eyes on yours though XD. It was pretty amazing seeing you towards the end, it felt good to connect with you again like we never got distanced. That's the stuff about our friendship, it'll never be affected while apart. Pratigya ke birthday ke gift pe likhe hue short 4 liner poems yaad hai? Cake girna toh yaad hoga hi XD! Shit just remembered, Vox ki freshers' video kitni amazing thi together. Shooting and editing. Remember the Wales joke? Here's more random stuff, Loved the way you fried ants inside your laptop, by the way. Hemant ko dhundhna that last party mein was so fun. We walked the skywalks of Hall-5 <3! I feel like with our friendship, life is a series of unrelated wacky adventures lol. 

Anyway, Thank you for the 3 am Chowpati visits with me. I just knew I would only find you at that ungodly hour ready for a snack and chat! A lot here will be left unsaid and I don't think I can do justice to everything with these words, so I prefer we talk it out in person. Just know that I have always found a really good friend in you and I want it to remain the same going forward. 

To all the good times and more, cheers!",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60cf82e0659165b3aa6467b4,Shreyash  Ravi

Aas paas ek hi MTH ka banda tha jiske saath padhne ke baad lagta tha haan kuch toh kar hi denge ab exam mein. Every revision session we had in your room or on your whiteboard made my life so much easier. Kitni zyaada mehnat karta hai bhai tu, har problem set ko multiple baar, it's weirdly encouraging. I'm glad the journey continues with Zomato! Pretty sure office mein milenge, mai toh anyway next year hi jaaunga! Tab tak aise hi chaapte raho.

41,"Hey Sidjay,

Thank you for you kind words on the FB goodbye post. You're such a determined guy, always burning the midnight oil on something! Pretty sure your ghost will haunt KD lab, helping the future students in need XD. I remember the German skit practice in NCL, it was super fun! 

All the best for your future man; pretty sure you will reach great heights!",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60afcc5b659165b3aa644e70,Siddharth  Jayashankar

43,"Psych!! Everybody lies!

I don't know about how we met, but, I for one, am sure you are the one of those who will stick forever. For the longest time, It blew my mind how content you were with life. I would always look for a way to grab a fraction of it for myself. But now, I've come to a happy realization that it's just what you have made of yourself—a consequence of your hard work and a testament to your will. You're the very definition of discipline and the epitome of things that one can achieve through it. That aside, you're a wonderful and joyous human being.

I can count back a box load of things that we have done/shared all this while. Psychology classes/assignments/projects with Devpriya sir, Vibing over House and Sherlock, Udaipur trips and treats, Our campus exploration tour that ended in free coffee at Flexi, staying at my home a bunch of times, walks, talking in the most cryptic ways, bowling trips in Kanpur. I wonder whether I shouldn't have told you who was stealing your door plants. Memoir would've been a fantastic place to reveal it. Honestly, it can't be enumerated. It feels like you've been a part of every other thing in my life. That says volumes about us. You're more than a friend; you're family. There isn't much more to say about it. 

I'm not going to lay down more of what we have done here. I'll leave that for us to reminisce over coffees in the future. Instead, I'll have you know that my respect and admiration for you is beyond anyone else. You always make me feel like I can talk to you about anything and at any time. I can always count on you that way. There are days I am at a loss for words, and today sure as hell feels like one. I don't know how we became such good friends, but I felt like we had a unique connection between us, unfazed by situations I fell into. 

You're super brilliant, and you excel at everything you do! I cannot wrap my brain around it. All this time together, yet you remain a mystery to me. I would have loved to know more, whatever more was there to learn. I wish you talked to me about things when they weren't right for you, as I did numerous times with you. Enjoy your incredible success; you have earned it. Know that I'm always around the corner (quite literally too XD!).  ",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60cf95a9659165b3aa6468cc,Yash  Baheti
44,"Yo Kuwade,

Generally apne saare interactions Vox mein hi hue, but those were incredible fun. From discussing latest gossip to ongoing gymkhana politics to pressing issues we needed to work upon. Remember that we also wrote our first Vox article together, ""Fresher's Fundae"". It was a pretty great moment at the time. I have always seen you as a dedicated hard-worker and I hope you reach great heights.

All the best and I hope we'll write something together again.",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60afca67659165b3aa644e6f,Yash  Kuwade
45,"Bhosdiwaale tum! Aadhi dosti toh tumne bahar hi rehke nikaal di. But then aren't these things always, ""I wish I could've known about the view from halfway down"" sort of things. I think no matter what I write down here, it'll mostly feel incomplete. From you always dragging me into your super weird girl schemes (delhi to antaragni to germany even ffs!) to I don't know the countless things we have shared all this while. You are one unstoppable work machine, seriously WTF! Kaise itna kar liya bc tumne. Tumhe toh mai aise role model ki tarah rakhta tha ki isko dekh ke kuch na kuch toh karlunga mai bhi life mein XD. I seriously hope it is not the end, cause there's a lot to be done here. Aaja bhai abhi delhi/Chandigarh chalte hai na kahi. I'm glad I rubbed my overspending habit on you although ab revert ho gayi hogi, but oh well. Kya hi bolun ab, kitni baar hi humne kitne hi cheezon pe bakchodi ki hogi. Pettiest things like Hemant ko high karne ki bet over a chocolate to serious stuff like being there for each other (read you being there for me). Yaad karte raha karo bhai, humne bhi bahut yaad kiya hai last year and a half (maybe bola na ho), it is always great with you. ",Ayush  Agarwal,True,60cf7ce2659165b3aa64675c,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
