Yaar... aapka memoir likhne baitha toh rona aa gya... itna kuch hai jo likhne ka mann hai but kaise likhein sab... aapke jitna aacha insaan nahi mila yaar kabhi aur hume nahi lagta ki kabhi bhi milega... yaar itna dedication and itna unconditional pyaar toh kabhi kisi ne nahi kiya... aur yaar aapke liye jaan haazir hai. Yaar Mishra ji aapke jitna chaapu aur sweet insaan koi nahi hai... aapne ek baar btaya tha ki ""hum"" bolne ka matlab kuch apna akele ka thodi hai... sab humara saath ka hai... aur aapke saath humesha itne apnapan lagta hai ki ye baat bilkul sach lagti hai. Ab toh yaar Kusu bhi Cali mein hee hai... aate milte raheinge yaar... hum toh hain bhi Aditya-Aditya bhai-bhai. Sab logon ke baare mein soch ke lagta hai ki ""isse miss kareinge""... aapke baare mein jab sochte hain aise lagta hai ""yaar aapse itna milein ki kabhi miss na karna padhe"".",Aditya  Gulati,True,60c11049659165b3aa64532c,Aditya  Mishra
1,"Yaar bro! You are truly the best person to be around... whatever be the setting... whatever be the mood... from academic discussions and making lectures to board games in astroclub and random movie nights, sab cheezon mein you are one of the first people that I wanted to call... I still remember NYO mein you almost tricked me into eat a dead bee... from my first and only debate to pclub ki coordiship ki eternity, I can't think of anyone jiske saath itna maaza aata ho... I am always in awe of how you maintain your uniqueness while seemingly blending in with any group of people... I really revere every single one of our talks... be it scheming a pclub conspiracy, planning MTH ke bachchon ke liye events or randomly discussing life... yaar, looking back, itni cheezein saath thi ki probably character limit hee cross ho jayegi (somethings so coincidental like Inter IIT ka same event and 308) but I am grateful ki I had you by my side... I can't imagine certain things kaise survive ho paati (ya ho gayi) but with you they became fun... And of course, I am looking forward to conquering Disneyland with you!",Aditya  Gulati,True,60b2ef50659165b3aa644edf,Kushagra  Gupta
2,"Waking up every Sunday to the conversation, 
""Iss hafte kuch kaam kiya kya?""
""Nahi, tumne?""
""Nahi... chal mai sir ko mail karta hoon""
It was really fun working together and abhi toh aur bhi kaafi kaam karna hai. Still in awe of suddenly itne chaapu ideas aa jaate hain tumhe. Milte raheinge (chahe papers co-author karke conferences pe hee :p). ",Aditya  Gulati,True,60b2f186659165b3aa644ee0,Sayak  Chakrabarti
3,"Bro!
Yaar astro mein saath kaam karne mein bohut maaza aaya. Jab bhi tum club enter karte the mahool ekdum se light ho jaata tha.  Saath mein lecture dena was a very nice experience and astro ki treats were also very fun. Baaki whenever I have had a gymkhana related query, I've approached you and tumne humesha bohut sweetly bta diya even if chair se unrelated ho <3. Baat karte raheinge and hopefully milne ka bhi mauka mile. Stay awesome!",Aditya  Gulati,True,60c108f9659165b3aa6452f9,Yash  Maheshwari
4,Yaar kahan se shuru kaaron... college ke 4 saal ke baad lagta nahi ki first 1.5 years tak hum baat nahi karte the jyada... Bohut maaza aaya yaar tumhare saath... TA202 ke time se hee... Pclub mein toh bohut maaza kiya hee... RM ki discussion and fir chickblast pe dinners... life hee fix ho gayi thi... Tumne bohut help bhi ki... uske liye thank you... you are one of the smartest people in our batch... milte raheinge yaar,Aditya  Gulati,True,60b5e923659165b3aa644f2b,Yugesh Ajit Kothari
