Yep the term is still valid after second year given the fact that I used to spend much more time in your room than I did in mine :P. Agar apne wing ka koi HR Kadim kehlaya jaa sakta hai toh voh tum ho. Kitne saare sports khelna (voh bhi dhang se aur kadr se khelna, unlike us buffoons :"")), dance, acads, coding, event management, bandi patana aur pata nhi kya kya tum ek saath sambhal lete ho. And knowing where exactly you come from, it never ceases to amaze how you manage to keep such a cool head every time and have an optimisitc outlook on things irrespective of the situation at hand. The constant efforts you put in to reach greater and greater heights are an unceasing source of inspiration for me.

Thanks for being at the receiving end of my rants during the SPO drives, exams, assignment deadlines and just simply every day rr. Thank you for not just listening to my rants but doing so with a broad and calming smile across your face.  Thanks for patiently tolerating me as your badminton teammate :). But I won't thank for you for the cool music playlists always being played in your room. Vanced ka credit tumko nhi milega :P.

Bas thoda khulke baat karna seekh le. Ain't no point in hiding ""secrets"" for 2 years when everyone else almost surely knows it :). And yes, start asserting yourself. Better to be a driver than to be a passive passenger in the ride called life. Also, College ke baad bhi room ki heirarchy maintained rehni chahiye :P.

College mein ek trip banti thi saath mein but nhi ho paayi... :(. Chalo ab college ke bahar hi sahi :). Aage bhi aise hi chaapta reh.

47,"Hey Gawd! Yes Gawd. That is what I've always referred to you and will be for the rest of my life. I first got to know about you during the branch change ritual. Keshav with 7 A*. I thought that you must be some high headed guy with pomp and air about him. And I have never been so glad to be proven this wrong.

Most people are usually humble only on certain occasions, some are on many occasions but you have always been humble on every occasion I have seen you. I am not going to elaborate on how freaking brilliant you are. That has pretty much been made clear by the other posts out here. But I will definitely point out on your work ethic. The only person I have seen to stay in the KD Lab day in and day out will do everything and anything possible in his capacity until his objective is complete. I have literally seen you completing assignments and coursework when you were dead sick. Your perspiration and kind nature have always been awe-inspiring for me.

My first close interaction with you was during our attempt at MSAIC 2K18 (how hilarious and juvenile were we XD). And then I had the fortune to work with you in so many course projects. Because of you, I could always lax a bit because at the end of the day ""Keshav hai na!? Haa bas toh ho jaayege"" (and I did exploit it a bit :P). So thank you for indulging me and letting me ride on the tsunami of your exceptional abilities.

Many people are great. But not anyone has the persona that you have. True greatness does not stem only from one's ability but from his nature. You are a living manifestation of what true greatness is like.

All the best for your life ahead man, both personal and professional, not that you need any in the first place (:

You even went out of your way to get me introduced to clubs like IGVC only because I said I was interested in trying out something new. Pata nhi kitni baar tumko spam kiya hoga maine apne resume aur applications review karwane ke liye aur interviews se pehle khud thanda karne ke liye. Especially jab ghar mein crises chal raha thaa you were always there as a rock for me to fall upon. I can't express how grateful I am to have you as a friend during my stay here.

The next sem I snooped into KD Lab only to find you sitting there. And I instantly vibed with you. CR7, tech, Football, MKBHD, Music, Famous food spots, memes among many other things. It was only gradually that I realise that your figure was much taller than these shared hobbies and interests.

If Keshav is Gawd, then you are nothing less than at least a Demigod. I'm using this because you will politely refuse the title of God for yourself :). I have always been fascinated by your organised and systematic approach to your goals, work, fun and things in general. You're work ethic and your dedication to your goals is impeccable.
I have literally seen you completing assignments and coursework when you have been dead sick. Your perspiration and kind nature have always been awe-inspiring for me.

DE Courses, ECO, Course projects and everything in acads, I could always come up to your seat whenever I was stuck in a problem or some code. Because of you, I could always lax a bit for course projects because you would only fret over it more than any other person at the end of the day and would work your ass off to complete it (and I did exploit it a bit :P).

And not just your brilliance or your hard work, you are one of the most humble guys I have met on campus and your journey from IITK to Oxford is a living manifestation of the culmination of your perspiration and the sacrifices you have made along the way.

I was really looking forward to hanging out with you but alas, covid messed it all up. But hey, that does not mean we can't hang out still? After all, all international flights pass through Delhi and a layover of a day or two won't harm anyone :P.

You have been a constant source of inspiration for me during my entire stay in campus. Heck, your perfect balance between acads, clubs and co-curriculars is exactly what I once dreamed of when I entered college and seeing you living that actual dream never ceased to fill me with motivation.

Well no :)

Sorry to disappoint you but I ain't gonna give you any closure. Because that's how precious your friendship means to me. While you did deviate a lot in your objectives from your first year to the last year (Quantum Physics and Stonks are poles apart! XD), you were on the constant hunt to search for that one thing that fulfilled you, and that's what separates you from the mainstream out there. Because people are usually content with what they have but you my friend are probably the only person I know at IITK who has dared to dream as big as being a Wall Street Banker. 

Thanks for letting me crash into your room, into your bed and into your DSLR :P. I guess almost every decent photo of mine has your magical hands and editing skills behind it. But I do give you PC every time so I guess we can call it even :P.

I am still not happy with you not being able to get Atif Aslam for Udgosh -.-
Utter Disappointment. Ughhh! Guess Karma is a bitch coz the entire Udgosh got cancelled. Hehe.

You're a great friend, bhai. Not everyone is as selfless as you. Heck, you are too selfless for your own good (YKWIM) and its high time you start asserting yourself and valuing yourself as much as I and people around value you. You are important. Never forget that. Thanks for introducing me to all sorts of English Classic Songs and making me fall in love with them again. Thank you for always being there for me to vent out my every rr and not only listening to it with jaw-dropping patience but also providing me with valuable feedback. Thank you for error checking my resumes and applications and what not innumerable times (Anyone else would have already kicked me out of their room by then :P).

At the end of the day, you did manage to bag what you chased after professionally. Sure there were hiccups along the way (and some major ones at that) but you never gave up. You tried again and again and again and are nothing but a living manifestation that hard work beats talent when talent does beat hard work.

All the best for your life ahead bhai, both personal and professional. I ain't letting go of you anytime soon since I need way too many great pics needed to be clicked for myself :P.
