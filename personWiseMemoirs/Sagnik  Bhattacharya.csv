0,"….And aaj maine apna yearbook dekha ❤️… so first year was all about “Aditya WiFi on karde mujhe magaai karna hai” …second year was all about internship and data structured classes XD, third year was about career discussions and fourth was about COVID…well no, first was about getting to know this person jo humesha class se direct C305 aake baithta hai(u even told one of your friends your room is C305 lmao), second year was all about that 2019 summer when we spent endless hours at either ours or Saksham’s rooms taking “preparation” and cracking dirty jokes… third was about seeing you mature up …that transformation from “is internship mein mazaa nahi aayega” to “main almost sure tha offer aa jayega”…until the shit of a pandemic separated us… well, be the amazing “bhosdiwaala” (Mihir’s words) that u are …. And we are gonna fucking stay connected whether you like it or not….lots of love ❤️❤️",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60a7a0ab819323d199d49281,Aditya  Gupta
1,"The idiosyncrasies of mine were put to use on you the very first week we quite fortuitously met, and thanks to your innocence they did but exacerbate the situation. To a great extent it produced the sensation of mirth, and my fastidiousness towards being didactic ""by scandalizing"" of course. It was in the months that followed that I discovered your diffidence, and your helpful nature rendered our initial exchanges ephemeral. It did span out to involving discussions at the Hall 5 Canteen over my upcoming B grades or the মনিকা situation, when your confession ""of not being able to sleep one whole night"" proved totally iconoclastic to the presumption of your nerdiness. Well, things did flow smoothly since then, with Microcap discussions or lab report exchanges, and it was very slow and natural for me to value the bond we developed as a capricious one. Believe you me, you were someone I always knew I could bank on, and so I did hours before EC lab exam, and still Mazhari f**ked me over with wave-shaping. Occasional discussions of astrophysics and dark matter, more lab report exchanges, my B grades and how I'd rue the day I joined IITK, and a caring friendly ear provided by you, did make up for one hell of a ride! Hope we meet soon!! ",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,False,60c2b3b0659165b3aa64619b,Debmalya  Sarkar
2,"I remember me checking out your profile on fb since you were cute, and then feeling awkward when you asked me if I was Sagnik at dinner one evening. You were just as sweet natured, and we started talking here and there on various stuff. You used to accompany me in L20 first row at times, and boy was it a relief, discussing elections and plans and everything but the ongoing lecture. Thanks for the cycle rides, I was downright lazy and you played the role of a good savior. I remember us attending the Counselling Service Mental health lecture in Summer 2019, and I was surprised to discover that you had a spiritual and moral side, since I was very new to that stuff. You were one of the first persons to assure me that our friendship would not change in any way after my coming out, and that I was very brave to do so. Believe you me, that was exactly the words that kept me going in my moments of stress or insecurity. I wish we could spend more time but the ""China virus"" (: dOnalD trumP) happened, so here we are. We would be in touch and I hope to meet you real soon!! All the best for your future!!",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60cf6697659165b3aa64666e,Ratnesh  Argal
3,"Thanks for the immense patience you and Pulku showed me those first few months when I came up with innovative ways to send people out… and also putting up with my “daddy” issues…kidding aside, you always amazed me with your humility , and when everyone would leave my side or stay angry, I knew i could always rely on you; you are one of the most fun roomies one can hope for, and seeing you perform so elegantly on that “Antaragni Nukkad “ stage in your first year gave me so much pride… well that, has always been your talent, and your field now; may you reach new heights of success, and we will stay connected throughout( u don’t get a say in that) …lots of love Roomie ❤️❤️",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60a79f22819323d199d4927f,Rishabh  Ramola
4,"…And I write after you already gave me an earful on messenger…to be honest I gave the content much thought… and thought of coming up with something unique… failed ceremoniously… and am “back to basics” as you put it… despite whatever fights we have had… I can say without a shred of doubt that you are my best friend at IITK, and a real weird one at that….so, if I walk down that “memory lane” which we so serendipitously took the resolve to always tread together… all that comes to mind is the first day when those shitty seniors made us sit on the floor …. There I remember saying to you “ami sagnik Mukherjee bole ekjon achhe jantam and tor face ta chintam but didn’t correlate”…and u did that very stupid “mama” waala expression (don’t do that it creeps me out till date)… fast forwarding to our endless magaai at CC before the first semester exams….down to the different excuses you made to Pushkar before locking the door so that I could cry about feeling homesick… to the first trip home we took together and my WhatsApp ploys on “Oder dujon ke amader lower berth gulo dibina” (and you violating that , always being the good guy)… to our first dramatic fallout because of Ornob reasons XD … to our pathways getting slowly separated because of our interest areas, yet still hitting new “highs” of magaai the night before TA202… to our second dramatic fallout because of what I don’t remember…. to the days of you coming into my room moment after my coming out article was published, saying “aagun lagiye dili toh”…. to the tense days of the internship season… and to our third fallout from which we didn’t recover soon enough…. I did write you that letter, in my defence, you didn’t write back until COVID came😒…. And then…then it was just COVID … so here I am, looking at my masterful recollection of our “cute” moments, laughing in glee and thinking of staying connected throughout life by or against your wishes, thinking what I wrote was a real tearjerker ❤️❤️",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60a79d41819323d199d4927d,Sagnik  Mukherjee
5,"So there's my PHY101 partner whose life I started making miserable right from Semester 1. And despite your account of our journey being pedantically correct, I am gonna adhere to the fact that we had one hell of a ride. Tbh all of that meticulous data collection amounted to nothing, I didn't even manage an A in that piece of shit course, but it was an all but pervasive experience for us getting to know each other. You were sweet and polite, and I'd like to believe we made a good team, for we had Rinzin and Ramjas in front of us and their joint endeavour put our spirits right up the alley. You have been a good friend and a source of support during me venting out my frustration about many of my courses, thanks for always listening to my rant with a smile.
ENG123 -with the course name itself being funny, I did rue the day I signed up for it. You were such a peaceful sight, amidst all the Freudians and over-analyzers sitting there just for those 5 marks of class participation. I believe the way our friendship developed is more of a symbiotic ""being there for one another"", and that is but the most organic of ways. 
We would be in touch (by or against your wish) and I hope to meet you sooooon. All the best for your future, bud!",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60cf6483659165b3aa646660,Sajal  Chaurasia
6,"It's a shame to have to write a memoir to express the plethora of stuff we have gone through together, but here goes. It all started out with this ""A4 sheet for TA101"" discussion, you were an introvert cute guy back then. Then it went on to become those red sauce pasta breaks during the first semester exams and we bonded over food and gossiping about some people behind their backs, which might have been the main focus of my time at IITK. Then you abruptly became the FIFA boy and our pasta breaks were cute short by Pulkit forcefully (as always) entering your life with his (poor) FIFA skills. We discussed courses and Pulkit, and I always had the vibe of a good human being coming from you, but you did something by saving me from that third semester incident that I had never expected. I started respecting you as a person with high integrity, and that as it comes by, is rare. Then you became the face of E-Cell, and did a fantastic job at it, which more than one achievement coming your way (double meaning intended). I miss our EE340 tutorials, were we always took the last row and discussed useless topics of gossip. I wish we could spend more time, but I do believe I have gotten to know you a lot; would like to keep in touch, and hope to meet you soon. All the best for your future!!",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,False,60cf6998659165b3aa646685,Saksham  Gupta
7,"Seldom do people think that you can take something as ""cute"" as ""hailing from Malaysia"" and turn it into something offensive, but well, some of our eccentric wingmates taught us that. I remember our first conversation to be the one about me wanting to go to sleep early xd. You did respect privacy of people, and were one of the few who understood what was offensive and what wasn't. During a particular time when majority of the wing disliked me, you were one of the very few who I could confide in without the feeling of my words becoming public knowledge once I left. You have always been polite and sweet to me, and that in itself seemed such a rarety among the people we were surrounded with. Our conversations were sudden and interesting, from the censored parts of Anne Frank's diary to the you clicking pictures of me doing my favorite course TA101 during Antaragni, it was such a colorful journey we had. I wish I could be there for you when you were going through a tough phase emotionally, but I got the knowledge of that much later, although I should have checked in on you more often. You have waded past that phase with much strength, avoided toxicity without delving in it, and I believe that has made you wiser. I wish we could spend a lot more time but the ""China Virus"" (two offensive country jokes in one memoir xd) happened, so here we are. I would love to be in touch with you, and hope to meet you real soon. All the best for your future, bud!",Sagnik  Bhattacharya,True,60cf7114659165b3aa6466c6,Shreyash  Ravi
