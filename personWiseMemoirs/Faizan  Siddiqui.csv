Yaar first-year new year waale din darr se zyada teri insta live par fatti hui dekh kar mazza aa raha tha, but seriously that aalu ke truck ke upar waali ride is always going to stay as one of the most precious memories of college. Then Shimla trip even after all the ladai was amazing, especially narkanda wala spot and kaise mai free me tere saath AC2 me travel kiya tha XD. Bangalore me tujhe zabardasti Anabelle dikhane ke liye sorry, but tujhe jana nahi chahiye tha. Bohot saari aur scooty rides and pubs visit karne the! Even though last month's campus stay went down in the worst possible way, I honestly enjoyed all the time we spent and got high together. You are the funniest guy I have ever met and a great friend. Take care man, and don’t be a stranger.",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60ce95fb659165b3aa6464c7,Aakarsh  Singh

2,"Sonthalia bro, you are an amazing person with the jolliest personality. Carrying bhand you out of GH has been one of the most thrilling tasks I have done on campus. Bhai sign-out karate time kya fatt rahi thi XD. I am so sorry for the scarring maggi waali memory. Talking to you at CCD to watching hindi cartoons after bong in Hall 9, the journey has gone high (see the pun) each day. I am sure tu GS me aage zindagi me chaapta rahega. Stay the same!

3,"College life straight up won’t have been fun without you. From library me padhne ki koshish in the first sem to full out bhand periods in the final, I found the most trustworthy and reliable friend anyone could have. I guess you were the first person I talked to in college while we stood together waiting in the hall office queue. I still remember Maulik ne tere se kya mast catwalk karai thi library me XD. And teri cycle par kaise dande par baith ke ride of shame karte the raat me XD XD. Winters me that bithoor trip with you and Avisha was amazing and I hope kisi din using some high tech detector we find your lost specs there. Thanks to you, I had the b’day cake, which will definitely be a fantastic conversation starter for me. Bhai agar us din wo fatt jata to best ka to nahi pata par last b’day zarur hota XD. Although hamlog ne dance me kaafi haga tha, but didi ki shaadi was terrific! And then our new year celebration and Goa trip ki awesomeness to undefinable hai. 
I know we have had our ups and downs, and I haven’t always been the best of friends, but everything bhand Faizan said about you in Goa meant it. Stay the same bubbly and khurafaati person you are, no matter what anyone says.",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60bff1f6659165b3aa645153,Akshay
4,"Madam Anono! From the first hi at OAT in the first sem to the last good bye hug on the last day of college, you have been one of the most important person to me on campus. Thanks for being the one who has always heard me out and made MSE bearable for me through the years. Agar tu na hoti to mai pakka aaj 3-4 backs ke saath extended degree student hota  XD. I still don’t understand how Anandh sir gave you the sleeping lady title while I was always the one sleeping in the class next to you. Chai at CCD ke bagal waali canteen in between classes is unbeatable even after the fact that we got thrown out of the class for that. Well, you still owe me 500 rupees + interest for the PSO waali bet. 
For a fact I know ki tu aage zindagi me bohot chaapti rahegi and notes chhaap ke mujhe gifts bhijwaegi :P. Always keep in mind the things bhand Faizan told you on the last day of the Goa trip. Stay the amazing and strong girl that you are. Love, Faizan",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60befdc9659165b3aa64507e,Ananya  Goswami
5,"Yo ex-roomie! I can never forget our maggi wala horrific moment; never trust a high guy with food XD. “Bhaiyya isko ek (do) goli waali special kulfi”. Kya gullible hai tu XD. “Tum log ko aisa lag raha hoga ki mai bhand hoon (hand actions being the most important part), lekin mai bhand nahi hoon”. After saying this n times, “Shayad mai kaafi bhand hoon”. I guess a lot of years down the line, we’ll still be laughing like crazy over your freshers wala dance. From banging your door and ‘disturbing’ you to spending all day together at the worst airport ever, you have been a very special friend. ICSE English for life <3",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60cc1ba0659165b3aa646363,Anshika  Verma
6,"Kaiii brooo! I remember Animesh mentioning you so many times in the FMC room that I got super intrigued ki kaun hai ye banda. Then when I finally met you and saw your amazing cinemat sense, the hype made so much sense. We’ve been together through those depressing PHY103 and MTH102 moments, discussing ki kiske zyada kamm aae. I seriously wonder how we completed these 4 years XD. CHM -> MSE <3. And how can we ever forget that new year waali aalu truck ride; “Jitna chale hain bas utna hi aur aage hai” XD XD. We’ll definitely always recall that moment as one of our craziest first year stories.
Thank you for always being the best listener and a fantastic friend. Aise hi zindagi me chaapte raho and keep making your awesome youtube videos. CCD ke bagal waali canteen for life <3",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60bfcd7e659165b3aa645137,Arun K Nampoothiri
7,"“Tu bhi comfest aaya tha? Tu bhi robowars me tha? Tu bhi us saal haara tha?” XD. Kisne socha hoga ki us din mai apne Shainiii Boiii se indirectly milunga. Bro you have been through all my ups and downs of life starting from the first sem, and ab you feel like a part of my family. First years winters with team robowars were one of the best moments of my college life. Kaise pagalo ki tarah din raat roboclub me kaata tha hamne and aadhi neend me nut and bolt tight karte the XD. I honestly wonder how none of us got injured back then XD. From sleeping on mechatronic lab ki table to having the deepest psychological discussions, we have come a long way.
You are one of the most genuine people I have met on campus, so please stay the same jolly and crazy person with the ability to analyze serious situations when needed. I firmly believe that you’ll become an amazing entrepreneur in life, and then I won’t need to work anymore :P. Lots of Love, Taxxiiid",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60bd51e7659165b3aa645044,Abhishek  Saini
8,"God Dr. Pal! Bro, you are the most hardworking person I have met on campus. I loved the way you had your goals set from the start of college, and you did achieve it all. I remember the time jab teri b’day oar GPL li ja rahi thi and tu uchak uchak ke bach raha tha XD and the time jab Shashank ko tune sote hue kya mast chappal maar kar jagaya tha XD. I always loved to have discussions with you hope to have more in the future. Aisai chaapte raho and I hope we meet in the US.",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60ce9ea7659165b3aa6464d2,Avik  Pal
9,"“Dadi teri morni ko mor le gaye”. That video shouldn’t have been deleted :P. I am pretty sure mere aadhe dost tere through hi kisi na kisi tarah se bane hain, so super glad that we met in ART105. That bithoor trip was one of the major highlights of the first year, and sahi me meri aakhen band thi us picture me XD. Always gonna remember your merlion puke in GH. I honestly miss our random CCD sessions where we used to catch up and bitch about people (you know who XD). You are one of the most amazing friends I have made on campus, so always stay the way you are. Love, your brother.",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60c00096659165b3aa645156,Avisha

12,"“Chaar saal me kabhi mai Dishaa se baat nahi karunga” XD. Yeah, well, life is ironic, isn’t it? Sometimes the most unexpected things in life are the best, and I found my best with you. I’ll thank rum and the lack of specs for introducing this amazing friend to me, a friend who has been the craziest celebrator of my success and the most comforting shoulder to cry on. I can never forget kaise tune mujhe ESC201 ke exam ke ek din pehle 14 ghante forcefully padaya tha. Thanks to you, I passed the course and somehow tere se zyada marks aa gaye. Hehe XD. I could only wish to have met you sooner, logo ko judge karna thoda jaldi seekh jata, an essential skill I lacked before :p (still learning tho). Please learn to walk straight and always do cute and clumsy harkate. From late-night walks on campus to driving around on scooty in Bangalore and Goa, this ride has been amazing by your side, and I wish to get the opportunity to hold your hands in the future as well. Take care, Biryani Monster. Stay smart, strong, and silly always. See you, Love you, Faizan",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60a7d3df819323d199d492cd,Dishaa  Rajora
13,"Hello fraudy club coordi, ab tak to it must have been quite clear that you are my best frenemy. I still remember tune kitni zabardasti ki thi NFS me ghusne ki and theek hai we now accept you as a part of our group, but that doesn’t change the fact that you’ll always be our roast topic XD. Tere kitne drame jhele hain maine yaar. Itni chhoti chhoti baat par kaun gussa hota hai be. Jitni baar tujhe chocolate deke bribe kiya hai, usko kahin invest kar deta to abhi tak ameer ho gaya hota.
On a serious note, thank you for being such an amazing listener. Tu na hoti to mera rona kaun sunta <3. Bangalore would have been amazing with you, par koi ni USA aa jana apan road trip karenge. Also, how can I write your memoir without mentioning that it’s an honor to be friends with the HOTTEST GIRL OF IITK (for others: haan ye sarcasm hai with some back story XD). From ruining your pochha to our daily superbhaats, this has been an amazing ride with you, and I know our tom and jerry friendship will stay forever. Regards, a fellow fraudy.",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60bd2b7c659165b3aa64503b,Inshu  Namdev
14,"Yo Niktik boiii! First year would have been incomplete without you and team robowars. Canteen me jaakar Saini ke naam par bill phadna, team up karke inshu ka roast karna, team Vision ke kuchh unsaid members ki bitching karna XD, ek dusre se rant karke zindagi ka frustration nikalna, manali trip ke kaands XD XD, ye sab chhote chhote moments bohot yaad aaenge. 
You are one of the people I appreciate the most for the amount of work you do and how seriously you take your interests in robotics. I firmly believe that you’ll excel in life and end up doing great things. Bas thoda chill bhi karo zindagi me, itna load na le :P.",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60bebc23659165b3aa645076,Nitik  Jain
15,"I still recall finding my name at the bottom of the jee experts test ranking and your name at the top. Having never actually talked to you, I had heard so many things like how you had a fixed seat, and if anyone sat there, you’d get them thrown to the back XD. Then in college, I remember our brief conversations at CCD and getting to know that you already know about all my embarrassing moments, thanks to Avisha XD. I honestly wish to have interacted more with you even before our lottery VH parties. Stay the chaapu girl you have always been, and our US road-trip plan is still on. Achha chal ab gossip bata :P",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,60ce7cb2659165b3aa64649c,Priya  Mishra
16,"To the future millionaire YouTuber who will buy penthouses for all his friends XD. I still remember the first-year Galaxy when the HEC introduced me to the hall ki jaan, and everyone was like, ""tum Ramola ko kaise nahi jaante"". You are an amazing person with a heart of gold, and not a lot of people manage to have such a charismatic personality with a humble nature like yours. Stay the way you are always, and keep making amazing videos. Your fan, Faizan <3",Faizan  Siddiqui,True,608ef1a1819323d199d47719,Rishabh  Ramola
17,"My first encounter with you was shayad the freshers' music club audition. I remember sitting behind you nervously and then listening to your amazing voice; I thought to myself, I need to get out of here before I embarrass myself XD. ART105 me approaching you girls was sachi not my plan, but after that, I remember a lot of guys begging us to take them in our group. It was terrific getting actually to talk to you during our lottery VH parties. And haan voyeurism nahi karuna, don’t wanna get kicked out of the US. Stay the same chaapu girl you have always been, and I hope you get you know who’s mail on your MIT mail id; keep me updated on that XD. Our US road trip is still on!
