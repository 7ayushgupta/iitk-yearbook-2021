2,"Right from my first year, i couldn't place you anywhere in my understanding of a person. Thankfully that puzzled of in the end but man, was it exciting around you. Not the normie fun but something with more substance. Something my brain fucking loved. The wild viewpoints and observation, to ask the fun stuff. Gotta miss that man. Meet you in us now. Till then! Bubbye! ",Hemant  Kejriwal,True,60cf8acc659165b3aa646884,Aman  Saraf
3,"I always remember that gorgeous new year's night, that's probably my best in life yet. Such ease and fun it was! And those frequent walks around the campus, I'll always cherish that! Ooh and the taxing intern day went so smoother for us as we had each other! Beautiful times those!

Well times change and now it's different. But it's alright I think. We'll find a balance. I'm sorry I've been an unreliable friend, I'll do better, promise. Can't believe how much we've grown up and matured with the time, now creating our own unique careers. Let's make the path converge every few years. Until then, take care and be the caring person you've always been!",Hemant  Kejriwal,True,60cf7394659165b3aa6466da,Ananya  Goswami
4,"I still remember you were the talk of legends back in our 1st year! The eternally sleeping yet 9.8 pointer mahician! Met you here and there, debating, antaragni and all, and had no idea the dissonance you were going through.

I'm glad you found something closer to what you wanted with life, even though you were already good at something lucrative! Milte hai kabhi, hopefully before alum meet, nahi to phir tu bude uncle ki tarah gyan dega. Till then, bye! ",Hemant  Kejriwal,True,60cf81b3659165b3aa6467a5,Anirudh Anil Ojha

10,"First of all, you made a bro proud with that bio 🔥

CS was a great time, all that brainstorming, where we couldn't agree on anything, the wine day(yes I remember every one of ours back story and I'm humbledby it), the outings, and ooh, the picnic 😅, and how would it ever been that without all our(and Sagnik's mostly) inappropriate jokes!

Although I wish I could reverse the mistakes and misunderstandings, it is what it is and ig it was a worthy experience on it's own. You know on that cbg day after avisha posted that story I suddenly realised fuck.and she checked the views and you were there. Never have I been more scared of you xd. And they say the rest is history

Hey you still owe me that walk someday, it's on you to arrange that okay? Till then, have a great time dost. bubbye!",Hemant  Kejriwal,True,60cf8085659165b3aa646792,Priyal  Bhandari

12,"First saw you whenI was with Akshay, cycling through acad area, going to L16 from that thin road by the wall. Baapre you talked a lot.

For all the ups and downs in the 4 years, and that is to say a LOT, it's been great to have you around! Movies, walks, outings, and ofc that candid day at RM, you're always filled with amazing stories!

It's been amazing to see you hold strong when many would buckle under the pressure, strong and bold. We are going our different ways, but I know we'll always be in touch and meet soon enough, hopefully in campus even! See ya! ",Hemant  Kejriwal,True,60cf7207659165b3aa6466cc,Avisha

17,"We should have met earlir right! I remember you from 3 years back in CS201 as the person who asked precise doubts, and that I admired. Quarantine would have been a whole other level of hell without you to chill out with. Those days felt like the beginning of college all over, with the terrace time, and the ball playing.

Those really were the days nai! Always counted on your ease and upbeat nature. And you often seemed to have a controversial ties of stuff. It's so refreshing! I'm so proud I made you read stormlight XD. You seem like a cross btw nature of lopen and thinking of jasnah. And thanks for always being someone I can rely on and be sure will understand instead of judging. Hopefully we'll meet next year in US.

Apun stock the stock kiye the 2nd year that was a neat day, and finally tera bhand and sad stereotype break hua mere mind me. Tabse toh, it's been amazing having heated convos and debates about stuff. Love how you have such an interesting perspective on things and such clarity in thoughts! That ESC ka grade cutoffwala incident is going to be the best practical joke of my college XD.
