Tere liye dil se respect nikalti hain. Mujhe aaj bhi Pizza Hut vala lunch yaad hain jab hum pehli baar campus se ghar jaa rhe they midsem break ke liye. Station pe bhi kaafi der tak tere sath bakchodi kari jab teri train late hogayi thi, tabse tere sath ek connection ban gaya tha. 
Campus main chaapu banna bohot log sikhate hain, but tunhe ek accha insaan banna sikhaya, jo shayad puri life sath rahega.

2,"Hello!!
I feel so lucky to have met you, Shreyash, Pratigya and Pragya during Antaragni of 2017 and receive the best friend circle I could have asked for! From pranking Shreyash on April Fools Day to celebrating almost every birthday together, I can't imagine having such a wholesome college life without you. You and Vatsalya were the first people with whom I would share any major life achievements. Also, I don't think anyone apart from you could have convinced me to dance :-P  -  Silent DJ will always be a memory that I will keep dear to me. I'll miss discussing random The Office episodes and never losing an opportunity to say ""Thats what she said"" in every conversation possible. 

Hoping that we can do more trips like Udaipur in the future 
Pls give my regards to Jaya Singhvi, Sheila Chaudhary road

I think pehli baar ICG winter project ke liye mille they, and I knew it then that we will hit it off! You are one of the most hardworking, smart and talented people that I have met in campus. I remember ek baar ICG project report ke liye KD computer lab main nightout maara tha, and tunhe mujhe motivated rakha tha to complete the work. 
I have always looked up to you for motivation and working hard. AnC was lucky to have you, tujhse better GenSec shayad hi IITK ki history main kabhi aaya ho. 
Baaki bakchodi bhi bohot kaati hain humne - Goa trip was epic thanks to you. Gurgaon main milte rahenge, sath main gedi maarne challenge, with Punjabi music (read Vol 1) on full volume.

Jab bhi koi doubt hota tha tere room bhag ke chale jaata tha, bina soche ki tunhe woh course kiya hain ki nahi. Mujhe pura confidence tha ki tu sahi rasta dikhayega, and tunhe har course main bohot zyada help ki. Thank you so much, bhai, for always being there for me and helping me with the silliest doubts. 

Love you lots bhai, and thank you soooooo much.

I have felt closest to you and Vatsalya on campus, and I have always considered you more like a brother and less like a friend. From enjoying Pronights together in Antaragni 2017 to participating in the Samsung Awards in my first year, I can't imagine having such a fun-filled and fulfilling first year without you. You were always there for me and helped me with all my personal as well as professional problems. Thank you so much for making all my birthdays in campus special by throwing such amazing parties and always being present when I needed you.
Also, thank you so much for hosting all of us during Eid and serving delicious food (Special thanks to aunty for making Veg Biryani :-P)

Bhai teri vajeh se I felt lucky and blessed to have got a branch change in Aero. CPI jaisi bhi aayi, but AE main maaze bohot zyada aaye thanks to you. Last day jab tu room aaya tab kaafi emotional hogaya tha, isiliye bol nahi paaya, but will miss you a lot. 
I have passed most of my AE courses thanks to you, graduation credits main sabse upar tera naam ayega XD.
Milte rahenge, apna US trip ka plan abhi bhi On hain. Plus Chennai se to tera ghar zyada dur nahi :-P

From starting No Chudyap Gang to random bakchodiyan during Aero classes, I can always remember myself smiling in all the conversations we've had. Also, thank you soooo much for helping me with all my silly Aero doubts - I will always be grateful to you and Harish for helping me pass all AE courses. Navrose sir ke course main bachane ke liye thanks - I would have definitely failed that course had it not been for you. 

You're one of the most jovial people I have met on campus, and you have a knack for making anyone smile :)

You are the first person I met outside my wing in Campus, and the last person I met (outside my wing) before leaving campus for Home. Almost all major fun events and bakchodiya that I have done in the campus have been with you - from crazy Antaragni nights to first college trip. Holi bhi sath hi main manayi thi XD
Dharamsala and Udaipur have been the highlights of my college life, and both of these trips were with you.
Lets plan the next trip asap!!

My book buddy - I always look forward to having meaningful conversations with you. I feel super lucky to know a fellow book lover like you who's always so passionate about discussing literature. I have had some of my most thought-provoking and intellectual discussions on campus with you, and I will always cherish those conversations. 
Your drive to pursue entrepreneurship is admirable, and I hope that you get to pursue it someday.
