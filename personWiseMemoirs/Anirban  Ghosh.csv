Learned a lot of things from you since my first year, and you still inspire me to try to run after excellence and how to be an ideal student.  First year me there room me bulla kaatna, padhai ki baate krna, gaana gana, loco khelna, politics ki baate krna ye kaafi fond memories hain. Uske baad wing tootne ke baad interaction km ho gyi but still kaafi baate hoti rehti thi. To me you'll always be a person who is not at all startled by the success hi gets and pursues excellence and not success, cuz success excellence ke peeche jhak maarke aa jaati and you are an example of that. Cheers bhai...aane waale dino me kaafi naam kroge ye hume poora bharosa hain tumpe.",Anirban  Ghosh,True,607e61b3819323d199d46b72,Abhyuday  Pandey

Kafi mast memories hain saath me, like quiz se pehle raat ko aake pucchna konsa part padhna hain aur saath me doubts clear krna...control lab ki submissions, MT aur Southern labs ka chai samosa in 6th sem.

First sem me yaad ho toh kaafi baar ECO101 me saath me baithte the..me being sleepy and getting bored and you listening it with attention, cuz tujhe economics mast samajh aati thi. Moving on to 2nd year, Chemical ke courses me saath baithkr mje kiye Ankit ke saath. Also humara TA202A ka pochha machine toh yaad hi hoga tujhe, jo mast pochha lgaya humara evaluation time pe. Fir tu Hall 2 presi bn gya...kaafi busy ho gye, pr apni bonding chemical ne bnayi rkhi ifywim. Kaafi mast insaan ho tum honestly, with good leadership skills. Kaafi mast experience tha tere saath TA me kaam krne ka. Aur fir apne chemical ke courses ke baate toh hai hi. Thoda khush ho jaata agar tu yaar khudse thoda chemical padh leta (I know you hate and fear it to the bones). But, I do feel great that I am great friends with the President of Hall 2.

14,"Most humble and ethical man I have seen in my IITK life. Got to know you from 3rd year majorly and then when we both converted to Dual, dosti gehri bn gyi. I remember how you pushed me to solve Thermo problems in detail cuz tu exam see pehle puchhega and then bta nhi paaya toh khudko bura lgega. Indirectly you have made me a better student in terms of solving more problems and doing more practice before exams to prevent mistakes. Also I expect tu aage rona dhona thoda km krega and I sincerely want you to continue being an ethical (which is very hard in these times honestly) and morally sound person that you are.

Aur saath me intern ke time test dene jaana aur fir katwakr aa jaana we have come a long way from that.

In beginning I used to find you rude and somewhat arrogant since tu itna zor zor ka Haryanvi gaana bajata tha aur zor zor se bulla maarta tha...but by 3rd year I had grown fond of you and had respect for your attitude and behaviour. And thanks to you kaafi cheezo ka exposure mila tumhari sangat me (ifywim :) ). Abhi ek saal baaki hai (since tu bhi ab Matka me bhi Matka lol), usme pehle jo masti na kr ske tumhare saath wo krenge.

Tumhara Mess Secy ka campaigning and fir election jeetkr Mess secy bnna. You were the best Mess secy in the 3 years of our stay in Hall 12. And then studying ESO208 together aur assignments jo tu mera use krta tha. But, on an honest note, you are one of the people whom I have seen grow to an awesome personality, and as you have said in your bio, kaafi optimized life jiye ho iss 4 saal me, something which many fail to do. Bss yhi dukh reh gya ki wapis mil nhi paaye since pandemic and we have lost touch since tum kaafi busy ho gye gymkhana aur drams ke responsibilities me, and also wing bhi alag ho gyi thi.

I know that apni bhut zyaada baate nhi hui, pr jitne bhi hui, kaafi acha lga. Politics ki baate, ESO205 ke assignments (11 bje hota tha tu aata tha room pr discuss krne 9-10 ke around).

21,"Honestly, didn't get to know you much until the 3rd year end. Always tumhe as a shy and introvert student hi dekha...and me being of same type never bothered to talk with many people except the ones in my vicinity. 4th year me had some amount of talks thanks to Dual degree and some courses in common. Through that I got to know how good and kind a person you are. Abhi aage dual ke ek saal me hoping to know you better. ",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a14410819323d199d47c56,Raj  Nandini

Wing me apan dono ka saath me chuda tha 1st sem so saath me 2nd sem aur aage fir improve kiye apne aapko.

Canteen me deep charche, 381 ka assignment, fir kbhi kabar Southern labs ki canteen me chai samosa thinking abt prepping of GATE. Aur iss sem me TP ke assignments aur quizzes.

Jb pta chla same wing me the that was quite exhilarating. First year se hi tum chaapu the as usual. But you were not the usual type of maggu. You took interest mainly in dance and boy..kya naachte ho. I really miss those sessions where you and Kartik danced together in wing and the wing parties jhaa tumhe aur Kartik chhod sb barati dance krte the.
