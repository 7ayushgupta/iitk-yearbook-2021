0,"Pandeyji...one of the most brilliant minds I have seen aur kaafi fortunate hoon ki tumhare jaise log mere dost hain. Learned a lot of things from you since my first year, and you still inspire me to try to run after excellence and how to be an ideal student.  First year me there room me bulla kaatna, padhai ki baate krna, gaana gana, loco khelna, politics ki baate krna ye kaafi fond memories hain. Uske baad wing tootne ke baad interaction km ho gyi but still kaafi baate hoti rehti thi. To me you'll always be a person who is not at all startled by the success hi gets and pursues excellence and not success, cuz success excellence ke peeche jhak maarke aa jaati and you are an example of that. Cheers bhai...aane waale dino me kaafi naam kroge ye hume poora bharosa hain tumpe.",Anirban  Ghosh,True,607e61b3819323d199d46b72,Abhyuday  Pandey

Saath me padhai aur anime ki baate krna, cycle share krna, your stories of your ex-gfs especially jiske liye tum Kolkata tk aa gya tha. Kaafi dukh dard dekhe hai tera, esp after your breakup.

But, yaar jyyuki wing alag ho gyi we lost touch slowly, and covid ne toh pura chuda diya sb kuch...kaafi yaadein aa rhi ye memoir likhte waqt tumhari aur Bibhor ke saath kaati hui.

Tumhare H12PL ke satirical impressions of Aakash Chopra and Jatin Sapru with Yogi ji kaafi yaad rhenge. Apan logo ka shyad 2nd year summer me wing leke panga hua tha if you remember, meeting room me kaafi lambe discussion chle the tumhari aur humari wing me. Saath me ek baar GD prep bhi ki thi internship se pehle. Anyways, aise hi mast insaan rho aur chaapte rho.

7,"Harsh...you are one of the most hard-working and sincere persons I have ever seen. I have seen how hard you used to work in labs and in  the humanoid team. And I liked you simple attitude towards your work. I do remember the walks after breakfast we used to take during summer sem jb tum robotics ka koi internship apply kr rhe the, and also the endsem of CHE381A jb humlogo ka collaborated effort lga tha paper krne me. I hope tum aage bhi aise hi cheerful simple hard working attitude rkhoge aur mast chapoge future me and maybe pursue robotics in future. Cheers bhai!!

First sem me yaad ho toh kaafi baar ECO101 me saath me baithte the..me being sleepy and getting bored and you listening it with attention, cuz tujhe economics mast samajh aati thi. Moving on to 2nd year, Chemical ke courses me saath baithkr mje kiye Ankit ke saath. Also humara TA202A ka pochha machine toh yaad hi hoga tujhe, jo mast pochha lgaya humara evaluation time pe. Fir tu Hall 2 presi bn gya...kaafi busy ho gye, pr apni bonding chemical ne bnayi rkhi ifywim. Kaafi mast insaan ho tum honestly, with good leadership skills. Kaafi mast experience tha tere saath TA me kaam krne ka. Aur fir apne chemical ke courses ke baate toh hai hi. Thoda khush ho jaata agar tu yaar khudse thoda chemical padh leta (I know you hate and fear it to the bones). But, I do feel great that I am great friends with the President of Hall 2. Wish you all the best for the future. ",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a50b2e819323d199d4831c,Sahil Khan
12,"Most humble and ethical man I have seen in my IITK life. Got to know you from 3rd year majorly and then when we both converted to Dual, dosti gehri bn gyi. I remember how you pushed me to solve Thermo problems in detail cuz tu exam see pehle puchhega and then bta nhi paaya toh khudko bura lgega. Indirectly you have made me a better student in terms of solving more problems and doing more practice before exams to prevent mistakes. Also I expect tu aage rona dhona thoda km krega and I sincerely want you to continue being an ethical (which is very hard in these times honestly) and morally sound person that you are. Dosti bani the...that's what I wish.  ",Anirban  Ghosh,True,609a8d47819323d199d4799b,Mohammed Jeeshan Sheikh
13,"Muddu bhai...one of the most chillest and bakchodi waala persons I have ever and will see. Tere jaise log hi hote hain jo hum jaise serious logo ko bhi chill krana seekha dete.

Aur saath me intern ke time test dene jaana aur fir katwakr aa jaana we have come a long way from that.

14,"Nikhil bhai...to be honest apna same wing hote huye bhi 2nd year me jb hum logo ka wing toota tb tumse zyada baatchit hui. In beginning I used to find you rude and somewhat arrogant since tu itna zor zor ka Haryanvi gaana bajata tha aur zor zor se bulla maarta tha...but by 3rd year I had grown fond of you and had respect for your attitude and behaviour. And thanks to you kaafi cheezo ka exposure mila tumhari sangat me (ifywim :) ). Abhi ek saal baaki hai (since tu bhi ab Matka me bhi Matka lol), usme pehle jo masti na kr ske tumhare saath wo krenge. Cheers.",Anirban  Ghosh,True,6079b4bcc5325f8b69d16b34,Nikhil  Kumar
15,"Hello Nipun bhai...first year ke kaafi yaadein hai tumhari, you being Tauuaa master and other nickname given you by Pandeyji (likh nhi rha due to reasons :) ). Tumhara Mess Secy ka campaigning and fir election jeetkr Mess secy bnna. You were the best Mess secy in the 3 years of our stay in Hall 12. And then studying ESO208 together aur assignments jo tu mera use krta tha. But, on an honest note, you are one of the people whom I have seen grow to an awesome personality, and as you have said in your bio, kaafi optimized life jiye ho iss 4 saal me, something which many fail to do. Bss yhi dukh reh gya ki wapis mil nhi paaye since pandemic and we have lost touch since tum kaafi busy ho gye gymkhana aur drams ke responsibilities me, and also wing bhi alag ho gyi thi. Anyways, All the best for your future endeavours, I can already say with confidence (likh ke lelo types) ki tum kaafi successful aadmi bnoge, due to the personality you have built in your stay at IITK.",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a603fb819323d199d48913,Nipun  Goyal

But, there are some traits of your personality jo hum apne me laana chahte, jaise your level of confidence and positivity, leadership and mangement skills jo tumne kaafi dikhaye hall me cricket league organise krwake aur sports council ke kaafi events organise krwake, and also your ability to bond with anyone you like. Kaafi ache time spend kiye hai wing ke parties me, yaad ho toh tumne hi mujhe pehli baar sutta pilaya tha. It's for you guys that college me kuch experiences jo shyad chhut jaati apni wo nhi chhuti. Uss ke liye thank you. Aise hi mast rho, aur aage machate rho apne tarike se.",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a5fb9a819323d199d48896,Pawan Kumar Saini
17,"Hello Pradeep bhai...you will always remind me of a simple, humble guy jo dosto ki khushi me khush hota, and is very happy with himself and working in his own pace. Kaafi friendly aur doston pr pyaar nicchawar krne waale bnde ho...much like Dil Chahta Hain ka Saif Ali Khan (along with Kartik). I know that apni bhut zyaada baate nhi hui, pr jitne bhi hui, kaafi acha lga. Politics ki baate, ESO205 ke assignments (11 bje hota tha tu aata tha room pr discuss krne 9-10 ke around). Kaafi ajeeb gya tha wo course. NH91 me apni wing parties toh yaad rhengi hi. Aise hi ho, simple, loyal, friendly,humble kaafiaage badhoge tum, ye pkka hain. All the best for your future endeavours.

18,"Honestly, didn't get to know you much until the 3rd year end. Always tumhe as a shy and introvert student hi dekha...and me being of same type never bothered to talk with many people except the ones in my vicinity. 4th year me had some amount of talks thanks to Dual degree and some courses in common. Through that I got to know how good and kind a person you are. Abhi aage dual ke ek saal me hoping to know you better. ",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a14410819323d199d47c56,Raj  Nandini

Classses me toh hoti thi baate, majorly interaction start hua 6th sem me jb tu Hall 12 shift ho gya. Canteen me deep charche, 381 ka assignment, fir kbhi kabar Southern labs ki canteen me chai samosa thinking abt prepping of GATE. Aur iss sem me TP ke assignments aur quizzes. Honestly, I wish I could have known more about you. But, aage graduation ke baad dosti bni rhegi, ye pkka vaada hain.",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a140aa819323d199d47c54,Utsav  Akarshan

Jb pta chla same wing me the that was quite exhilarating. First year se hi tum chaapu the as usual. But you were not the usual type of maggu. You took interest mainly in dance and boy..kya naachte ho. I really miss those sessions where you and Kartik danced together in wing and the wing parties jhaa tumhe aur Kartik chhod sb barati dance krte the. As a person, I have never seen so humble, jolly, helpful and good in everything person. To me, you are kind of what it means to be a cool person.

21,"Yogi ji...you are really an unorthodox type of person. Kaafi cheerful aur mast aadmi ho. Normally yaar class me toh baate hoti nhi...interaction majorly 3rd me hi hui zyada. Kaafi expert ho yaar tum hasane me. I fondly remember tumhara aur Divyansh ka satirical impressions of Aakash Chopra and Jatin Sapru in H12PL commentary, kaafi mast lga tha yaar wo. Aur baad me pta chla we do believe in same ideology, that created more bonding. Kaafi upkaar kiye ho yaar tum senator bnke iss sem, uss ke liye general thank you. Aage aise hi outspoken aur mast aadmi rho, and wish you all the very best for future comrade!!",Anirban  Ghosh,True,60a13e0e819323d199d47c4e,Yogeshwar
