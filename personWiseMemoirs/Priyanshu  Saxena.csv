Tum Ho To Gaata Hai Dil
Tum Nahin To Geet Kahan
Tum Ho To Hai Sab Haasil
Tum Ho To Hai Sab Haasil
Tum Ho To Hai Sapno Ke Jaisa Haseen Ek Sama
Jo Tum Ho To Yeh Lagta Hai Ke Mil Gayi Har Khushi
Jo Tum Na Ho Yeh Lagta Hai Ke Har Khushi Mein Hai Kami
Tumko Hai Maangti Yeh Zindagi.....

Tum Ho To Raahen Bhi Hai,
Tum Nahin To Rasthey Kahan
Tum Ho To Yahan Sab Hi Hai,
Tum Nahin To Kaun Yahan
Tum Ho To Hai Har Ek Pal Meharbaan Yeh Jahaan
Jo Tum Ho To Hawa Mein Bhi Mohabbat Ka Rang Hai
Jo Tum Na Ho To Phir Koi Na Josh Na Umang Hai

Tum Mile To Mili Yeh Zindagi",Priyanshu  Saxena,True,60c216ea659165b3aa6458a5,Maitreyee  Srivastava
