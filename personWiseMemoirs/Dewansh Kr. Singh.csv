Yar tu bhut kamal londa hai , bhut hi kamal, itna jyada vibe kia hai ham logo ne in 4 years me. Literally can't express every stupid and crazy things that we have done together. Har bakchodi me choti ya badi tu jrur rhta tha udhr. Mohit ke bdday pe marathi gaano pe or beats pe kya naache the ek din 🔥🕺. Uske baad se to it was just like mauka chahiye to get high 🍻 and dance like crazy and do stupidest of things one could imagine. Ekdm cousin's wli feel ati thi tum logo se. Ekdm bhaiyo wali. Jo man me aye wo krlo bina soche samjhe. Iitk gate pe jaake momosn khana, randomly jab bhi man kia bazooka chle jate the pelne 😂😂. Summer's me wo double room me cooking bhi kre kitna saath me induction pe 😋😂. YouTube pe ishq ka raja ki video or bhi ese hi kai gaane sunnna , bhai sb bhut miss hoga. We can literally talk and vibe on anything yr. Idhr memoir me to jyada kya hi likhu, jaldi se aa milne wpis lucknow betha jaye mehfil bnate hai ghumte hai khate pite hai ♥️.

4,"There are certain points in one's life, some life turning decisions.One of it was me agreeing to go play water polo.Ye incident chipka hua hai dimag me, or rhe bhi kyu nhi, there i met You bhai<3. Us 1 hr me hi, we made small talks and i realised you already know everyone i know, in fact you even knew me!! :P. For me you were the first jisse ekdam se itne kam time me hi, itna strong connection bana. Gladly apne pe photo bhi hai tbki :P

In these 4 years, we’ve shared almost all our lows and all our ‘highs’ together. First year ki summers me D211 me gadda dal lia tha tune mere room me hi, din bhr bs binging on netflix and having snacks. Zsquare Mac lene gye the, rokde me payment kia :P, fir pizza hut pe party. Midsem and endsem ke time mere room pe bethke pdhna, sare last rush hour pe assignments likhna. Dange, tere or mere library me wo constant sessions, exam time night outs. Kitni numerous choti choti memories hai bro hmari. Random Lucknow trips, Chandu or tere sath rooftop pe meri pehli beer, Nh91 ka mera first hukka or fir supposedly meri chair ka hilna :P. Random bazooka and zsquare trips apni. That one day ramaiya pe cab leke aya tu, and tera wo “welcome to kanpur” sbse epic. Bhai its just tu sath hai na tab tak sb shi lgta, its like singh galat hone hi ni dega kuch, he’ll handle everything somehow. <333. Remember ek din me aya tha tere room preshan, gusse me bhi kisi pe, and fir tune mujhe bitakhe samjhaya about the college life,life in general ,friends and the number of fingers we have on our hand. Will never forget that lesson. Cheers to all the innumerable parties,lectures, assignments, labs, fests, Music sessions and to the innumerable memories that we made along the way🥂. 

You have always made me feel like home, in fact more than home, tune ek “real” brother ki kami puri kari hai meri life me. Mujhko jara si bhi preshani hoti thi ya dar lagta tha, ya anything, i always used to seek out for you first. Itne aasani se mujhe or meri life ki bt handle kse kr leta tha tu. You are the reason for most of the things or experiences that i’ve managed to pull off in these 4 years, i just couldn’t have done all that by myself bro, tu sath rhta tha to ek confidence rhta tha. I've shared directly or indirectly my every ‘first’ experience of life with you. Bhut sare personal experiences as well as spiritual experiences.

Or han meri trip kharab nhi hui thi that day, and na kharab hone ka reason bhi tu hi hai, you said to me earlier “apni trip ham khud drive krte hai”. I was so focused on this the whole time that i never went down. Infact the time when you, me and jayesh were in the Oat, wo moment mujhe lifetime yaad rhega, about the things we talked, and felt even without talking, about being there for each other no matter what. Baki we’ll trip again sometime soon, some different place this time. You might not have an idea kitna impact hai tera meri life pe. We laughed together and cried together. We are spirit brothers and share a bond that's forever unbroken.

Baki bhai ye memoirs me nhi kr skta sab express, your’e too precious for that. I’ve literally lost count teko kitni bar HC ya bhr Hospital leke aya hu. Abhi dur rhega to tbiyat ka khayal rkhna apna, tu kohinoor hai mera, bhut chamkna hai abhi life me aage. We’ve shared a connection for a lifetime, abhi bhut punye or paap krne hai sath me 🥂. 

Perfect lines for this perfect brotherhood <3
