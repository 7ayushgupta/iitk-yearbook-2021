Don\'t get big on ego after reading whatever lies ahead. I am still expecting you to call me one fine day and say \\"aur Shikanji, kya chal raha hai\\". \\n\\nThe first memory I have of you is during NTSE celebration where someone informed me that there is a new NTSE boy in the JEE-infatuation town. Since then, I don\'t know how, but you were this goofy kid who turned into pretty much the only friend I had there. It\'s true that the friendship involved a lot of leg-pulling almost all the time, but I have made peace with that being the default setting now. I am glad that even before coming on campus, you were a friend I could always trust on. I was so disappointed the whole time I thought you wouldn\'t come to IITK. Well, for better or for worst, it did happen and I am so so glad that it did. \\n\\nI wouldn\'t go on to say \\"yaar X year was so fun with you\\" because you have been one constant in my life. I know we grow in and out of conversation but there is this unsaid understanding that everytime one of us calls the other, we pick up right where we left, with no idea of time gap whatsoever. I don\'t say it, but here it is, you are my comfy-bag. there are things that I know that you\'re the only one who\'ll understand. Of course that will need getting through the layer of you being an annoying kid, but totally worth it :)\\n\\nEvery Anataragini, every CCD hangout, every RM study session has been fun because of you. Being in absolutely different branches but being most comfortable studying with each other is something we developed before coming here and it is so amazing that we preserved it even until the end. Third year mein, you were pretty much the only person I looked forward to hang out with. Our collective love for CCD and juvenile insanity has kept us together. Be it dancing on the streets in Kolkata or jumping on the events grounds, be it throwing away my heels or throwing me away, life has always been fun around you. \\n\\nI am in complete awe of the kind of energy you possess and how you tend to dissipate it to the people around you. Problems, however big, become easier to handle after talking to you. Who cares about fucking up life when your life is at risk while cycling with you. Genuine advice -  whenever your friend falls off the cycle, it is always better to extend an arm for help rather than standing there and laughing your guts out. \\n\\nLast two months on campus, whenever I walked down that road between CCD and RM, I remembered how we would dance there at 3 AM on Beatles songs. With you, I kind of stop caring about the weird glances from public. I am sure we got many in Kolkata and so did we on campus, but whop cares, right!  I missed not being called to CCD for random paper soap supplies and being called tatti 50 times a day. I missed chasing you and falling down. I guess I just missed being that kid who stopping growing with you after 15. All of that annoyed me but also made me feel weirdly alive. Thanks for making every moment spent with you so lively. \\n\\nThis is all about the paagalpanti, but you are also my RR partner. Be it courses, guys, friends or family. The level of vibe is beyond everything with you. Once in a while I wake up and I am like ooooh I miss my Doodyman and then I text/call you. It\'s just this plain comfortable friendship that I believe will only ripen, even when you are old and I am as hot as always. \\n\\nThis is me, your Tatti, walking away doing \\"I wanna hold your hand\\" (you know how :)","author":"Medha  Agarwal","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf867f659165b3aa64680b"}]}]'
