From correcting my cheezy lines and cliches in vox, to shaping my arguments in debsoc, to teaching me so much during our debates in hall 2, to always being there to support me when I was down. You\'ve always been that special friend for me, that special companion who\'s seen and been a part of so much of my journey that I can\'t even imagine what I would have done without you. You\'ve seen me grow from my infancy in IITK (well, I\'m still an infant, won\'t you agree XD) to something resembling an adult at the end of my four years, and I\'ve always relied on your constant love and support to help me in that journey.

I think I have debated once in my whole life in first year Galaxy and you broke me down to shreds (Well I really enjoyed that experience nonetheless). After that, in the 3rd semester, we used to discuss discrete math and other CS courses in the library. I still remember how we both were struggling in discrete, and in the end, you took some hiatus and then emerged victorious after that endsem (LoL). \\n\\nThere are a bunch of people that are hardworking in IITK and a bunch of intelligent people. But believe me when I say this, that I have seen no other person that is as sharp and intelligent and at the same time as dedicated and hardworking as you. The reason that you do so well in debates is the same reason that you do so well in courses. You are genuinely curious to understand anything and everything thrown at you and give it your all until you know. Our beloved 4th semester and your beloved Thermo course will always be a cherished memory. You choosing to make fun of a professor and then securing an A* from the same guy, is a story I would love to recite many more times.  Apart from that in almost every course (atleast till the time you were in IITK), be it you teaching me 220 and OS,  be it TA Lab (Oh god the things I had to hear!) or Machine Learning (the low effort A*), we have shared some great memories. During the internship season, I got to know that you are not like the rest of us who would do something they are not interested in, just because everyone else is doing it or not. It was inspiring for me and played a significant role in giving me the confidence to give up on the conventional route and work on what I truly want to. Thanks for that.\\n\\nMy heart swells with happiness whenever you do something extraordinary (which is very often, of course) because I want people like you to climb the food chain. I am more sure than anyone else that you will achieve whatever you want to and lots more. Will try my best to keep in touch and meet whenever possible.\\n\\nCheers SidJay!","author":"Snehal  Raj","visibility":false,"_id":"60d02410659165b3aa646974"}]}]'
