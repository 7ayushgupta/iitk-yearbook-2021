Respect ++\\nBhai kahan se shuru karu, sab toh janta hi hai tu. Since ye printed form me aane wala hai, I can only write ki jab bhi padhna, call kar lena bhai. Kisi bhi random technical topic pe discussion start kr denge :p. Because ig that\xe2\x80\x99s one strong thing connecting us together. Right from 1st year, Code Fun Do me collaborate karne se start kiya (Technical Checkpoint #1), fir NYO (Technical Checkpoint #2) - tere saath hi puri intern ki hai bhai wo toh. Shikher ke under same team me kaam karna was a delight! Then, came 2nd year apne kuchh courses common hue (Technical Checkpoint #3). Thermo ki class me quora ke answers padhte the xD. Bhai fir apna Flutter wala discussion, IITK ke 2 major fests ke 1st ever apps apni wing se hi develop hue hai and guess the developers (Technical Checkpoint #4). Fir tu bangalore me macha rha tha, hum log world cup dekh rhe the xD. Intern season me you were a constant information source (Technical Checkpoint #5), GD preparation se leke resume discussions tak, bohot help ki hai bhai. Shayad kabhi formally \xe2\x80\x9cThank you\xe2\x80\x9d nhi bol paaya, it was known ig but wo as a feel hamesha thi aur rahegi. Then tune EE me double major ki uspe kaafi discussion hua and I feel it was one the best decisions you made. Software se core ka jump is something that takes a lot of perspective, belief and guts. You have it all. I am amazed and inspired by all that you have been doing since then. EE ke courses pe discussion, IP me itna collaboration xD (Technical Checkpoint #6). Fir toh bhai, apni Dec trip to MP. Itni backchodi bhai. You were the partner in crime for sure, mauj lene se lekar meme game tak, kya sync hai apna. Bhai last months on campus were beautiful with you. Late nights and seemingly important but random discussions on engineering, tech, Julia and core sector ka future were my most exciting talks, still gives me chills (Technical Checkpoint #n). Running with airpods, listening to Brown Munde on loop, getting clean bold on the first ball xD, untimely sabbaticals, Managing Jay Gupta, Paneer banana, Peg banana, sab kar liya bhai saath me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have words beyond this point. I\xe2\x80\x99m just so much drowned in nostalgia. You have been the centerpiece of everything we have done in the last few days at IITK, will definitely miss those moments badly. Buchas bc ne account hi nhi banaya hai, warna uska bhi likhta. Anyway, concluding all of it, I really appreciate ki tune busy hone ke baad bhi itna time spend kiya hamare saath. I really respect your work, am a fan tbh and you know this. Bas bhai, itna grow kiya hai tune in every aspect of life ki you definitely were and will be the pro-est of the pros. Fuffa naam toh mene hi diya hai, but Sir ki upadhi bhi aapki hi hai haq se.
