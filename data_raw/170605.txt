Vo DS ke assignments krna, Thermo exam mai khaali baithe rehna se lekar MTH ke courses mai C khaana aur fir room mai aakr dragon ball z khelna sab yaad rhega. Will miss those late night badminton matches and canteen ki chai pr charcha. Geekiest and most knowledgeable person of our MTH group. Kisi din CS GO ka match pakka se khelenge.

I guess we started interacting in first year cause our roll nos were near and we were close by in most of our labs. That and probably our mutual love for chicken, which has helped out through fests. I would always claim credit for introducing you to anime, and now you have surpassed me in that area loll! I think I was probably more appalled than you when you came to MTH in second year, that\'s a story in itself! That and many other instances over the years, would make you as a guy in my mind who remains true to his nature, and not being afraid to take the unorthodox decision.  Remember, how you became the guy who, despite willing to avoid development stuffs, always managed to do more of it! I think we bonded over our mutual interests and life views, and penchant for geekiness. And slowly I also came to know that devilish mind hiding behind an innocent facade!  Anyways, best of luck for your future endeavors and I would hold you to that Japan trip in December!","author":"Sandeep Kumar Routray","visibility":true,"_id":"60c1e560659165b3aa645638"},{"text":"Bhai yaar, regret hota kabhi kabhi ki 1st year mein terese ekdum baat kyun nahi hua tha.

Started by being Bros through IITK culture, to becoming bros for life. As far as I have known him, iske ghar pr allowed nhi mai , mostly his fault for telling his mom about dynamite and Altaaf bhai. But despite that, we have remained friends for long. From being unusual roommates in 2nd year to destroying everyone at R6 2v5. Ye nightout nahi maarta tha 1st year me, to playing FIFA all night after that. Only place where i\'ll say, \\" Pro gamer to tu hai except FIFA obviously\\". Despite so much bakchodi during our stay, I know gazab chaapu banda hai ye. I cherish all the philosophical discussions that we had while going to sleep. I surely can\'t imagine IITK without you.
