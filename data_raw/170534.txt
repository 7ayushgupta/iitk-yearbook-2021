Ehh............\\" - Raj Nandini while eating maggie from Chomcy room.\\nYup, we have come a long way from being partners in TA202, which tbh non of us remembers, but it is where our story begins. 3rd semester, being an introvert, it was already difficult for me to retain old friends, leave alone making new ones. But this is when we met (rather an insignificant meeting at hall 3 cc). Who would have thought that a meeting like that would be the start of a lifetime of memories, adventures (BPI), discoveries (still you don\'t remember IITK map :P), a brand new \\"lenguez\\", trust, love, and night outs. My journey at IITK has been a rollercoaster ride, had it been not with you it would have been just a downhill because you were always there for me in my lowest and also at my highest peaks. You are genuinely the most loving and caring person I ever came across and I will forever be grateful to you for each and everything you did for me, be it as little as teaching me in the lambrary before exams or accompanying me for a shamke at mamamio. This past month was this beautiful castle that one works to build his entire life, changing the meaning associated with each place. For me bad memories being replaced by joyous moments and places meaning more than just places. The last night walk that we had made me realise how quickly the good time went, how little we had and how much we made out of it. As strange as it may seem, we will always have a shortage of time and opportunities but as I learnt from you we will make sure to make the most out of them even if it means faking smiles and acting strongly in front of you so that you feel everything is fine as I have done till now. Yes, there were many things that I couldn\'t write here (including most of our time at OMT :P) but we still have many adventures to look forward to and make memories along the way so buckle up for this new phase of life with which we have many expectations.

Even the pandemic couldn\'t keep us away :p; we had a good number of video calls and texts.\\n   How can I not mention that chit that we dropped to your neighbour - this is one of the fun things I have done at IITK :p.
