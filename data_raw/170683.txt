I remember our first conversation to be the one about me wanting to go to sleep early xd. You did respect privacy of people, and were one of the few who understood what was offensive and what wasn\'t. During a particular time when majority of the wing disliked me, you were one of the very few who I could confide in without the feeling of my words becoming public knowledge once I left. You have always been polite and sweet to me, and that in itself seemed such a rarety among the people we were surrounded with. Our conversations were sudden and interesting, from the censored parts of Anne Frank\'s diary to the you clicking pictures of me doing my favorite course TA101 during Antaragni, it was such a colorful journey we had. I wish I could be there for you when you were going through a tough phase emotionally, but I got the knowledge of that much later, although I should have checked in on you more often. You have waded past that phase with much strength, avoided toxicity without delving in it, and I believe that has made you wiser. I wish we could spend a lot more time but the \\"China Virus\\" (two offensive country jokes in one memoir xd) happened, so here we are. I would love to be in touch with you, and hope to meet you real soon. All the best for your future, bud!","author":"Sagnik  Bhattacharya","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf7114659165b3aa6466c6"},{"text":"Guten Tag, (an ode to the german class you never completed XD)\\n\\nAs pointed out, we met usse pehle bhi Antaragni mein, Pratigya introduced us there (seriously, why would I wish a random stranger!). To be honest, mujhe tu kabhi \\"hamesha high\\" nahi laga and that in your case is saying something!!! But but but, I have never met anyone else with the depth of logical explanations that you seemingly possess. You can bloody back up any and every action of yours with a perfectly reasonable sounding explanation. I love that about you. We did have great times together and I cannot deny how much I loved our super long conversations about the most random stuff. You\'re the best reddit buddy I know. I still remember that one comment of yours about a rare subreddit that got pretty famous and the whole coincidence around it. Your coat hanger was amazing man! I wish I had one too. Always had my eyes on yours though XD. It was pretty amazing seeing you towards the end, it felt good to connect with you again like we never got distanced. That\'s the stuff about our friendship, it\'ll never be affected while apart. Pratigya ke birthday ke gift pe likhe hue short 4 liner poems yaad hai? Cake girna toh yaad hoga hi XD! Shit just remembered, Vox ki freshers\' video kitni amazing thi together. Shooting and editing. Remember the Wales joke? Here\'s more random stuff, Loved the way you fried ants inside your laptop, by the way. Hemant ko dhundhna that last party mein was so fun. We walked the skywalks of Hall-5 <3! I feel like with our friendship, life is a series of unrelated wacky adventures lol. \\n\\nAnyway, Thank you for the 3 am Chowpati visits with me. I just knew I would only find you at that ungodly hour ready for a snack and chat! A lot here will be left unsaid and I don\'t think I can do justice to everything with these words, so I prefer we talk it out in person. Just know that I have always found a really good friend in you and I want it to remain the same going forward. \\n\\nTo all the good times and more, cheers!","author":"Ayush  Agarwal","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf82e0659165b3aa6467b4"}]}]'
