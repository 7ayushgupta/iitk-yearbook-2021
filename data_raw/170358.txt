Mera one and only \xe2\x80\x9cfight club\xe2\x80\x9d victory aapke against hi hai, 100% win rate hai apna xD. Aur wo pizza bet kaise bhul sakte hai, 2 large non-veg pizza khilwaye the aap. Apan 4 saal me jitna bet lagye hoonge utna to shayaad hi koi lagaya hoga. Abhi waise ek aur bacha hai, kabhi US me aake uska bhi liya jayega. Mohawk hairstyle is still onnn. Aur campus ka last month to humesha memorable rahega. Wo din abhi bhi yaad hai jis din aapka Stanford me hua tha, andr se aisa khushi ho rha tha ki jaise mera hi ho gya ho. Uske baad aapka pura future me clubs ka planning kiye the hm log xD. College choose krne ke liye bhi kitna lamba discussions kiye the apan. Aur aap wo pehle aadmi the jo mere se \xe2\x80\x98lodu\xe2\x80\x99 sune the. This will go to your tombstone. Wo din yaad hai jab hm aapko gila krne ke liye apne hi bed pr paani daal diye the xD. Saath me football khelne me bhi bahut mazza aaya. Aur Fifa me to kya haarte the bhai, bahar jaane se pehle atleast thoda apna Fifa skills badhaye bhai. Waise aapse jyada ache se work life balance manage krne wala koi banda nhi dekhe hai. Aur ekdum practical bande hai aap, this is the best quality jiske liye hm aapke pass aate rhenge for major life decisions. Best of luck aage ke liye, IK ki aap world ke best statistician baniyega ya ek so so professor :p. Bahar jaake bhul mat jayega, I have a feeling ki dono end me ek hi city me kaam krenge ;).

Till then, here goes your memoir.\\n\\nIn our first year, I remembered you as \\"vo jo vox ki treat.baant raha tha\\", or so I was told. Even then, I found you one of the most sensible guys from just a couple of interactions. This attribute of yours hasn\'t changed a bit, but the whole list needs way more pages. \\n\\nI\'ve awarded you with many titles along the way \\nlike \\"blue earphones vaala(I didn\'t call them earphones obviously ),\\" \\"prank partner,\\" and whatnot. But whenever anyone asks me about you, I may say that he is the one person who will take responsibility for his actions, who has principles and is passionate about his views and opinions(I admire that so much about you btw). And despite all these descriptions are accurate, what I\'ll really want to say is that Kushagra is a feeling. He is an experience that can not be described; one would have to water the friendship enough for the greener grass to grow (Flowers are ugly). \\n\\nI respect you an insane amount for who you are and how you\'ve become what you are. You are one hell of a loyal friend, and I know I can always count on you. I know my secrets are undoubtedly safe with you. The talk we had that afternoon was difficult for me too, but you made that a unicorn ride. You can expect the same amount of loyalty from my side because it is a two-way street, and I\'ll be happy to wave at you while crossing. The truth is you didn\'t pick up the phone that day; I called you first <3. \\n\\nWhen we first met, I thought we\'d never click because you were a snob, and so was I, and yet it matured with listening to my never-ending talks to a hand on my shoulder with the words \\"I am here for you.\\" So here\'s an ode to our non-judgemental friendship.\\n\\nLove you loads <3\\nPS: I am crafting a new weapon to kill you xD","author":"Gunjan  Jalori","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf2303659165b3aa646589"},{"text":"I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember how we first met, and we never talked regularly over these last years.

While, as you know, I have many opinions about the the set of people I met there (some grossly generalising), you were an outlier even then. Just a fun-loving and fun-imparting guy even in the most anxiety-inducing places such as a parliamentary debate. In a room full of people pretending to know more shit than they do, you came goofing around with your little Star Wars (Trek?, lol I dunno) presentation. It was super super fun. I know many have called you arrogant/inapproachable in the first year, however, I have always found an excessively warm friend in you from the starting. \\n\\nI am so happy that we became friends outside the zone of our first exposure. The Kushagra then for me was a branch-mate. The Kushy now is a remarkable friend. I guess we have to thank stats for it. Right from the start of our first Bayesian project, I have found myself extremely comfortable in your company. Bugging you every millisecond with a \\"yaar code nahi chal raha\\" doubt and writing that (horrible :) Word project report with you was a foundation of a great friendship. I am so glad it did not end there. In fact our journey has crossed path, shared paths, and sometimes even borrowed paths. \\n\\nI know I haven\'t said this much, or at all maybe, but you are someone whose energy has guided my life at IITK immensely. You are brilliant in what you do, but the best part about you is that you never made me feel scared of that. It was intimidating at times, but you always extended a warm friendly support.  You were always like \\"arre aise kar le na\\", \\"arre ho jaayega\\", \\" tu toh kar legi\\". In hindsight, this encouragement kept me going many a times. From the day you helped me write my first ML assignment code in RM, the list has been going on. I know you are responsible for a lot of stuff that we have done together to become the MTH Stats-duo (like you said AA and GJ are way behind in the league). Bayesian project, talks, DV\'s projects, mentoring projects, and on and on. I knew I could just dive right in whenever you came with an idea to do something together. I knew I\'d learn a lot and have limitless fun. Thanks for being such an amazing and inspiring friend. And I know this is not just for me. You are in general an insanely lanky person who brings \'inspiration wrapped in friendship\' in people\'s lives. Always be like that. Once someone can get over your lankiness and the fact that you find the idea of eating humans quite glorious, you are a pretty darn awesome human (?). \\n\\nEven though you\'ll be forever be in debt of my notes, the trade was only fair with the awesome company you provided me in the Stats classes. I loved doing Prob theory assignment on RM boards and sitting in stochastic classes together. Life was fun in third year because of you. Okay I am done vibing over Maths and Stats. Some more content ahead.\\n\\nI don\'t know how but talking to you is so easy. I can go hours and hours chatting with you, ON TEXT! Otherwise itna patience nahi hai mujhme. Even though I take pride in being a great listener, for me, the trophy would any day go to you. I have found an empathetic listener in you who always knows the right things to say at the right time. You are not the \\"sab theek ho jaayega\\" or \\"chill maar na\\" guy. You are someone with whom after a four hours of conversation, you come out feeling good even i life is shit. You were the first one I have \'wanted\' to talk to when I am immensely confused or upset. After Millie, the first time I felt completely okay was after talking to you. Goa ke baad, you were the first one I talked to. I just feels right, always. And man do you know big secrets about me due to that. Uhmmmm, dare you!\\n\\nI am so glad we did the Goa trip together Also thanks for getting (fighting) me in it. LOL. I have so many more things i should thank you for - grad apps, thoughtful birthday audiobooks, etc etc but I know I don\'t need to. Because this is not end This is just the beginning baby.

Yet, every time you pick a book, a different one falls off the shelf.\\nInitially, you pick up the book but don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it fell off from. You try to locate its position but fail to do so and keep it aside. Next, you try reading the book you previously picked up instead of continuing the search. This unlocks the curse of the library on you. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t finish this book within a specific time, all the books will fall off on you. You are rushing with adrenaline and quickly finishing up the book while enjoying it at the same time. But the time ran out, and another one fell off. You can\xe2\x80\x99t locate its position again, and the cycle continues. \\nSlowly you start enjoying the puzzle and understand the mystery of falling off the books. You pick up the last book you read and place it in its correct position. Finally, you break out of the curse, and all the books go back to their original positions. \\n\\nEvery memory I have of talking to you is like me in this library. The questions, arguments, opinions, secrets come down on me like those books, and I love that thrill of going through them before a new one comes. It all comes together every time, and I think that your voice is the real curse of the library because sometimes it can use my company. \\n\\nI can never write a befitting description of memories of those experiences, but I can only tempt you with the idea of an extensive library and lots of books.\\nFrom wassup to patli gali se nikal we haven\xe2\x80\x99t explored even half of that library. So I would like to build a section there especially for books with names for your future theorems and all kinds of emoxymorons.\\n\\nYou probably like the sound of your voice too much xD, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you ask so many questions.\\nQuestions that sometimes leave me clueless, compel me to think hard, drive me crazy while answering them, or bring me closer to myself and you. \\n\\nPeople might have told you; you make it easy to talk to you. I think they never got to the point when the conversation peaks and it becomes difficult not to keep talking to you. I would like a constant supply of that for me very much. \\nYou challenge me every time we talk. Your words challenge my ideas. Your questions challenge my arguments. Your arguments challenge my notions of rationality.\\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit with which you charge into conversations, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I love about our unfiltered exchanges. When we first decided to go unfiltered, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I signed up for all the shades of unfiltered we painted over every canvas of a topic possible. \\n\\nKnow that I never have and will never give up on you and your questions. So come at me with all that you have because I won\xe2\x80\x99t hold back from taking the pains of arguing, discussing, explaining, learning, considering, convincing and getting convinced. \\n\\n*now playing Jambi by TOOL in the background*\\n\\nMemories. What are they really?\\nWere they the times we spend together or the time I spent thinking about you and laughed counts too?\\nWere they the times when we debated relentlessly for hours, or would the time I looked forward to discussing something with you count too?\\nWere they the times we spent sharing songs or the time I listened to those songs on repeat counts too?\\nDo the times we drifted apart, but I thought about you, discussed you and missed you count too?\\nDoes time when I pushed hard after being inspired by you, counts too?\\nWere they the times we discussed the meaning of happiness or the nights we walked and walked happily?\\n\\nIt would be an understatement that you have grown a lot over these years. But, what never changed was your place in my life. Of course, we had our fair share of silences too. The time when we drifted apart, probably for good, was when I realised your importance in my life. \\nIt struck me you are gentle when you try to calm my conscious down; you keep your judgements aside when you listen to me; you like me even on the days I don\xe2\x80\x99t like myself.\\n\\nYou have my heart, and I will miss you every time I walk around in libraries <3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","author":"Avisha","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf89c0659165b3aa646872"},{"text":"Apni pehli two meetings bohot bakchod thi - CCD me after winning that Vox thingy and freshers night pe when we tried to heckle each other. I asked you about a place ki vo kahan hai and you said gate ke baahar hai (lame toh tu tha hi). But after that there was to be so much more heckling but from the same side, which would solidify you as a special friend. Your whip was the whippiest whip I\'ve seen from IITK and it was always a pleasure to debate with you. Gambit me break banta tha yaar apna. Equally heartening have been the multiple nashe sessions we\'ve had (especially the one in which mai Antaragni ke initiative soch rha tha with your able input), and I love your passion towards life. The most casually chaapu and versatile person I know. Alumni ke bolne pe dance karna and bhand ho ke winter camp me aana was super fun, and whenever there are such fun experiences to be had your energy makes the situation 10x better. You are a trusted friend and a good dancer, always stay the same and all the best for Stanford.

We have to go on a walk together and not like the one in Goa. That is the strangest walk session I have ever had. A walk to remember for sure. Got to know you up close in Goa and I must say gaadi chalana nahi ata hai tujhe. Who gives an indicator on a road with no turns?. The black sheep bistro ghee roast pork was the best. Tried a little visibly too hard to get you on our South Goa camp, need to work on some acting skills, lol. The bhand you is inspirational and it\'s sad that our Bombay Sapphire party planning committee was a major failure. I had no idea that getting high on high fever is a thing xD. Back on campus, our attempt to scare that group from OAT to Mamma Mio when high, devising a plan to kick some ass there, tells me that we have good potential to make more kick-ass plans. \\n\\nWe have an amazing meet-up story that cracks me up every time I talk about it. Got to know you better a little too late. You are an amazing person to be around. You have always been so warm, welcoming, and wholesome. Stay in touch. More daaru sessions together when in town.  \\n\\nHow about some part-time dance gigs? Light it up! \\n\\nPS: What is the live-in situation?

Anyway, I\'ll get to it now. You made writing this super tricky, man, as if it wasn\'t already. As I gear up to write, there it is again, that funny feeling. It isn\'t nostalgia; it\'s a cocktail of gratitude, appreciation, admiration, and love towards your being. Looking back to the Jaipur days, talking random shit outside the center, however unnecessary, was the seed of what would nurture into one of the most supportive branches of my IITK tree. Long story short, it cannot be stressed enough how much good you have done for me. I won\'t disrespect that by trying to assign words to it. You might have saved me at a time when I for sure did not have the strength to do it myself. I don\'t think I ever told you this, but this feels like an appropriate time to let the cat out of the bag. \\n\\nWhatever you do, you do it with such conviction. Consequently, your plans have exceptional clarity, and I am always somewhere following you along the road uphill. Although it has been a long road that led us here, I feel like there are so many aspects I am yet unaware of. A big part of you remains a mystery to me, but I am grateful for the sides I got to experience. You are so versatile and adaptive to the environment around you. No wonder you\'re a part of so many groups that are ideologically poles apart. You try to extract the most fun out of every situation without ever taking it your heart, and that is a quality a very select few possess. It is weird how fast you speak when you\'re passionate about the conversation, debating is scary with you at times! The speed at which your thoughts change is genuinely hard to grasp. \\n\\nThat said, we found love in Stats together that saved us from Algebra\'s devil-ish grasps. Sharing nearly every MTH course, sitting side by side, understanding our way through it, right there and then was perhaps what made it look so easy. I don\'t think I would\'ve done half as well as I did if not for us challenging each other for an explanation of even the minor intricacies we could find. Our veritas-style board was all I needed to be confident! You listed out almost all of the things that were unique to us, and here are some more: Researching the hell out of unsolvable problems,  obsessing over finding houses (you know whose XD), most useless bets (one of which got me into huge trouble, ugh!! Side note: Sorry for the behaviour that day though), the \'90s themed photoshoot, weirdest pranks, and practical jokes, Hannibal! It was all super fun. And here\'s a list of things I couldn\'t have done without your help: that Chief-Ed presentation, every fucking step of the college grad applications, GSoC, My research work with Dootika ma\'am, Medha (XD), Goa trip, life etc etc etc. I cannot thank you enough for all of these. Just know that I am forever indebted to you, and I owe it all to you. \\n\\nHonestly, I can\'t go on much longer with this, but know that it isn\'t the end. Finding \'Atleast 6\' was one of the best things that happened to me; I\'m glad we will always have that safe in the knowledge that it is here to stay. The creativity we have channeled in that group is unparalleled. You\'re incredibly creative when you put your mind to something. I need more music recommendations!! I\'ve seen you achieve so much, and that is genuinely heartwarming to me; I feel like a part of it to a point where I cried my eyes out when I heard about your grad school acceptance in UW (then you outdid yourself, haha). \\n\\nSorry for whenever I might have done you wrong or the parts where I couldn\'t do enough. Thank you for being a person I could trust and the one that helped me find trust in myself.\\n\\nCheers to all the good times. And to many more in the US.
