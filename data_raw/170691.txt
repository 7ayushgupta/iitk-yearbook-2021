It was a great comfort and support having you there. Thank you! Uttrakhand trip was a milestone in our friendship and since then coming to your room, discussing last year papers and revising formulas from your notes diary became a ritual before exams. \\n\\nKaafi chaapu ho bhai tm ever ready with sharp and subtle replies.

Kisi bhi din, kisi bhi samay, bas tumhare room jaake baith jao and kaafi maza aata tha. It just happens that even without trying you can crack jokes out of thin air by judging people, exposing unspoken customs and just using that sharp brain of yours to make super weird connections. Jab bhi room ghuso, hamesha lete rahoge, mobile dekhte rahoge aur agar exams paas aa rahe ho toh padhte rahoge.  Mai aur tum khaane ka interest bhi share karte the and canteen me numerous times saath me khaya hai humne. \\n\\n First year me toh almost saare  and second year ke kuch courses saath me discuss karte the and Vipul Arora (fraud) internship bhi saath me hi kara tha. In general jo bhi courses tumhare saath kiya hai, usse yeh toh keh sakta hu bohot tez ho bhai tum. Mai ek mahina padh ke bhi jitne number nahi laa sakta, tum bc ek raat me nikal lete ho. People might think that you start studying late, but I would say that you start studying at the exact time that is needed. Ek week pehle se tumhara fatna chalu ho jaata hai and uss last week me jo kuch kar lete ho tum, that shows that you can adapt in any situation and are fucking intelligent.  I am sure you will excel a lot (I say this for very few people).\\n\\nAll our fights and dissing aside, you have always been very helpful and you have always respected me (more than I deserved). Bilkul bhi fake nahi karte apne aap ko and  apna mazaak udane se bhi piche nahi hat te. Tumhare saath rehke maza toh kaafi aata hai. I know you are driven highly by achieving success and kisi bhi cheez me dimaag laga doge toh achieve toh kar hi loge. \\n\\nIn future, I will always be ready to help in whatever way I can and would love to keep in touch. Machate toh tum rahoge hi, bas apna confidence level thoda badhao aur woh tatti clash of clans khelna band karo.\\n\\nCheers Shubham","author":"Snehal  Raj","visibility":true,"_id":"60a7bfc1819323d199d492b7"},{"text":"Dude your style of work/study is amazing and inspirational.
