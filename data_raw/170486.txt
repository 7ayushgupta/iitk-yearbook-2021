This was a phase in our life long friendship. We started out as buddies here, and we have shared a lot of time together. You were a part of almost all the ventures we had and you surely will be in the days to come. :D To mention, it is difficult to keep you awake on a night-out, but it so fun to have night-outs with you. You got over your photo-phobia (finally). You may be an introvert to others, but we bring out your talkative self by just saying and asking the right things. I love the online game battles we have time to time, also the art showoffs are quite enjoyable.

And how we used to find different shapes on the surface of those metals which we had to draw? That was in a way just like finding shapes in the clouds.

BARC was a really memorable journey for us. I recall the time spent together sitting in front of the PIR Sensors.  We have been to Mumbai thrice for BARC. The first one was to IIT B in December 2018.  The second and third trip was to the BARC Mumbai office for presenting our prototype In May and August 2019.  Some funny events that I recall during our presentation at IIT B was the cup of tea spilling on the judge which led to our team getting extra time for the presentation.  The best part was our chat on the messenger group with Suraj, Abhigyan, Ashok. Might go through the chat to relive the experience of Techmeet once again ! We are fortunate to have connected with our alumni Sumit Chowdhury who later met us in Hall 12 canteen during his visit to IIT K.\\n\\nIt is great that you are pursuing double major in EE.
