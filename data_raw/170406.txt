You were the first whom I admired a lot. I still do. The passion for things. Got to learn a lot from you. Not just the exams but this very nature of being passionate about some things in life. We really get positive vibes from you. Though some part was a bit misleading I feel in your life, but I hope that was for the greater good! Will always always stay in touch with you. Take proper care of yourself, especially when you are experimenting with yourselves!
