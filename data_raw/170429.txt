So, where to start from.  First of all thanks for my CPI. I think one of the differences between my first year CPI and the overall CPI is you. We did not interact much in the first year compared to what followed later i.e. barging into your room all the time. So, thanks for that 0.5 vaala part. Since, Nikunj would have already written ki tu IITK ka sabse accha insaan hai, I would try to skip that part. You deserved to become an SG more than nikunj or I of course. Man, now when I am thinking besides being an accha insaan, thanks for all the motivation you have given me while my RnD Rona. Maybe you were morally obliged to do so at that time because of your nature but still, you always responded the way an RnD rona should have been addressed. I think among all my friends, sabse jyada time there saath spent kiya. And what can I say about your weird cheezen? Hanging up the phone after the other person so that it\xe2\x80\x99s not rude.
