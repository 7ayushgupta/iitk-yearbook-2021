Everyone falls in their journey, but the best have the strength to get back up and keep moving. I respect you man, because I see you bear that strength. It\'s weird because maybe it\'s an effect of reading Sanderson, but you\'re radiant with the light of Bridge 4 :). You\'re great at friendship, you know that? It\'s because you go way beyond the regular tickboxes of being a friend, and I feel like I can always rely on you. You bring a certain uniqueness (for lack of a better word) to any group, a breath of fresh air essential to complete any group. From being a frivolous bundle of energy lighting up faces to a thinker in deep thought, I\'ve seen you be it all. I sincerely appreciate you confiding in me on our Goa trip, and am honoured to have you reward me with your trust.
