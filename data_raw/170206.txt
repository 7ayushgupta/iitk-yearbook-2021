Those debates in antaragni, although sometimes frustrating, were a memorable experience. I respect you a lot for voicing your support for a cause and acting on it to make a difference. I think that\'s missing in many debaters, but you are an exception. Thanks a lot for introducing me to Medha and all the conversations I\'ve shared with you. I still blame you for coming up with the nickname kushy (Inshu still calls me that), but it\'s a small price to pay for getting to know you. We may have diverged on our paths beyond debsoc, but I hope I will find a friend in you whenever we meet.
