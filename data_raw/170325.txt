Humaari branches bhi different thi aur hall bhi. It was so unlikely that we\xe2\x80\x99d ever cross paths in these four years, but I am glad that we did, thanks to basketball. The first time I talked to you was on the basketball court during one of the CPA practice sessions. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk much in the first year but summer camp mai we became great friends (we\xe2\x80\x99ll always be great friends). \\n\\nBhai summer camp mere in 4 saalo mai sbse best time tha and you were one of the reasons for it. Summer camp ka time yaad krta hu to aisa lagta hai jaise camp koi sapna tha, kyunki hum us time bs khate, khelte aur soya krte the. But vo time bhut mst tha yar aur jo humaari team thi vo bhi sb mst bnde the. Acads ki wajah se basketball continue nhi kr paae 2nd year Udhgosh ke baad se but dost to humesha hi rahenge. Ek baar tu aur mai raat ko cycle pe nikle the campus mai ghoomne, kaafi baari oat mai party bhi ki aur kabhi kabhi tu Ujjwal se milne aaya krta tha hall to mulaakat ho jaati thi. Pr jitni mulaakat hui, km hui yar. But jitni bhi hui unhike lie mai grateful hu.\\n\\nFourth year mai same hall mai to reh nhi paae but jo 10 12 din March \xe2\x80\x9921 mai saath basketball khela, bhut accha laga. Aisa laga jaise we were reliving the whole Summer Camp experience again. Basketball khelne ka alag hi maza tha IITK mai. 1 1.5 ghanta jb court pe hote the, aisa lagta tha jaise apni saari problems kuch time ke lie gaayab hogyi ho. \\n\\nThankyou for all the experiences we had bhai. It has been so much fun to know you. I will miss you a lot. Terse baat krke humesha accha lagta tha because you used to listen so patiently. I wish you all the success in the world bhai. May you find your purpose and have a fulfilled and prosperous life. Stay healthy and happy. Take care bhai. Mst mst playlist share krte rehna. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in touch!\\n\\nP.S.
