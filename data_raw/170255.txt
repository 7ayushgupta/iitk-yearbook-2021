Thanks for taking me in your treasure hunt team lol, that night was a lot of fun..Team Disha woohoo! Unfortunately we didn\'t hang out a lot after that (despite the \'fake treats\') but yeah, Goa and RM were a lot of fun. Btw you really need to work on your Google maps navigation skills XD. The craziness in Goa was crazier, and the bitching in RM was extra spicy because of you! \\nP.S. - This one\'s to the photobombs in Thalassa!","author":"Kushagra  Gupta","visibility":true,"_id":"60c2368a659165b3aa645b73"},{"text":"Thank you for helping me out with some company processes while I was late( actually too late) for that. By the way, I hope your art course ended up well as I don\'t think I am that good with such stuff. Didn\'t get to talk to you so much but the time I got was worth it. You made my life so easy in all the company processes in which you were assigned with me as a CoCo. Hope our path will cross again, all the best for your future.\\n","author":"Ayush  Goel","visibility":true,"_id":"60c23ebf659165b3aa645c64"},{"text":"Kabhi mil ke bakchodi karni thi na yrr","author":"Nihal  Choudhary","visibility":true,"_id":"60c2508a659165b3aa645f6a"},{"text":"Yo! 1st year summers kya hi bakchodi krte the apan Utkarsh ke room me Descon ke naam P\xc3\xa9 par apna bridge sabse best thaaaa xD.

You were easily the most homesick person on our floor when we first came here. I remember you being so sad during our first week, that I had to bribe you with CCD food to cheer you up. But I am happy this place grew on you (So maybe Kanpur is not that bad after all? XD). I will never forgive you for making me watch Mean Girls on my birthday. First-year was filled with you bringing me up to speed on all the events of the week and sometimes month (thanks to my amazing schedule). And yes, I vividly remember stealing those letters from OAT. I still have those pictures lol. I am glad we got to hangout again in our last sem, especially our VH expedition lol. Hopefully, our intense gossip sessions and movie nights made up for all the hardships you faced on your long trips to my room, and next time we\xe2\x80\x99ll watch Cast Away for sure XD.

You stared Naruto while I was on Shippuden and you completed Shippuden while I was still on Shippuden. Well, I am still on Shippuden.

How did we even have a leg injury in the same leg at the same time? Glad for the time when I could skip PE with you. That specific knock-knock call of ours saved us some shouts there. Going to the canteen at what? 1:50 am since aj toh night out hai. Also, why have we watched such absurd movies together? Legally Blonde, My Cousin Rachel!! Should have just watched FRIENDS instead xD \\n\\nB204 had a vibe, from setting up those wall posters to drinking together. Thanks for getting rid of that lizard and in return I did the honors of scaring away those spiders. \\n\\nWe have shared a mutual love for Forever 21(budget zyada nahi hai apna xD).
