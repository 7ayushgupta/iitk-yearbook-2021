Takneek shall be ingrained in my heart, with you as my partner-in-crime.\\nThanks for sharing the burden as the quintessential Big Guy :)","author":"Tarish Tapan Sen","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf6969659165b3aa646682"},{"text":"Shivansh yaar!\\nEk tareeka hai ki ye memoir mai taarif se bhar dun. Aur mere paas yaha college ke kisi ladke/ladki se zyada material hoga. 6 saal ho gae na dost.\\nDusra tareeka hai ki khud ke liye jo filter out kiya hai tumhara dost hone se wo darj ker dun. \\nSL Canteen mei baithe the. Semester shayd 3rd hoga. Discussion mei baat nikalkar aayi aur tumne kaha ki jo kaam at hand hai wo mere se nhi chhoda jata irrespective of aage kya kerna hai. Aaj tk wo bhul nhi paya hu. Koi wajah nhi dikhti ki aage bhulunga. You are man of your word or like that famous saying \'Its not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me\'. Kitne kareeb ho iske tum.\\nTumhara trek ke liye wo gaand phaad mehnat kerna ho ya fir Takneek mei hall captain ban jana. Winning hall captain I should say. Just has motivated me to push for things and just try out. No matter what our inhibitions are. So you see tumse motivate hone ke liye I don\'t have to be around. Ek hostel dur se hi tum radiate kerte ho.\\nBio mei evolution ki baat likhi hai. So whosoever is reading that, lo mai yaha attest kerta hu ki iss bande ne wo kiya hai. From thar school guy who hardly find any solace in humans to this Shivanath who is leaving college with some really solid friendships. \\nJust to remind ye sab kuch tareef nhi hai. Observations hain. Ab agar tareef sound ker rhe to tum ho hi itne chaapu.\\nPeene tum lage ho, gilaas mai bhi uthane laga hu. Can\'t see a reason ki sath mei Jack Daniels lekar na baithein. Soch ke hi mazaa aa jata hai. To jaldi jaldi jo goals liye hain unhe niptao aur mahaul banao.\\n\\nFuture you ke liye yahi likhunga ki ise padhte rehna, I hope it works as a reminder for you if by any chance (even iota of it) tumhe lage ki cheezein man mutabik nhi ho rhi. \\nRest assured I don\'t see a reason of losing contact. Special thanks for all those efforts you make just to give a call on festivals. May this be a binding factor for us \'to not lose contact\'. Can\'t say what would happen if we stop celebrating festivals. Dekhte hain. Hopefully lamba jeeyein.\\nDher saara respect aur dher saara pyaar. Dost\\nTake care!","author":"Manish Chandra Yadav","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf726a659165b3aa6466cf"}]}]'
