Khair padhai likhai se door chalte hai kyuki yahan tum ulta mujhe inspire karti ho, aur bakchodi par wapas aate hai, I remember that unique exam of all the tharki boys you took in chemical freshers \\"Jisme hme 20 30 ladkiyon k naam btane the from our batch\\" and we all failed in that.

I remember you literally knowing everything about Skin Track, and I not know anything about it, but somehow I got through, and we got placed in the same team. That summer was fun: soldering circuits, building electrodes, checking 80 MHz oscillators, learning to code ESP8266, and then subsequently coding it a million times over and dealing with the male and female headers :P, and of course, dealing with our arrogant team leader (I hope you remember :P). To be honest, you were the most motivated among all of us to do the project, and it is because of you only that it ever got completed. In hindsight, that was the project that got me the internship eventually, so I guess I have a lot to be thankful to be you. You are literally the most helpful person I know and, above all a special friend. Thank you for overlooking the times when I have been indifferent to you, and thank you for always cracking me up with your pronunciation of Github :P and also choosing Cult meet over Tech meet in winter \'18 :D. Always stay the same, never change, and stop pulling my leg so often :P. Wish we stay connected in the future.\\nAll the best.","author":"Anirudh  Garg","visibility":false,"_id":"60a976c4819323d199d49427"},{"text":"Yo Jaya!\\nRemember how we discussed our common allergies the first time we talked during CPA trials. \\nKnocking on each other\'s door anytime to discussing random doubts, you are no doubt an unforgettable part of my UG journey at IITK.\\nI absolutely admire your focus and dedication and I know you\'re gonna achieve a lot in life.\\nGood luck and stay in touch <3","author":"Deeksha  Yadav","visibility":false,"_id":"60aaa159659165b3aa644d4a"},{"text":"Hi bro,\\nKafi hardworking insaan ho tum, itna ki bas ek hi cheez pe focus karoge chahe duniya meh baki sab ulta kyu na hojaye.
