We were together for the Young Scientist exam coaching class by Kotwal ma\'am. After that, we joined Vidyalankar for Physics Olympiad classes.  Are you in touch with our mutual friends from Vidyalankar? \\n\\nYou were the coordinator of the coolest club in SnT council. I remember the night that I spent in Astro club when collaborating for a SnT council proposal.\\nThanks for allowing Eclub to conduct one of our secys meets at Astro club.\\nI wish that I could have spent more time at Astro Club.\\n\\nIt is great that you pursued your liking towards Physics and Astronomy at IIT K. I recall that you had medals in Astronomy Olympiads before joining college. Although I don\'t know much about astronomy, radio astronomy sounds cool as it has a bit of intersection with electrical engineering. I recall that you too, had collaborated with the Microwave lab in EE for one of your projects. \\n\\nPhysics and electrical engineering have a good amount of intersection. Hopefully, our paths might cross again in the future.\\n\\nIf you are in Thane, we might meet up sometime.\\n\\nAll the best for your future endeavors.\\n\\n\\n","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":false,"_id":"60a67f38819323d199d49083"}]}]'
