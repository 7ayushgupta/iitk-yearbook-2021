The most fun memory for me is Bangalore - ekdum wheeeeee karte hue cycle chalayi thi towards the mall xD. I loved the trips we went on as well - holi on your house\'s rooftop and Udaipur. Here\'s to the good times! All the best!","author":"Naishadh Nimesh Parmar","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf7d74659165b3aa646765"},{"text":"Hey! DON\'T put this up as a memoir but here\'s a few things I wanted to say, and I don\'t feel like writing them on chat. Pehle to please forgive me for the memoir I wrote..I\'ve been writing for a long time now and I\'m just exhausted and emotionally drained. I know there\'s no excuse to not write the best memoir for someone as amazing as you, and be sure that I will definitely make up for it in the US. I wish I had pinched myself and exhausted my tears, because your memoir has made my eyes very blurry for some reason. I\'ve met a lot of wonderful people in IITK, but honestly, none like you. If you could see yourself from my eyes, you\'d that you\'re one in a billion (nope, definitely rarer). I was stuck on a problem for the longest time while thinking of what to write for you - what is it that makes you so precious, that makes you that perfect friend? I still haven\'t found the answer. I\'ve been friends with people longer, I\'ve had life-changing moments and conversations with others too,  I\'ve also poured my heart out to close friends, but it\'s just not the same, just not as special as it is with you. Ok, I\'ve decided. There\'s just no logical explanation for it. You don\'t have to understand me the best, or mirror my thoughts, or always support me. As long as you\'re yourself, as long as we have all those memories behind us, you\'ll be a special friend. I\'ve never doubted you once. Hell, I\'ve been more confident in you than I\'ve been in myself. I\'m telling you there\'s something special about you, something heartwarming, something brilliant, something we don\'t have a word for! Your secrets are always safe with me, I can\'t even imagine breaking your trust. And I apologize in advance if ever my jokes hurt you, or I\'m unable to reciprocate your love and care. If I ever make these mistakes, please don\'t keep them to yourself. I promise to hear you out, make amends, and never repeat that mistake ever again. Your friendship is just too special to lose.
