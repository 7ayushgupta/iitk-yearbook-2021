hardworking, phodu and yet down-to-earth guy on campus. Bhai itna kuchh common rha hai ki I don\'t even know if there is any point of writing this. But, to start off, Mech and SnT me kaam kiya and karte dekha which was a bliss for me. Intern day 1 hamesha yaad rahega mujhe, there liye samosa leke aaya that before your HUL interview xD and what a way to get a Day 1 Intern! Hats off to your dedication bhai. I\'ve always admired your work and you, as a person. Itna chaapu and yet humble insaan nhi dekha bhai. EE650 me collaborate karna, Intern time pe discussions on projects and Interrobang further ahead, all in all a great experience by the closure. On campus bhi mil liye bhai, last bye bolne ka chance bhi mil gya (Send me that first and last pic of ours agar hai there paas toh xD). GSoc bhi clear and dual me bhi chaap rha ab! Research and robotics have been my passion and something that you are doing (always have been!) and isiliye I\'m sure ki aage baat toh hoti rahegi. After all, there\'s still a lot to learn from you. Keep up the undying enthu that you have. Keep replying you my FB stories :p, and treats pending hai bhai! Cheers and all the best for everything to come.

Jab 1st year mein pehli baar Hall 12 canteen mein mila tha tab tumhara robotics ka enthu aur energy dekh ke inferiority complex aa gaya tha bhai XD\\n3rd year ke winters mein jo tune aur Faizan ne bachcho ke liye session liya tha usse mujhe bhi itni saari cheeze pata chali thi <3 People like you are the main reason why SnT culture is flourishing in IITK. (PS: To the best of my knowledge, current Y19 ke chaaro coordis ne 1st year mein tera session attend kiya tha)\\nSo thanks a lot for being a constant well-wisher of Robotics Club and being an integral part of the Roboclub family in our 3rd year as well!\\nITC/HUL internship interviews ke time Outreach building mein sabse zyada tere saath discussion hua tha. Dono ki intern lag gayi thi tab bohot achcha laga tha <3 \\nAll the Best for everything ahead man!
