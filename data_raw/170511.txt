I remember our first meet during when Tejas came to visit us in our rooms. And my first impression has that you were quite a secluded person. Man! I was so wrong!! Imagine my surprise finding out that not only did you score a double dassa, but all those nights that you were missing in our wing, you were utilising to the fullest, be it club engagements, hanging out and meeting new people, expanding your social circle (much more than any of us did) and what not! (But your major missing also led to a deprivation of interactions and fun we could have had, which I ain\'t forgiving you for anytime soon -.-). Always been a big fan of how you managed your time so freakin well. Not just acads but research, chilling and ofc your relationships with people. And knowing where exactly you come from, I am always amazed by your sense of maturity and the hard work you put in to overcome all odds and reach greater heights, irrespective of how bad the situation may actually be in real life.
