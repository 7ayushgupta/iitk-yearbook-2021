Everybody lies!\\n\\nI don\'t know about how we met, but, I for one, am sure you are the one of those who will stick forever. For the longest time, It blew my mind how content you were with life. I would always look for a way to grab a fraction of it for myself. But now, I\'ve come to a happy realization that it\'s just what you have made of yourself\xe2\x80\x94a consequence of your hard work and a testament to your will. You\'re the very definition of discipline and the epitome of things that one can achieve through it. That aside, you\'re a wonderful and joyous human being.\\n\\nI can count back a box load of things that we have done/shared all this while. Psychology classes/assignments/projects with Devpriya sir, Vibing over House and Sherlock, Udaipur trips and treats, Our campus exploration tour that ended in free coffee at Flexi, staying at my home a bunch of times, walks, talking in the most cryptic ways, bowling trips in Kanpur. I wonder whether I shouldn\'t have told you who was stealing your door plants. Memoir would\'ve been a fantastic place to reveal it. Honestly, it can\'t be enumerated. It feels like you\'ve been a part of every other thing in my life. That says volumes about us. You\'re more than a friend; you\'re family. There isn\'t much more to say about it. \\n\\nI\'m not going to lay down more of what we have done here. I\'ll leave that for us to reminisce over coffees in the future. Instead, I\'ll have you know that my respect and admiration for you is beyond anyone else. You always make me feel like I can talk to you about anything and at any time. I can always count on you that way. There are days I am at a loss for words, and today sure as hell feels like one. I don\'t know how we became such good friends, but I felt like we had a unique connection between us, unfazed by situations I fell into. \\n\\nYou\'re super brilliant, and you excel at everything you do! I cannot wrap my brain around it. All this time together, yet you remain a mystery to me. I would have loved to know more, whatever more was there to learn. I wish you talked to me about things when they weren\'t right for you, as I did numerous times with you. Enjoy your incredible success; you have earned it. Know that I\'m always around the corner (quite literally too XD!).

The trek back on the railway tracks in Goa was like the first story session with you. You tell stories with the greatest passion. We have talked about Mafia strategies, lol. Sweep and your glittery cards in CCD were fun. Also, need to know more about that value system. That argument in Goa over who will be riding pillion with Avisha though. \\n\\nAnd, Captain America >>> Iron Man \\nAb toh WhatsApp wallpaper change kar le. \\n\\nSee you in Gurgaon, excited for some weird-ass discussions over water, or maybe I will convince you for a drink, who knows.
