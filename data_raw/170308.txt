I still remember those lines, jab pehli baar me aapse mila deviji. \\nSahi me man to kar rha tha wahi bot hi uthake mooh pe maar do :P But anyways, uske baad to me sahi hi kata h shayad sab :P, though mooh todne ki icha to aye din hoti rehti thi apni ek dusre ka XD. Sanda, inchupinchu, kya kya to naam nahi die tujhe XD, but mene fraudi nahi bulaya kabhi, though tu thi XD. Anyways, I\'ve always been hating you, and would continue to XD kiddin :P.Kafi incidents h waise to yaha likhne ke lie, but kya hi likhu, as usual, jaise tune likha, time kam h :P. Shayad tu NFS me beech me ghusi thi, on some pity manner, but i dont  really remember group kaise ban gaya apna XD, and fir to bante hi gaye XD. But all that happens, happens for good. Little did I know itni achi dost milne wali thi, jise \\"GIFTS LENA PASAND H XD\\" (Casually tagging saini here). I wish I could have written ki kya trip this apni, but pity me I did not ever have a trip with you, so this one is pending :P (Wait, does ganga barrage count in? :P). Btw, Parv is still interested, to boldu ki \\"IITK KI SABSE HOT BANDI IS AVAILABLE XD\\" (Sarcasm for the general peeps XD)\\n\\nBut ha, thank you for everything, me acha communicator to nahi, but ye perfect place h genuine wala thank you likhne ke lie. Thanks for accepting the wierdness in me, and believe me ki mujhse virutal nahi hota bhai, me nahi badla XD, halat badle h. And pardon me for a bad memoir, but I dont think I can do justice to this writeup in so less time, we have a plethora of incidents to write about, anyways, better that we call often to relive the memoir :P. Aur BC chutia tareeke see texts karna band kar, aur call laga lia kar aisi situation me, L koi texts nahi dekhta XD (ykwim). And also, stop lying and hiding stuff from me, ik mujhse hi cheeze sabse kam share hoti h, aur chupai jati h, but ek baar try to karke dekh XD, nahi to khabrio se sab info nikal jati h XD. And ik I have promised to keep, and things to sort, but wait kare time aur agle episode of life (and if time permits, memoir ) ka XD. \\n\\nYours,\\nOne to not expect from\\nFake Friend\\n","author":"Nitik  Jain","visibility":true,"_id":"60cce909659165b3aa6463b1"},{"text":"Yo animated movies partner!\\nIt has been great to know you Inshu! We first met when apan roboclub tshirt design karne ki team mein the. Tshirt to nahi bani thi, but those were fun times XD Of course, tumhare saath Ralph Breaks the Internet dekhna yaad hai mujhe. Movie to bohot achchi thi hi <3 (One of my all-time favourites), but uske baad campus mein tumhare saath ghumne mein bhi bohot mazaa aaya tha. That was the first time mai campus gate se hostels tak chalke aaya, only because of the amazing company I had <3\\nAlso, thanks a lot for being a constant well-wisher of Robotics Club and being an integral part of the Roboclub family in our 3rd year as well! Tumhara SnT ke liye enthu aur drive alag level hai. You have my mad respect for that. Bohot kuch seekhne ko mila us time.\\nPS: I am a bigger fan of animated movies than you are :) \\nI hope that we meet again soon. All the Best for everything ahead!","author":"Neil Rajiv Shirude","visibility":true,"_id":"60cee6eb659165b3aa64650f"},{"text":"Glad we met!\\nHonesty likhu to first meet per bhi nhi laga ki hum pehli baar mil rhe. Either it was your vibe or we did connect organically. Can\'t say sahi kaun sa hai. Will have to see how you vibe with others on your first meet :P\\nWell, not every effort\'s success is to be measured via the end result. Many a times process itself is quite regarding. You deciding to contest was one such decision.  Else mujhe to koi intersecting paths nhi dikh rhe the yaar.\\nHonestly likhu to tumhare sath aane ka main reason yahi tha ki you were challenging the status quo at so many levels. Team-club, SnT mei girl candidate and what not. Would love and be satisfied if you promise to carry this along in your other pursuits too. Some big ones. Possible hua to fir saath aa jaunga. \\nMilne ki ek tamanna hai jo badi lambi hai. Isse hi excitement build ho jata ki kitna kuch hoga humare paas baat kerne ko.  Tum bhi thodi excitement dikha dena yaar. Milte rehna. \\nZindagi lambi hai(hopefully). It\'s good to have people around jo ek above par buzz de dete hon milne per. Tumhare sath wo raha. Dont wanna lose that.\\nBest wishes Inshu\\nRock kerti raho!","author":"Manish Chandra Yadav","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf67a6659165b3aa646673"},{"text":"Hello from your \\"Dhokebaaz friend\\"\\n\\nSorry for the elections. Let\'s start fresh from Bangalore xD. \\nBahut late interaction hua par koi khafa nahi hain, kyoki jaa toh same hi jagah rahe hai colleage. Waha pr toh aur bhi memoir ke kisse likhenge. \\n\\nCheers dost, apan toh waise bhi \\"J\\" break pr office mein bahut se kisse discuss karenge hi college ke!\\n\\n","author":"Yadu  Sharma","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf7276659165b3aa6466d0"}]}]'
