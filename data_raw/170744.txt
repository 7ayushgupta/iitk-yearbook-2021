Obviously, at the time, you were not there to meet me, but I gradually lured you away with food. We spent our first year practically together all the time. You taught me ESC and TA, and I tried (and failed) to teach you how to walk. Our time was mostly spent oscillating between our rooms and club, adjusting to the new environment, and juggling sleepless nights with neverending quizzes. But in the middle of all the rush, I got to know the gem of a person you are -- always loyal to, and ready to go above and beyond for the people you care about. And I am fortunate to have had such a person by my side all these years.\\n\\nWe had fun over the silliest things. Setting up camp under the club table, randomly texting people together, losing our mind over that bible app - half the things we did made no sense lol. I fail to understand how you never messed up a complex task but the simplest things are beyond you. Seriously, who swerves into a tree so far away from the road! And obviously, your iconic walk, constantly pushing me off the sidewalk, you lil piece of shit. But for all that, you\xe2\x80\x99ve put up with a LOT of my antics, whether it was letting me play Pokemon Go on a freezing January night, my very long hair routine, or using you as a shield against the scary campus dogs every day.

You always had my back and never hesitated to stand up for me. I love how you get angry at every person I am annoyed with, even more so than me on several occasions.
