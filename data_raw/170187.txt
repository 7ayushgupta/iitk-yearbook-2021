Ayush has always been conscious of the environment, leading the \'khulle mei hagna band karo\' campaign in IITK and going as far as dressing campus dogs with diapers. His social initiatives have been a constant source of inspiration, with his efforts to iron S Ghorai\xe2\x80\x99s pants every day in MTH102 even prompting the teacher to wear the same pants daily (unwashed mind you). As a \xe2\x80\x98responsible\xe2\x80\x99 citizen of India, he made 69 arrests on valentine\xe2\x80\x99s day with the \xe2\x80\x98anti-Romeo squad\xe2\x80\x99. He even volunteered as a day labourer for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Ayush has been an active resident of the campus, he bought the most Bournvita from DOSA and used it to run the \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a Complan boy\xe2\x80\x99 campaign. We will never forget his efforts in eliminating the national threat of Akash Anand\xe2\x80\x99s pet birds and his generous donation of hair on Word Blood Donor day. His achievements in writing the best Hindi \xe2\x80\x98nibandh\xe2\x80\x99 in ELS poetry slam and the national record he set for treating cycle punctures have made him immortal in the annals of history. Ayush has made an indelible impact on numerous young minds with his \xe2\x80\x98Kalbelia\xe2\x80\x99 performance in Y18 orientation and his famous debate sessions on \xe2\x80\x98Mayawati vs Chhipkali\xe2\x80\x99. His research output for the institute is invaluable, with his latest experiment on producing mutant \xe2\x80\x98nilgai\xe2\x80\x99 called \xe2\x80\x98piligai\xe2\x80\x99 (by painting them yellow, naturally) creating ripples in the scientific community.

Sometimes people fail to see your vision, but it doesn\'t matter because you always come through in the end.\\nYou are a keeper. Everything about you speaks of it. You love making everything around you beautiful, whether it\'s your room or your relationships. I have no doubts that where ever you go, you will make the place and people your very own.\\nYour instincts are always so spot on. You follow them in the most natural ways. \\nI know we had our fair share of tough times when we misunderstood each other and hurt each other. But, know that the people who care about each other the most hurt each other the most. Of course, that\'s not an excuse, but I hope you know it all never came from a bad place. \\nTalking to your day and night became the routine, and I didn\'t realise when we started sharing so much about ourselves. I opened up about my insecurities, weaknesses, and weird thoughts to you so quickly. I didn\'t hold back from telling you my weird habits, silly questions, and even saying gibberish stuff to make you go jeez (damm, that was quite a phase :P).\\nI remember how we used to have silly fights and leg-pulling about the most random stuff. \\"Yeh kachra hai\\" or \\"kachra kardiya\\" I loved getting those reactions out of you. \\nNobody can replace you in my life and what you have been to me. Your kindness, politeness and all the lame adjectives can go out the window now. You are just A-you-sh and A-them-sh (yes, this will haunt you forever xD).\\nThanks for always being there for me, standing up for me, cheering for me, supporting me in ways I would never know and just being my friend who hates dogs as much as me.\\nLove you <33\\n\\nPS: Also, my music suggestions subscription did not come with an expiry date, so keep them coming :D\\nPPS: Please change your plans to die on the aeroplane if you remember!\\n","author":"Avisha","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf6dd8659165b3aa6466b0"},{"text":"Hey \xc3\x80yush one of the biggest mondler fan out there.

We haven\'t talked a lot, but whenever we did I always felt like an immediate connection. Some topics that I have rarely found anyone to relate with, I could relate with you and one of them was New York City of course! Apni ek US road trip pending rahi boss! That Bryan Adams concert I\'ll remember for a long time to come, it was so much fun vibing to all those songs. Hope we meet soon and all the best!
