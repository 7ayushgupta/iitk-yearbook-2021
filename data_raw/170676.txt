You all talk too much, you waste words and time. You\'re a distraction to what actually matters and more often than not you\'re detracting from the world, not adding to it with your insightful conversations.\\n\\nNow I don\'t blame you for it, I don\'t think me better. But I do not want to talk to you, I do not need to talk to you. I enjoy myself more without the empty words being exchanged. My extrovert partner? We have comfortable silences with entire conversations taking places with looks, squeezes of the hand, and facial expressions.\\n\\nSomething you consider awkward might not feel that way to me, while your natural flowing conversation feels forced. If I wanted to share something with you I would, but honestly I probably wouldn\'t find it often necessary and when I did it\'s not some word shattering revelation it simply something I found worth saying in the same way you find all the words you use worth saying.\\n\\nNo more important, no less.\\n\\nIt feels like you find the silence awkward and blame that awkwardness on the individual. When really they\'re likely comfortable with it and find the conversation awkward. If I wanted to talk to someone I would, it\'s not introversion that would stop me from having a conversation it would be anxiety and to me that\'s something else entirely.","author":"Harish  Dechiraju","visibility":false,"_id":"6078b374c5325f8b69d16a57"},{"text":"\\"Badminton lover, slightly maggu, shy and dumb\\", you forgot to add a \\"liar\\" in between :p","author":"Pulkit  Pandey","visibility":false,"_id":"607c8d48b38952bbfbc68d0e"},{"text":"Mera spam comment hata dia \xf0\x9f\x98\xa1\\n\\nAnyways, one of the few people on campus, jinse randomly baat karke bhi chehre pe muskaan aa jaati hai ;)\\n\\nJyaada \\"fun\\" moments toh share kiye nahi, but still a good friend, would miss you. \xf0\x9f\xa5\xb2","author":"Harish  Dechiraju","visibility":true,"_id":"6084a9d5819323d199d46dae"},{"text":"Ohh bhai saari photos mere saath ki hi....

Can proudly claim ki aaj bhi contact name same hai. \\nI have always felt that apna bond bahut special raha hai even though we have had months where we didn\'t talk. Thats how family is right. You don\'t have to make efforts to preserve it.\\nSome of the things which I really admire you for- \\nIt was this 2nd semester when you started those daily visits to CC just to practice coding. Shayd esc101 grades se satisfied nahi the tum. It would be around 5 in the evening jab mai CPA ke liye ready hota tha aur tumhe cycle utha ke jaate dekhta tha. Never said it to the face but that solo act did inspire me to push hard in other things I got involved with in life. \\nSecondly, I just love how you are so loyal to your badminton racket. Things have gone upside down but tumne SAC visits nhi chhode. I have this feeling that \'commitment\' is your forte, be it whatever playing field you choose. \\nI am glad that \'CSE fever\' tumhe nhi chadha unlike many of our batchmates. \\n[You are just superb at mafia.

How all your communication skills just open up and I see a new jagga around. Wit aur spontaneity pata nahi kahan se aa jati hai. Privileged that I know this side of you unlike many others. \\nHaving said all this I really regret that you went to a different wing. I wish I could have done something to prevent it. \\nChalo bhai, ab vida leta hun. Be the perfect mix of maturity and innocence that your are. Tumhara liye bahut sara pyaar. \\nYaad aaye to connect ki koshish kerte rehna. Mujhe to aayegi.
