We got into a petty fight and then one walk changed everything. I have got many defining moments from being with you and learnt a lot about life. You broaden my perspective. I have had 21 birthdays till now, but no one did anything special compared to what you did, you made me feel special that day with your excellent craft skills. Delhi ki wo trip humesha yaad rhegi, but the best time would undoubtedly be the time we spent in Mumbai. I hope you remember the horse ride. But above the big things in life, I value the small things we had, especially the painting of minions which I had to complete as you were not that good a painter. And also, the little notes you used to leave for me at unexpected places. It was a new experience for me to be in a relationship and I realised that it was the thing that was missing because I got you, you completed my life in the campus. Fire department ke saath waala incidence to main kabhi nhi bhulunga, aur na hi marine drive pe wo baithna, jaha aisa laga ki waqt ruk hi jaata to achha hota. Kaafi competitive spirit hai tujhme jo lifelong maintain rakhna hai (in a healthy way *wink*). We spent a lot of time in many different places. Kabhi RM, kabhi library, kabhi GH, but the best was the skywalk, and a close second is the Earth Science building. Wo road bhi achhi hai jo library se RM tak jaati hai. I respect you for the progress you have made since the first year. Poori journey kaafi achhi rahi but I still wish we had met earlier and got more time in the campus.
