Electronics ki choice thoda improve kar, cooler almost hair-dryer jaisa tha, laptop ki screen alag ho gayi, headphones kharaab ho gaye, wonder where those hours of research go.

I can\'t even recall all the memories we\'ve had. From the day in orientation when I heard you are from Champaran (tere Dadaji toh Gandhiji se mile honge \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b) to the day we left IITK, its been an amazing journey. PHY103 main second row main sone se ESC201 attendance ke liye subah 7:58 par cycle bhagaane ka mazaa hi kuch aur tha. First year summers main Olympic-size swimming pool ke maze bhi le hi liye. Aur NCC jake Frooti aur Parle-G lene wale din bhi yaad rahenge \xf0\x9f\xa5\xba\xef\xb8\x8f.\\nExams ke beech main aake seedha overwatch main lag jana, just because woh free tha \xf0\x9f\x98\x86. Khali campus main raat main andhera karke Resident Evil khelna, Fortnite main noobs ki tarah harna, Apex, PUBG, aur ab Valorant, bhut games saath main enjoy kre hain. Second year main toh na jaane kitni cheezon par baat ki. Canteen aur mess main toh hamesha saath hi jaate. Roz raat late tak jaagna. Ek doosre ko classes ke liye uthana. Aur teri breakfast krne ki aadat toh alag hi hai. Aur kuch mile na mile, breakfast zaroor krna hai \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b.\\nYou\'ve been my go-to friend for everything. Chahe woh Dhim__ ki MLM scheme ho (eBiz \xf0\x9f\x98\x82), koi news, koi reddit post, koi video game, Pewdiepie vs t-series drama \xf0\x9f\x98\x85, China+COVID ki conspiracies, courses ke discussions, internships, companies & placements, idhar-udhar ki bitching, na jaane kitne discussions kre hain humne. Third year main bhi room ke bahar bulla hi kaat-te rehte the. COVID aane ke baad bhi ye continued rhe, thanks to Valorant and Whatsapp. Goa trip bhi hamesha yaad rahegi \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d. So many memories made. Aur teri negotiation skills ke toh kya hi kehne. 200->150 Rs ka umbrella (1st year) se lekar 200->140 ki hat tak (Goa trip), your skills have remained the same \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b. Woh 6 Rs ki ghadi toh pta nhi kaha gayab ho gyi, aur tera cooler bhi xD.\\nAur ab toh crypto main bhi ghusa diya (halaki pta nhi current dip kab recover hogi \xf0\x9f\x98\x85), tips dete rehna. I really like how calm you stay, and how you control your temper, never seen you get too angry. Hopefully jaldi hi fir milne ka mauka milega. I know you will do great things in life. I am glad to share my IITK journey with you.
