Got to know you from 3rd year majorly and then when we both converted to Dual, dosti gehri bn gyi. I remember how you pushed me to solve Thermo problems in detail cuz tu exam see pehle puchhega and then bta nhi paaya toh khudko bura lgega. Indirectly you have made me a better student in terms of solving more problems and doing more practice before exams to prevent mistakes. Also I expect tu aage rona dhona thoda km krega and I sincerely want you to continue being an ethical (which is very hard in these times honestly) and morally sound person that you are.

The only good thing that came out of that simulation course was that I gained some really good friends (you included obviously). From having the impression that you\xe2\x80\x99re quite a serious and studious person, to actually knowing what an incredibly fascinating and fun loving (who loves pulling pranks) and hard working and strong-willed human being you really are, we have definitely come a long way. All those long walks, canteen trips, extensive discussions where you were the one doing most of the talking (and I was happy listening) and many more such memories that I can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly list down here, will all always be cherished. \\nWell, your PJs, academic rona dhona, messed up logics and a dozen more cringe things that you (and I both) fail to recall, definitely struck a chord in my symphony and so you better do that all over again. Glad we have one more year for that !\\nP.S. You are one of the \xe2\x80\x98sabse sahi\xe2\x80\x99 people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met.\\nP.P.S.

I have always received help from you whenever I asked and learnt some very important things from the discussions with you.
