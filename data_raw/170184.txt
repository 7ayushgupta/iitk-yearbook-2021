We cheated a lot and it was you who helped me with assignments, especially for PHY473A and CS641A. I was a loner, kept a few friends and preferred working alone. But now when I look back, since May 7, 2020, we have been in continuous touch. I never imagined I would take courses with someone and would have such a great time working with him. People\xe2\x80\x99s lives are mostly spent in work and as they say, \xe2\x80\x9cHaving a friend in the workplace will make your day brighter.\xe2\x80\x9d, you did make the last two sems more lively, filled with laughter and fun.\\nAur haan, you taught me how to help completely and not partially, giving it your all, without bringing self-interest in between.
