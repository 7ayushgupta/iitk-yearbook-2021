That night in Goa, seeing you cry broke my heart because a person like you doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to cry at all. And yeah I\'m going to try to remember the things bhand you said to me, and I\'m gonna try to soak them up in my life too. I\'m gonna miss just discussing mundane day-to-day things with you and just as easily discussing family lives and life decisions. I\'m crappy at the phone call thing but I\'ll always pick up yours. I\'m always one text or one call away from you, always remember that. Chapu tu hai hai, robo God, you\'ll excel at Minnesota as you have at IITK, all the best for that. And yes keep the reels coming :P Love you <3\\nP.S. Ab please maaf karde Mocha kaand ke liye? Ham donon ko :P\\n\\n","author":"Ananya  Goswami","visibility":true,"_id":"60c4ece2659165b3aa64628e"},{"text":"BYE","author":"Ananya  Goswami","visibility":true,"_id":"60c4efe0659165b3aa646297"},{"text":"Same city, same coaching.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this observation is correct or not, but I think the most beautiful thing about you is that you find your motivation within yourself. Your resolve to keep growing and learning new things on the way is astounding. You have constantly pushed yourself during these last four years, and it has been nothing but impressive to watch that. \\n\\nThere were times when I would come to CCD and rant to you for hours about tiresome social situations.
