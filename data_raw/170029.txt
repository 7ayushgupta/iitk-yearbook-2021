Your hairstyle and hair accessories were soo famous :p \\nI still remember celebrating your birthday in the canteen during the first year winter break. Also that NSS painting drive when we were just sort of busy taking pictures :p\\nSecond-year Saini was the most dedicated person that I saw. Your dedication towards Robo Club was amazing. I still remember that late-night discussion about Robo Club Marketing where you told me about your plans for the club. \\nThird-year Saini was just so different, you gained so much maturity (though still a chhapri nibba :p) Third year Saini was ke saath sabse zyada maze kiye- be it sharing Techkriti BT or discussing our issues. Devendra-Piyush ke room pe aake bakchodi karna, pizza khana were all part of this fun.
