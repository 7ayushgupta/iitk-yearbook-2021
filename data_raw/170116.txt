You\'ve been masturbating for one hour now, yet you still haven\'t came and your penis is beginning to absorb your saliva, becoming a sticky, burning hot rod. Furiously, you begin to accelerate your masturbation rapidly. By two hours, your cock is burning in pain yet there is not a single drop of cum - not even precum.\\n\\nMeanwhile, next door, a girl is masturbating too, on stream, but they can\'t reach orgasm. In desperation, the girl has resorted to using multiple dildos inside her pussy, but even that is no use. The girl then makes a makeshift sex machine from a dildo and an electric power tool - once again, this is futile. She punches her pillow in defeat.\\n\\nBy three hours, you\'ve given up trying to cum and gone downstairs to watch more anime. However, upon seeing an anime girl fall over and have a panty shot, you feel the need to cum again. Biting your arm to lead the the pain away from your penis, you rapidly masturbate. By four hours, you\'re screaming as your rough masturbation soon rips the skin cells off your dick. Your cock is now a burning red giant, but there is no cum left - any precum that was there has evaporated.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the girl screams too - not because of finally reaching orgasm, but because they\'ve gone so long without one that they\'ve resorted to anything. Rapidly pushing the small cactus in and outside of herself, the girl\'s toe curl on bed sheets as blood flows out from her vaginal entrance. body spasming in pain - but still, she does not orgasm. The world is getting even more desperate.\\n\\nSuddenly, you get a discord notification from a friend, saying they\'ve been trying to cum to Dream x George fanfiction, but they\'ve ended up making their cock a, quote, \\"burning red giant.\\" Your eyes open in shock horror - it can\'t be, can it? You rush to the television to ask your waifu how to resolve this mystery when you find that the TV has replaced the anime with an emergency government announcement - there\'s a new disease preventing orgasms... and its contagious. You feel as if you\'re about to faint, quickly looking up if there\'s a cure - there is none. You screech in anger, knowing that your waifu will never love you if you can\'t pour semen all over a shitty print out of her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the girl cries, double fisting her bleeding self as she shrieks in rage, desperate to orgasm. What on Earth can a female do in life if they cannot orgasm? The girl is realising her chatterbate viewers are going down - she needs this orgasm. Realising that there is no hope, she illogically becomes even more desperate, suddenly barging into her brother\'s room, who is lying naked on the floor, dick ripped off next to a knife; the disease has claimed its first victim. She shoves the dick in her pussy, crying as the lactic acid burns her arm as she rapidly accelerates her brother\'s dethatched cock in and out, but it\'s no use: she has the disease.\\n\\nSuddenly, both of them stop. There\'s a large siren and a warning appears on the televisions of every house in the world, \\"There is no more cum.\\" The world quickly devolves and you hear a car crash into your house. Out of nowhere, a man grabs you by the neck, desperately shoving his cock in your ass in the need of cum, raping you. Yet, it\'s no use - the man has the disease, and so do you. Luckily, there\'s a gun to the side and you manage to pry the discord moderator off, before killing him.\\n\\nGiven a few weeks, society practically doesn\'t exist - it\'s like the apocalypse. Crime rates have skyrocketed as people loot dildo shops. The hospitals are beginning to crumble as more and more women show up with more and more exotic accidents. Meanwhile men are being completely taken over by their horniness: a female reporter is stood outside, reporting where the disease was first reported, and you feel the urge. You and the cameraman both turn on her trust, stripping her down and savagely pummelling her, but it\'s not use - you can not cum. The woman shouts, enraged too, for she can not orgasm either. Children in high school are to scared to go outside and you don\'t blame them, knowing what sickening lows you may succumb too once this disease truly takes control. Other children, who had already been on discord and thus knew about sex thanks to the moderators, have began spiralling into madness too - high schools have become orgies, with devastating costs to the countries IQ, you think.\\n\\nEighty years pass and the human population plummets. Listening to Prokofiev\'s \\"Death of Tybalt\\" in your asylum room, you attempt to masturbate one more time. Unbeknownst to you, your the last human on the planet. Entire families have killed each other, each one raping the others corpse, foolishly believing from online sources that necrophilia was the cure. Men and women have killed themselves in spectacular accidents, dying in human crushes as hundreds of orgy-goers suffocate naked. Young teenagers have formed sex cults, praying to bizarre dank memes whilst furiously fucking each other in the hope that somehow, a fucking meme removes the symptoms of a disease. Like you thought, the IQ of the general population has lowered. However, you know better, you know there\'s no cure so you separated yourself from the idiots, hiding away in this asylum with a few staff who have recently died too... And you still can\'t cum. Wailing in sadness, you scratch and tear at your cock, wishing it to hell. Eventually, with enough force, you rip your sexual organ clean off and force it into your metal handcuffs.\\n\\n\\"What\'s this?\\" You think - it worked. The handcuffs are unlocked. You look outside to the asylum balcony. You can finally escape this petty world. \\"How men and women have fallen so far.\\" You think, \\"To go from civil creatures to savage beasts, killing and raping everything in their path.\\" You shake your head, thinking of the NatGeoWild documentaries you used to watch about savage apes. With a curse to the sky, the disease claims it\'s last life as the host throws itself off the balcony. Human life is gone and now, the disease has become animal born too. A few thousand years pass and there are no complex life forms at all...\\n\\nThere\'s no more cum left on Earth.","author":"Mahajan Dipak Anil","visibility":false,"_id":"60ba19fd659165b3aa644fb4"},{"text":"*nose emoji* \\n100% of the classes mein soya hi hua paya jane wala launda hai yeh pranni.

I am pretty sure if I start writing toh SnT ki chutiya website ki limit cross ho jayegi. Lets give it one more shot because we both have always been good at doing work close to the deadline.\\nAs you know, everything I achieved at IITK mujhe hamesha meri aukaat se zyada laga hai and hence I have always been grateful for everything I got (even if in hindsight), but the thing I am most grateful to IITK for is you dude. \\n\'Hamara naam Anirudh hai\' is how it all started. From a typical CSE maggu to a fucking all-rounder in its literal terms is how everyone sees it, I feel so privileged to know the back stories behind all the output that everyone sees. My phone gallery speaks volumes about how big a part of my life you have been for the past four years, starting from those sleeping photos in Hall CC during Takneek to those ESC101 so called night outs extending all the way to Goa pics and beyond. \\nMnP managers vaali Antaragni kitni litt thi, you behaving like a kid, roaming all around the place, begging Shrey for apology hahaha. Funnily, some of the moments I have had with you are the ones jo tujhe yaad bhi nahi honge :P - Ramaiya mein Chitranshu ko galiyana, Sis guard ko galiyana, events ground ke mid mein sona and many more. \\nOne thing which I can\'t be more thankful to you for, is taking me to Debsoc. Haha, countless nights spend ki hai discussing Debsoc and its fuck ups. Voh Balluu ke room pe jo night out hua tha discussing/shouting about everything uffff. Debsoc se hi we went on multiple trips, mostly to Delhi. Now that I think of it, I got to know about half the stuff I did on campus through you.\\nWe can literally discuss the fuck out of any topic, kitni chhoti chhoti cheezon pe puri puri raat discussions kiye hai, me trying to be logical everywhere and summing it up with a strawman in the end hehe. I remember ek baar humne Dandi kitna chaapu hai and uske future pe 1 ghanta discuss kia tha and yeh same cheez we have done for so many people. Pure campus ki gossips ek room mein pack hoti thi, the reason everyone came to our room despite the mess. Voh mattress yaad hai in the centre of our room, kitne log soye hai vahan aake, especially Babla.\\nWe started on such divergent trajectories but it never felt that way while talking to each other and once these trajectories came together fir toh time fell short for all those discussions. RM, Chowpathi, OAT, BSBE raat ko random walks pe jaana have been the moments to cherish for me.\\nFfs dude, we even planned writing a combined As We Leave.\\nHave a lot more to say over a full bhandi in Gurgaon, concluding it with what you said in Goa - \'Itne log roommates bante hai but sirf hum log last tak roommates rahe\'.\\nApologies for all the grammatical and structural flaws, another you and me thingy :P\\n","author":"Bhavjeet  Singh","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf926e659165b3aa6468b9"},{"text":"\xf0\x9f\x98\x93\xf0\x9f\x8d\xbb","author":"Bhavjeet  Singh","visibility":true,"_id":"60cf92f9659165b3aa6468bb"},{"text":"Think I said the main things during *that* night in Goa, but yeah need that Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s plan to come to fruition asap.
