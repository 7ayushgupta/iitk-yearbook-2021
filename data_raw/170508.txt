You have such an eclectic mix of awkward moments, all of which can\'t be described here, but I am going with my favourite one. \\n\\"I have decided I won\'t have labs on Mondays\\" \xe2\x80\x94 that painfully awkward moment when you realise your lab is, in fact, on Mondays.\\n\\nPeople always asked me how are you and I, such good friends, despite having supposedly opposite personalities? This question always brought a big smile to my face imagining how I would tell you about this later. \\nIt was always so simple with us. If I am hungry, you will accompany me to the canteen, simple. And, if I don\'t like someone, you will talk about throwing them out of the window for eternity but never do it, again simple xD. \\nYou are my best high companion, horse riding partner, favourite coffee date, and undoubtedly the first and last person to do Titanic pose with me :D\\n\\nEE would unmistakably kill me in your absence. So thanks for saving my life there and also from crazy campus dogs.\\nOur relationship was mostly taking turns to handle and pamper each other. Whether it was cooking up conspiracy theories, daydreaming about fancy vacations, wishful thinking about EE courses getting cancelled, motivating each other to stay awake till breakfast after a night out, or any ordinary day at IITK with you, it was all worth it.\\nWe have come a long way from that stapler to our T-spanner, lonely Vodka to shared coffees and formal hellos to teary goodbyes, and now there is no right way to end this sentence because our journey doesn\'t end here.\\n\\nSince this was going to be things left unsaid version so here it comes \xe2\x80\x94\\nYour loyalty towards friends is commendable. You indeed are a force of nature in providing your friends unconditional faith and support (also when a lizard manages to enter your room xD). \\n\\nI am fortunate I had the liberty, comfort and sheer thrill of unleashing my authentic self in front of someone during these four years. The amount of shit I have unloaded on you is enormous, but still somehow less than the time you take to style your hair (this, of course, needed a mention here :P). \\nIt was cathartic to come to your room after a long day and just rant while finishing your food. Just talking to you made me feel better.\\n\\nAlso, I can not emphasise the importance of your words to me enough. It means a lot when you give me your honest opinions and never hold back while cheering me up. \\nYou calling me Avisaaa has always stopped me in my tracks. It always pulled me out of detached-from-reality breakdowns or distracting moments. \\n\\"One step at a time\\" \xe2\x80\x94 I will always carry these words with me; they always had a calming effect on me in the worst of times. \\nIt\'s scary that just these words will always hold such power over me, but it\'s even scarier that now you won\'t always be there to say them in person to me. \\n\\nYou have my heart\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nand all my sandwiches <3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","author":"Avisha","visibility":true,"_id":"60cbd77b659165b3aa646360"},{"text":"Priyaaa!
