You\'ve been masturbating for one hour now, yet you still haven\'t came and your penis is beginning to absorb your saliva, becoming a sticky, burning hot rod. Furiously, you begin to accelerate your masturbation rapidly. By two hours, your cock is burning in pain yet there is not a single drop of cum - not even precum.\\n\\nMeanwhile, next door, a girl is masturbating too, on stream, but they can\'t reach orgasm. In desperation, the girl has resorted to using multiple dildos inside her pussy, but even that is no use. The girl then makes a makeshift sex machine from a dildo and an electric power tool - once again, this is futile. She punches her pillow in defeat.\\n\\nBy three hours, you\'ve given up trying to cum and gone downstairs to watch more anime. However, upon seeing an anime girl fall over and have a panty shot, you feel the need to cum again. Biting your arm to lead the the pain away from your penis, you rapidly masturbate. By four hours, you\'re screaming as your rough masturbation soon rips the skin cells off your dick. Your cock is now a burning red giant, but there is no cum left - any precum that was there has evaporated.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the girl screams too - not because of finally reaching orgasm, but because they\'ve gone so long without one that they\'ve resorted to anything. Rapidly pushing the small cactus in and outside of herself, the girl\'s toe curl on bed sheets as blood flows out from her vaginal entrance. body spasming in pain - but still, she does not orgasm. The world is getting even more desperate.\\n\\nSuddenly, you get a discord notification from a friend, saying they\'ve been trying to cum to Dream x George fanfiction, but they\'ve ended up making their cock a, quote, \\"burning red giant.\\" Your eyes open in shock horror - it can\'t be, can it? You rush to the television to ask your waifu how to resolve this mystery when you find that the TV has replaced the anime with an emergency government announcement - there\'s a new disease preventing orgasms... and its contagious. You feel as if you\'re about to faint, quickly looking up if there\'s a cure - there is none. You screech in anger, knowing that your waifu will never love you if you can\'t pour semen all over a shitty print out of her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the girl cries, double fisting her bleeding self as she shrieks in rage, desperate to orgasm. What on Earth can a female do in life if they cannot orgasm? The girl is realising her chatterbate viewers are going down - she needs this orgasm. Realising that there is no hope, she illogically becomes even more desperate, suddenly barging into her brother\'s room, who is lying naked on the floor, dick ripped off next to a knife; the disease has claimed its first victim. She shoves the dick in her pussy, crying as the lactic acid burns her arm as she rapidly accelerates her brother\'s dethatched cock in and out, but it\'s no use: she has the disease.\\n\\nSuddenly, both of them stop. There\'s a large siren and a warning appears on the televisions of every house in the world, \\"There is no more cum.\\" The world quickly devolves and you hear a car crash into your house. Out of nowhere, a man grabs you by the neck, desperately shoving his cock in your ass in the need of cum, raping you. Yet, it\'s no use - the man has the disease, and so do you. Luckily, there\'s a gun to the side and you manage to pry the discord moderator off, before killing him.\\n\\nGiven a few weeks, society practically doesn\'t exist - it\'s like the apocalypse. Crime rates have skyrocketed as people loot dildo shops. The hospitals are beginning to crumble as more and more women show up with more and more exotic accidents. Meanwhile men are being completely taken over by their horniness: a female reporter is stood outside, reporting where the disease was first reported, and you feel the urge. You and the cameraman both turn on her trust, stripping her down and savagely pummelling her, but it\'s not use - you can not cum. The woman shouts, enraged too, for she can not orgasm either. Children in high school are to scared to go outside and you don\'t blame them, knowing what sickening lows you may succumb too once this disease truly takes control. Other children, who had already been on discord and thus knew about sex thanks to the moderators, have began spiralling into madness too - high schools have become orgies, with devastating costs to the countries IQ, you think.\\n\\nEighty years pass and the human population plummets. Listening to Prokofiev\'s \\"Death of Tybalt\\" in your asylum room, you attempt to masturbate one more time. Unbeknownst to you, your the last human on the planet. Entire families have killed each other, each one raping the others corpse, foolishly believing from online sources that necrophilia was the cure. Men and women have killed themselves in spectacular accidents, dying in human crushes as hundreds of orgy-goers suffocate naked. Young teenagers have formed sex cults, praying to bizarre dank memes whilst furiously fucking each other in the hope that somehow, a fucking meme removes the symptoms of a disease. Like you thought, the IQ of the general population has lowered. However, you know better, you know there\'s no cure so you separated yourself from the idiots, hiding away in this asylum with a few staff who have recently died too... And you still can\'t cum. Wailing in sadness, you scratch and tear at your cock, wishing it to hell. Eventually, with enough force, you rip your sexual organ clean off and force it into your metal handcuffs.\\n\\n\\"What\'s this?\\" You think - it worked. The handcuffs are unlocked. You look outside to the asylum balcony. You can finally escape this petty world. \\"How men and women have fallen so far.\\" You think, \\"To go from civil creatures to savage beasts, killing and raping everything in their path.\\" You shake your head, thinking of the NatGeoWild documentaries you used to watch about savage apes. With a curse to the sky, the disease claims it\'s last life as the host throws itself off the balcony. Human life is gone and now, the disease has become animal born too. A few thousand years pass and there are no complex life forms at all...\\n\\nThere\'s no more cum left on Earth.","author":"Mahajan Dipak Anil","visibility":false,"_id":"60ba19d5659165b3aa644fb2"},{"text":"There\'s no way I could express our bond and our memories in few words of a memoir. But kyunki Memoir me kuch toh likhna hai toh here it goes.....\\nOniiiii chaan !!! \\n\\nLets start by thanking counselling service jiski vajah se hum dono mil paaye. There\'s no way two introverts like us, who wouldn\'t go around socialising with people, could meet each other in this vast world. But we did and it was awesome!! It\'s just been 2 years(jisme bhi 1 saal online ) but feels like I know you since a very very long time. We had such great times together. There were a lot of highs (literally ) and a lot of lows and we made our way through both of em together. We supported each other in the most crucial times and oh boy was the journey awesome!! \\n\\nWhile I\'m writing this memoir, I recall that conversation we had in Goa regarding leaving each other and bruh I just dont feel like we\'ll ever leave each other ( just to reinforce (;P) ). You were there for me everytime I needed you and I always felt good about it because you\'re also the best person who can handle me \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c. Thanks for bearing with me all this time. I have learnt a lot of things from you!! \\n\\nRegarding the future, brother you know its all going to be okay and things will work out eventually!! And I know it will because I have seen you handle things that are so difficult to handle I have full belief in you that you will eventually figure everything out and make the best out of it. I have never seen a person who cares about ppl more than you do. You\'d cross all the levels and overcome all the personal barriers to help other ppl and that\'s one of the qualities I like the most. \\n\\nSorry for the couple of times I behaved very rudely and hurt you. I don\'t have any explanation and I know you don\'t jeed one either. \\n\\nAlso its okay to commit mistakes sometimes. After seeing you handle very tough situations I had this image that this guy is a perfect person - has the purest soul and a will to help ppl so strong that he\'ll always help people. And it is true!! But you committing a mistake sometimes gives me hope - it tells me even a person as good as digu can commit mistakes - its a very human nature to commit mistakes and no one is perfect. But do know this brother you might not be the moon on the fill- moon day but you\'re the \\"chaudavin ka chaand\\" sorta - who may not be perfect but is closest among everyone else to being perfect!! \\n\\nWhat are you doing with life ? you\'re lifting spirits up of many people - many lonely people who would not approach anyone else for help although they should and they know they should. You\'ve shown me there\'s a good and soft side to everyone and no person is evil and I cant forget that ever. You\'re someone I want to be like in terms of hooman affairs and I think enough time ke saath ho bhi jaau shayad. Thanks for giving me this hope \xe2\x98\xba\xef\xb8\x8f. \\n\\nLmao a couple of months ago we were so clean in terms of bad habits and kya bakchod geera hai graph uske baad se!! I really hope we meet sooooner and get to do all that pending stuff!! If there is one thing I will forever be grateful for then that\'d be meeting you!! Meeting you has been the been the best thing that has happened in my life till now and for some reason I think it will stay at that position forever. Don\'t know if I will find anything better after I have met you. I wouldn\'t mind going to the other world(heaven/ hell although pretty sure hum dono hell me hi jayenge saath me) after this bro!!

I still remember the day I texted you and you called me back to hear me rant out. You are the person who taught me the importance of self-care, and I will forever be grateful to you for that. You had to bear a lot of shitty arguments of mine, pata nahi sorry bolun ya thank you. Better leave it to you, jo better lage wo rakh lena, jo na lage wo bhi rakh hi lena :P. Those evening walks and philosophical (and maybe moral and ethical) discussions with you and Dipuk in our last stay are the ones that I will always cherish and remember.\\n\\nIf I remember our first interaction, it was probably on the day we became CTMs. You were an introverted, calm, sweet, humble and this awesome guy when we first met. Over the span of two years, I have seen you evolve, and the best thing about you is that you kept all of your good aspects intact within you, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t change even a bit in that regard. \\n\\nSummer of 2019 kitna mast tha na yaar, we used to just sit around and gossip in the office the whole day. I wish we got more time to be in each other\xe2\x80\x99s proximity in our Coordie tenure as well. All those long meetings, interviews, sessions, might have been frustrating at that time but are now a happy nostalgia. Also, please maaf kar dena jab bhi mene tujhe kuch bol diya ho kaam ke pressure mein aake, you know that ki mene mean karke to bilkul nahi bola hoga. And agar nahi karna hai maaf to bhi koi na, next time milunga tab aur achche se gaaliya dunga xD\\n\\nI know mein Goa trip par nahi aa paaya tha, bas uski bharpaayi hogi, barabar hogi. Situation normal hote hi worcation plan karte hain. And planning ki responsibility meri :P\\n\\nKitna bhi likh dun, wo kam hi hoga tujhe and humari journey ko describe karne ke liye. Isliye aur trivial baatein naa likh kar end kar deta hun. Baaki to tujhe pata hi hai dil se kitni gaaliyan (ya maybe blessings ;) ) deta tujhe.\\n\\nAll the best to bolunga hi, ritual jo hai, so All the best for all your future endeavours. Bahur jald wapas milenge and aur bhi jyada enjoy karenge. Waise bhi tu kahan hi jaa raha hai, apna to Oracle se lekar Bangalore tak ka saath hai. A lot more years filled with fun are yet to come. Stay in touch nahi bolunga kyunki wo to tu rahega hi, and agar contact chhuta to fir to you know me, ki mein kya karunga tere saath :P\\n\\nUntil next time then.
