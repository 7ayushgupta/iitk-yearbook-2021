Aur haan desperation ki baat tu to mat hi kar bro sab ko pata hai kon kitna desperate hai 😂..Tere alag hi kisse hai summer camp se lekar interIIT tak ke....yha bata nhi sakta😅.

The time I had spent with you during 9th& 10th had brought me lot changes  as a person. Tu uss batch me padta tha jha hum soch bhi nhi sakte the  I used to wonder how would you able to manage at that time. I used to compete with you , used to learn from you, try to imitate your way and that had brought me a lot of positive changes in me. 
And it was fortunate that we landed up in same college 🙂. 
All the best mate for future endeavour. 
Stay connected!
