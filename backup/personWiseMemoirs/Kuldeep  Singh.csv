Almost 3.5 saal inferiority complex m raha, but when I met you, I found an awesome friend in you jo party dene m nahi darta. I'm proud that I met a person like you as even today I brag about you in front of people that you are such a nice personality. I hope korea m tumhe artificial ki jagah original maal milega. Ghar par R***iputram ki parampara ko aage badhaya hoga tumne. Apni dosti kam time k liye thi ye matter nahi karta, but ye pichhle 3 saal se bhi jyada bakchod thi ye matter karta hai, aur aage bhi hmesha hi rahegi, Those perfect shots in moonlight at the top of helicopter building, that illegal breach in environmental building, that IPL match, library k peeche ki wo forcefully bnayi gayi candid photo(ye shailab to kitna bada ......... hai), airstrip tak pahuchne ki nakam kosis and of course your choice of songs, how can I ever forget that and pretty much sure I will never get those moments back. I gave you some fever and cough as a parting gift as you followed me to quarantine in those last moments, no need to thank me for that. I I wanna see you in living a balanced life to jaldi se kisi ko pata le aur milwana zaroor. I'll be one of the first persons to buy your novel and go through it. I miss you brother..... Milte rhna jab bhi moka mile.... I'll always be there for you for anything for any sort of bakchodi....",Kuldeep  Singh,True,60a6107b819323d199d489dd,Durgesh Rajendra Agrawal

6,"I wish I could write a book on you over a period of few months as every second I spent with you were exhilarating for me. I saw you on your Birthday for the first time and tried to gift you that pink foam balloon and passed out while looking at you as you were always such a beauty. Just your name is enough to fill me with enthusiasm that was the reason that I was able to get up from my bed and went to 8am class  to write down your name on the board. HSS to bhana tha, mera motivation to tumse hi tha wahan aane ka. Then came Tauu project, I can recall that you made our door opener a success when all of us gave up on that, even that lab was never tiring for me becuase of you. I used to ask people(nitesh, shrey...) about you and always tried to figure out some possibilities to steal some moments with you. You were one of the inpiration for me that I came back to that campus in those last months of my final year. Starting with chai samosa in canteen till almost daily nightouts, daily nayi nayi building dhoondhna, naye naye raston par jaakar sis guard k bolne par wapas aana, OAT m KK ka concert dekhna, ya Holi k din illegel tareeke se bahar ghoomkar aana, wapas aakr hall 13 ki canteen m khakar fir se ghoomne nikal jaana, Hall 2 se NCL ki taraf waali road par alag alag ped k naam par ladai karna,then NCL m paani peene k bhane sis guard ka ch***ya kaatna, wahan se nikalkar Helicoptor building ki chhat par jaakar uss breez ko feel karna, beech m yahi kahin IME building m poster k peeche deshbhakti dikhana, aur bahar nikalkar alag alag flowers par gyaan jhadna, Environmental bulding m fountain k paani par stone ko jump karana, RM k top floor se kanpur ko taadna, aur late raat bhootiya feeling m ""Mere dholna sun"" bjana, fir auditorium waale raste par pedo m alag alga insaano ki sakal dhoondhna, aage illegal tareeke se Park 67 m entry maarna,  wapas aate hue director waali road par pandey aur shrey ko race lgane k liye majboor karna, beech m tumahra hostel zaroor aayega par ye ghoomne ka silsila abhi thode hi khatam hoga, abhi to chawpati par dahi kawab bhi to khana hai, fir daaru ki planning bhi to karni hai (I really miss ki m tum logo k saath mahi pi paaya, but this isn't the ending) all centered around you and you only, ye sab to ek din ka chhota sa hissa hai, aise kitne hi din ham log saath m bakchodi kiye hai. How can I ever forget that sweet girl who came to meet me in my deadly quarantine(though again illegal :) ) and put a smile on my face. You are an epitome of inspiration for me. I have braged about you infront of almost everone I had known. I wanna live that life again... You made my days worthy to remember in the campus...You are the sweetest, cutest, enthusiatic, fantastic, heartful, adventuress, damn beautiful, girl I have ever met. I miss you and will always...Milte rhna, abhi to trip karna hai, daru pini hai, alumni banke wapas se campus ghoomna hai... even a lifespan will be less itni masti karni hai and what not. I'm eager to see you again, again kanpur wapas ka aane ka motivation degree se jyada tum hi ho....I'll always be there for you for anything, any sort of bakchodi.... 
see you soon

7,"Bhai ab to btade campus m kon pasand hai...I can't remember a single moment jab ham ek doosre ko dekhkar na hase ho, bc itni bhi joker jaisi sakal nahi hai, par hasi to aa hi jaati, I was never even a percent of you but always tried to catch up to you, Bhai tu hai chapu maan le, Bahut RR machata hai, fir hmi ko chhorkar aage badh jaata hai, ham ussi bakchodi m fase rah jaate, Lucknow shaandar tha but usse bhi shaandaar thi wo raat, How can I forget our ""Aishwrya rai"" dancing on ""Kajra re"" and then that stud guy dancing in hall 8 on the ocassion of diwali, sab log bas group m circle bnakar tujhe hi taad rahe the. I always figured out a part of me in you, I never missed a chance to brag about you infront of people, I'm blesses to have a brother like you. Dhyaan se dekhiye iss masoom se chehre k peeche chipe stud launde ko, jispar ladkiyaan marti hai, but bhai sahab bhaav nahi dete, Bhai Badminton m jo maarta tha tu hmesha yaad rahega. Apna pushup challenege to barkarar rahega, though looking at you right now, I accept my defeat even before competing with you. I'll miss you brother.... Milna hai bhai, ye thode hi ending hai....I'll always be ready for any sort of bakchodi with you, just ping me once... ",Kuldeep  Singh,True,60a64228819323d199d48cfc,Kunal  Sharma
