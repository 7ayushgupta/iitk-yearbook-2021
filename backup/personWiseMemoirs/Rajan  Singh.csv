0,"Yaar Dhawal kahah se shuru karu tumhare bare mai. Tumhare sath jo maze or masti kare sath kari thi wo to kabhi nahi bhul sakte. 
The first impression i had of you was of a rich spoilt pampered kid to top that with your round-faced- pahadi look. Always playing GTA-V and watching TV series. Or Randomly kabhi ""OHH Godddd"", ""OHHH FKKKKKKK"", ""BC"", ""MC"" Bhai poori wing ko pata chal jata that ki Aj Dhawal movie ya tv-series dekh raha hai. Kisko pata that ki tumhare andar ka bathroom singer itna grow kar jayega age jaake. 
Sociology mai exam se jyada to tumhari harkate dekh ke dar lagta tha, Sochta tha ""kitna chill hai yaar yee""😂. Mai apne ap se kehta tha ""ruk jao end sem ane do sari coolness nikal jayegi"" 😅. 
Magar afsos aisa kuch nahi hua. Dhawal bhaiya to humare shuruwad se hi chapu the. Adi ye shayad tumse kabhi keh na saka ho but wo tum teeno ko(Tu,  Deepak, Shubham ) ko first year mai bahut gali deta tha. Roj rat ko mere room ke bahar ake ""Mc kya randap macha rakha hai in teeno ne mere bed pe""
Aur fir summer camp maine sakshat logo ko roast karte hue dekha. Maja to bahut aya par Mujhe nahi pata tha tere ane wale sare shows mujhi par honge 😅. 
And then it happened, I shifted with Hemant to another wing and jo tumhari bitching start hui kya batau. Magar had to tab ho jati thi jab tum mere hi room mai ake mere hi bed pe baith ke mujh pe hi show kar rahe hote the.  Kaise hi late night campus  walks or inhi sab bachodiyo mai samay beet gaya pata hi nahi chala. 
But the last months on the campus were the best, even the quarantine with you guys was awesome. Wo late night walks on hall 4 chat, or ninja banke shubham ka room dhundna😂. Listening your stories about your past your school life and your struggles, ""belt se bhai-sahab dwara maar"", wo 11 km daily run, wo ias -ips walo ki mast life, ""wo ouija board wali kahani"", ""wo 6 thousand se 6 crore 6 thousand wali investment scheme"" 🤑🤑🤑. Kash real life mai bhi mere pas tere jaise credit card hota 😝.  But the promises we made on the hall 9 stairs top still remain unfulfilled. 
Jao yaar bahar and karo ji bhar ke jitne tour karne hai, and PERSONS nikalo yaar. Bas ji le apni jindgi and live a live to its fullest.
Thanks for being such a wonderful part of my life. 

P.S. - bas bada admi banke bhul mat jana or wo 70% -30% paise batne wala kuch nahi tha bas tum hi log chadaye ja rahe the.

Yaar pehli baar mai tumhe apne dada wale interaction mai dekha tha. Jab mai Subway surfers khel raha tha and Ramrao niche swimming kar raha tha 😅. Aur tum chup chap ek kone mai aram se baith kar so rahe the. Tabhi mujhe lag gaya tha ki ye ladka bahut age jayega😂. 
From being that shy introvert pahadi sa ladka, ""3-bot की लाश"", yaar sare courses mai bas A lagte lagte reh gaya to becoming the fun-loving and vibrant person you are today.
But I would never have got to know you better, had it not been those nights when we played UNO or cards, your poker faces, and believing you in Bluff thinking ""आभिशेक कभी झुठ नही बोलता"", the last night out with Shrey and you, wo LOC101 wale course ki bate, tumhare wo adventures wali doosre desh ke kisse-kahaniyaa and how can I forget tumhara wo HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM........😅
I would cherish all these moments forever. 
Thank you for being such a sweet and understanding person, for giving me such wonderful memories.
Jarur yaar touch mai rahenge aur intezaar rahega tumhari album ka.

2,"Aur bhai Phooking Mistry...... band ho gaya tera rona dhona. kitna rota tha yaar tu, poore last ke 2 mahine tune kuch nahi kiya and last mai phod ke ghar nikal liya.
Mujhe aj bhi yaad hai first year ke orientation tujhe fever tha and maine tere documents carry kare the and tu mujhpe hi gussa karne laga tha. Us time mujhe laga itne selfish and MC kaise ho sakte hai log. But wo kehte hai na dont judge a book by and aj char sal bad mujhe lagata hi you are perhaps the most kindhearted and sweet person I've ever met. 
In my entire 4 years, I couldn't think of a single day when we weren't together 😅. Right from 3 bot to Athletics CPA to Group - B of 1st year. Machana to tumne ate hi start kar diya tha, 1st sem mai hi district mai gold and was offered to go to INTER IIT but bhai had other plans. 
From pulling an allnighter before the PHY 103A exam, or, keeping up with Ram Narain RIP workout 😭, or, late night campus walks, or, hearing about your plans to make money 🤑, or asking you for money in library and buying stocks with it, and dhawal making a story about - ""Aditya ne ek bar Rajan ko paise diye - bas yahi take this story uske bad Aditya ko kabhi wo paise wapis nahi mile""😂. 
But the best part was perhaps the summer camp with athletics team, waking up early in morning and cribbing about the workout, going to ganga barrage, Playing cards and hearing about the stories of seniors, Making stories about others, and going swimming,  and then the blue world trip Yaad hai jab hum hamari kitni fat rahi this uchi rides pe and jab hum us ride pai top see gir gaye the..... 
Magar fir tum bade ho gaye or humse jyada samay apne any freindsssss ke sath samay bitane lage the. Aur fir tumhari jindgi mai kusum ayi....
Hume to laga that Aditya humare liye campus aya hai but nahi..... Aditya ko to ghadi chaiye thi. 
But campus ke wo last months mai kitna maza kiya that yaar, wo photoshoot outs, wo tumhare walk pe na jane wale bahane, hall 4 and 9 ki chat pe gyan wali bate, and holi pe tumhara jalwari wala dance, long distance road running in the lockdown and, your future plans at the age of 25 🤣🤣🤣. 
Bahut yaad ayega yaar.  But touch mai rehna kabhi bhi man kare to call ya text kar dena.

3,"Jassi tere sath rehkar aur kuch sikha ho ya na but ye to pakka sikh hi gaye ki whenever on camera 
SAY JASSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 😂😂😂😂

Waise to mujhe bhi yaad nahi ki apni sabse pehle baat kab hui thi  😅  😅. but ab mujhe lagta hai tujhse aur pehle baat kyo nahi kari thi.
Yaar Maine pehle baar tere bare mai tab suna tha jab humare midsem ke results aa gaye the and mess me Dhawal wagera keh rahe the - wo dekh Jassi ne wo Jassi hai, usne MTH101 ka paper phoda hai. To chapu to apna jassi pehle se hi tha. 

2nd year ke udhgosh se leke ane wale sare tournaments mai humesha dekhta tha ye kon banda hai yaar humesha volleyball ke match me itne enthu ke sath cheering karne aajata hai.
Par tujhse achhe se bat karna to 4th sem se hi start kara tha when you became the gensec and I was the captain. Those council meetings, strategy planning, talks with the coaches, and roaming around the campus, the calculation for GC standings, made our bond of friendship much stronger.

So much so that I loved our after-practice talks in Hall - 3 Mess, with Bhaskar and Sachin and others, where you would take my extras like no care grin like 😁.  Then Mess wale bhaiya would ask us ""bhaiya bahut time ho gaya hai"" and we would rush to your room to submit one or another assignment.  Waha pe bechara Vikky baith ke assignment kar raha hota tha😅😅

I felt like I was your roommate for 3rd year. Your motivational seminar - ""koi nahi yaar, hum karenge hum mehnat karenge aur MTH ke endsem phodenge😂😂"". I cant think of anything jiski humne tere room mai baithke stragety na banayi ho 

marks kaise lane hai?
yaar kaise niklega ye course😥?
teams ki performance kyo nahi aa rahi hai?
Yaar body kaise banayu😅?
and ye wala to epic tha - Inter IIT 2019 mai roorkee mai kaha ghoomne jayegne😂😂""?
ye sab to kuch na ho saka but kam se kam passout hone  see pehle campus aa gaye wahi bahut hai.
Wo akkri din jab jor barish ho rahi thi and sab ro rahe the ab lagta hai life ka kitna bada hissa yahi campus mai hi chod ja rahe hai.
Ek bar to placement ke time ye laga ki itne ache log bhi hote hai kya( if you know what I mean 😅). But sahi mai yaar bahut accha nature hai tera and kitne acche tarike se bat karta hai tu. Looks like i am writing confession😅. But its true. 
Kharagpur mai jitne maje tere aur Tiwari ke sath aye the cheering mai cahe wo Lawn tennis ki ho 😉 ya Basketball ki. Koi game nahi choda tha yaar jisme gala nahi baith gaya ho chill chilla ke. I will always cherish these memories with you and the entire contingent.
Bas yaar touch mai rehna and bada admi bankar bhul mat jaiyo. ",Rajan  Singh,True,60a670d8819323d199d48ffc,Jaspreet  Singh
4,"Yaar pata nahi tha ki first year ka wo bhola bhala masum sa bachha akhir mai chalke itna machayega. First year mai laga nahi tha itne maje karenge sath mai. Aur tumhare upar jo kahaniya sunathe the dusre log, khaskar divyanshu wo to dope thi😂. Aur, monopoly mai tum itni gandi gandi deals dete the uspe to kya hi kaha jaye. But all in all, I am glad we met and became such good friends.
Ab itna bada admi bad gaya hai to bhul to jayoge hi, 😅 but fir bhi keep in touch.
Aur last mai jo tum shrink ho gaye the uska bhi secret batana.",Rajan  Singh,True,609a15ba819323d199d47978,Ravi  Kumar
5,"Arrey arey ye kya likha hai - gamer boy? What about Mai bhagna chahta hu, udna cahta hu, girna cahta hu, but rukna nahi cahta hu 😂 😂
Yaar life se mujhe bas yahi shikayat hai ki tumse pehle kabhi baat kyo nahi ki?
First-year mai jab tum adi ke room pe randaap macha ke use bahar kar dete the, tab wo mujhe batata tha ki kaise roommates hai uske😆. Aur mujhe lagta tha ki tum bas 24x7 bas gaming karte ho nothing else. But ab mujhe lagta hai ki kitna galat tha mai. I never thought ki hummari likes, dislikes, sab itne acche se match karte hai. 
Chahe late night campus walk ho ya after lunch stairs pe discussion ya fir hall 9 chat par gyan wali bate it was always a delight interacting with you. Tumhare, Dhawal aur Aditya ke wo height hight wale jokes😡. Ya basketball ground mai tum logo ke school ki dukh bhari dastaan, 😅. Bahut yaad ayengi.
But kuch bhi kaho sabse jyada maja to tumhare room mai sabke sath tumhare bad pe baithke or tumhare laptop pe gane sunke discussion karne mai ata tha. The holi party was Dope!!! and tumhara jalpara🤭🤭.
Tumhara wo mujhe skating sikhane ka tarika jisme mai gir raha hota tha and tum mast se Dhawal se bat kar rahe hote the. and out of the blue anime discussion at litrellly at any time of night. Wo photoshoot ke time ke cheap thrills and your piro wale photoshop skills bahut yaad ayega. 
Thanks for being such a wonderful person that you are.
Bas touch mai rehna bhai. ",Rajan  Singh,True,60a658ac819323d199d48e99,Shubham

7,"Yaar tumhare bare mai to koi acchi baat yaad hi nahi aa rahi hai ( not my fault). let me see where do we start, Chapu, superb player, Ladykiller, apna Ritik Roshan, WORST ROOMMATE 😝, Wo tumhare sath late night campus walks, out of blue philosophical talks, and playing cards and monopoly and what not. And your constant cribbing about how ""app will not allow it"".
But you were the one person whom I could reach any time and discuss anything. I will cherish each and every moment shared with you forever. 
stay like that and keep in touch.",Rajan  Singh,True,609a1ad8819323d199d4797c,Reithick  A
