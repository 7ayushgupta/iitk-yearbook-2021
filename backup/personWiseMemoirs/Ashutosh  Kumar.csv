Wo almost har course ke baare me rona dhona se leke profs ki bitching tak sab kar rakha hai hmlogo ne.... 😅

Apart from acads bhi we resonated in more ways than one. CCD and Doaa ki coffee ke bahane bhi bhot hangout kara hai hmlogo ne saath me. Looking back I wish we watched a lot more movies together ek hi dekha hai aaj tak saath me, should have done that more 🤔🤔. You were always easy to talk to and  u were one of the very few who actually used to listen to the problems instead of just shoving it off, u were also one of the very few i could talk to about almost anything.  Ab as a person tmhare baare me kya hi bol sakte hai chaapu to tm ho hi bas chaapte rhna and remain the kind hearted soul that u are. 🙃🙃
No goodbyes i really hope to c u sooooon till then all the best

1,"Are (chutiya) Bihari...... 
First impression yaad hai mereko abhi bhi tmhara (Mera naam ABI-SEK hai)  😂😂. Bol bolke aadat sudhaar diye honge hmlog sab 4 saal me 😬 . Probably tm department ke sabse phle dost hoge tm
aur upar se tm bihari nikal gaye sone pe suhaga 🤣🤣🤣 ( hm bolke baat karne wala akela insaan mere alawa ) . Itna zada pareshaan karne wala insaan hai na tu matlab kya hi batae.😑😑. Bhot saari memories hai be tere saath matlab ameya ko saath me maarne se leke raat ko neend me roll khane jaana, ya koi bhi nayi movie aaye to bas z-square pohoch jaate the hm dono baaki koi aaye na aaye (mostly mai kheechke le jaata tha😅). Pure college me probably sabse zada berhmi se maara hai maine tereko tmhare bday pe 😤👀😬( PS - i don't regret it tmne bhi bhot maara tha bhot hi zada ).Ek do random memories ye bhi hai ki tune mereko mere 1st year room ke khidki se kudaya tha 🙄
gate lock karke chale gaye the mera( maine tmhare NCC wale day badla le liya tha 😝😝😝),  plus wo eso 208 ki class ko pubg me convert kar dena 🤣🤣. Rha baat course wagera ka to usme to mostly ek jaisa haal hi rhta tha sab anshuman bharose 🤡. Bhai ye covid ka mid sem end sem ko kabhi nhi bhulenge hm lectures bina dekhe itne zada number aaye the jitne padhke bhi nhi aaya aaj tak college me . Plus tmne jo courses me aur projects me fraud maara hai na wo mere se better to koi nhi jaanta, kisiko bata diya to abhi bhi watt lag jaegi teri. Yaar ab pure 4 years ka to nhi likh paenge bhot zada memories hai, But jaisa chutiya jaisa trust karta hai na tu merepe bhot kam log karte the waisa same trust college me log mere upar 🙃🙃, ig uske liye thanks (ab zada udd mat bhot pit jaega 😈). Aur aise bhi company jaane ke baad agar galti se bhi bhul gaya mereko ya ignore mara to tab to tm bhi jaante ho aur mai bhi jaanta hu ki kya hoga tere saath plus ab tm itne mote ho gaye ho ki bhaag bhi nhi paoge merese😂😂. All the best goodluck ya bye nhi bolne wale hm tereko bhad me jaa wo inn logo ke liye hai jinse baat nhi hone wali aur terese itni formality bhai kaun hi karega. Chal baaki wahtaapp kar dena kuch baat hua to call to mai nhi uthaunga ek baari me 😬.... ",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a4de90819323d199d48249,Abhishek  Kumar
2,"apne wing ka bahubali... (thoda zada izzat wala nickname pad gaya hai tera 😶) .Pata wo first year me agar saath me pura aero summer project fraud nhi maara hota na to maybe aaj itne ache dost nhi hote😅. pure 1st year tmse kam hi jaan phchaan hui thi lekin summers ke baad bhot ache se jaan liye bhot bade nalayak ho🤣🤣🤣. Plus admist covid goa 🤩 happened to bas ab aur kya chahiye🙃. A word of advice unknown logo ke saath galti  se bhi drink mat kar lena bilkul control me nhi rhte
🙄🙄. Tune aur hitesh ne hi shuru kara tha ye behna behna wala harkat 😝😑 chal maaf kiya. Althogh tm emotional fool ho but at the end of the day bhot acha insaan hai yaar tu. Hopefully ye pandemic ke baad phirse sab saath me chal sake kahin🤞🏻.... All the best for your future endevours (ye line formality thi 😛😛 maybe common bhi mil jaye doosre kisi me🤫) Nonetheless hope to cu soon.....🙃",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a4e2ae819323d199d48269,Amrendra Pratap Singh
3,"Broo !! 🙃  thoda late ho gaya likhne me tmhara  memoir 😅 . I couldn't agree any more we resonate with each other so much when it comes to hobbies  🤩. In my entire stay at iitk i didn't meet any other person  jo koi diary maintain karta ho ya karta tha past me (it was just the two of us ) .Plus u  came across as a very nice and chill guy to hang out with and apne text messages koi padhle to bechare ko kuch samjh na aaye aise switch hote the hmare topics. And how can i forget u have gotten damn good when it comes to animation 😍😍. I am really glad that our paths crossed.,here's to hoping to c u in good health soon all the best till then...... cheers 🥂",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a5a337819323d199d4874b,Archit  Gupta
4,Namaste shukla ji !! Apni baat ache se hona to TA 201 me shuru hui thi . Bhai kya fraud maara hai uss ek canon ko banane me hmlogo ne XD.

5,"Man!! writing your memoir was one of the 2 toughest ones (u can guess the othe one 😅 ). I am pretty sure neither one of us know how tf or when we met and how we ended up becoming such good friends 🙃 (friends would be an understatement idc 👀 ). We actually don't have anything in common lol 🤣🤣 (now that's something). It was only later that we found out about the mutual love about movies and food (chick blast, dominos, chocolate room pretty sure we have tried 
every item on all of those menus plus zomato 🤤🤩 ). We even tried playing tennis which ended up with knee pain a lot of it 🙄 and how can i forget that dedication towards basketball 🏀 i mean i got better because of it. Plus damn dude u are so bad with emotions i mean i am bad u are way 
worse than me. Plus u gotta come up with better justification for your caffeine addiction ☕. That being said u are also one the most energectic people i have come across in college. And thanks for 
being such a positive influence on me and motivating everyone around you 🙃🙃.  Don't change the kind hearted soul that u are (maybe u can learn how to talk to people of ur brother's age 😂 ) . We should go on trip soon 🤞🏻
I tried to keep it short since u specifically mentioned not to write your memoir 😶. All the best dude and m pretty sure u are gonna make all of those unreal ambitions come true and miss u broooo ❤️❤️.  
Wanted to end it  by saying Something Cool 😎

6,"Hey bro!! 🙃 m pretty sure we met at the club first and then got to know we share the same CPA. U are one of the most easy going and chaapu person at the same time,  i am really glad that we got to meet each other. 🤩 Hope are paths cross again soon till then all the best for your future endeavours.... cheers🥂",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a538e9819323d199d48412,Mataria Pence Jagatkumar
7,"Namiii !! 😬 i am so glad hm dono me wo useless ime ka course saath me liya tha XD warna kabhi baat hi nhi ho paati apni 😅.  I got to know u quite late but at least jaan to paaye thoda  . And man those tekken nights  and rocket league afternoons plus u completely obliterating me in injustice 😑😑. We had basketball and tt too as contributors to our friendship. Plus wo saath me maze lena gota vineet aur dewansh ke 😂😂 . I am glad that our paths crossed , here's to hoping to c u soon in good health...  cheers 🥂 ",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a5a9c0819323d199d4875f,Naman  Roshan
8,"Hey bro 🙃. Yaar hmlog bhot ghumte the saath first year me from going to all the club workshops together to taking a leisurely stroll in the evening , plus how can i forget phy me kitna help karte the tm mereko 😅 . After departments happened apun ka hangout karna kam ho gaya but things never got weird with u hmlog jab bhi milte the maze me baate karte the and enjoy karte the . Hope to c u real soon and all the best till then 🤞🏻✌🏻😊",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a5a17c819323d199d48746,Paramveer Dharmavir Raol
9,"Pandaaaaa ( the name suits you in more ways than one 😬 ) ... at leat kahin to tennis wali dp nhi hai 🤣🤣. I actually don't remember phli baar kab baat hui thi hmlog ki but m glad ho gayi thi 🙃 cuz I am pretty sure during the first year before we got into our departments tm academically sabse badi help the mere 😅, Especially that disaster of Phy (102 n 103 🙄) wo dono subjects paar hue the almost solely cuz of tmne jo padhaya tha 👀(which mostly included ye saare examples rat lo 😶). Raat ko 2-3 baje zor zor se thok rhe hote the tmhara gate and anjesh pura irritate ho jaata tha. Even after jab depts me chale gaye then we started haning out a lot more (mostly cuz of pubg and cards but that still counts) 😬. Emotionally i never got to know u but then again maybe that's for the best idk 🤷🏻‍♂️. Plus jitna zada introverted rhte ho tm start me utna hi zada baat karte ho once u get to know someone (kinda like me) and get comfortable around them. You are sort of a really fun person to be around. I think bihari ke baad sabse zada tmhare saath hi theatre me movies dekhi hai maine (5 large coke wala disaster 😵). You are also one of the people jo honestly apna opinions de deta hai as to what i should do and what i shouldn't (really appreciate that 🙃🙃🙃).Anyway saare specific memories likhne gaye  to bhot lambi story ban jaegi and most probably knowing you tm padhoge bhi nhi 👀... All the best for your future endevours (ye to likhna hi padta)...... Really hope to c us soon n let's go travel someplace when all of this is over 😊",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a4ea10819323d199d48285,Rohan Gupta (P Kumar)
10,"Yo multi-sem dassa boi!!! 🙃🙃 aur prashant kaisa hai XD. Yaar tmhari consistency and determination ke liye to salute hai bhai tereko 🤩 matlab wing me koi kuch bhi kare tm consistently padhte the aur phodte the alag hi level pe. Apni bonding shayad mostly wo 1st year galaxy ke baad hui thi  🎨 kaafi karname kiye the udhar. All the best bro aage ke liye aur chapte rhna ( although bolne ki zarurat nhi  😅 ). Hope to c u soon aur room ke bagal me kabhi kabhi eccetric loud music ke liye sorry.....😬😬

11,"Heey Bro!! 🙃 It's true we got to know each other a little late but am glad that we did 😬. Zada hangout to nhi kara tmhare saath outside court but playing basketball tekken n pictionary with u and everyone else and has been quite entertaining 😂😂. Let's be honest last ke kuch days me meri wing almost change hi ho gayi thi u were part of the reason too ✌🏻 . Man i would never forget that conjuring wala incident ,the horror on your face 😂😂😂 , hope to give u another scare sometime soon. All the best bro and c u soon .... cheers 🥂",Ashutosh  Kumar,True,60a5a6b4819323d199d48758,Vineet  Shukla
