I met you for the first time via the Electronics Club and then we prepared for the Engineers Conclave in winter '18. I still remember us struggling to find the display room for the project in IITB :P. You were always so helpful and I remember thinking to myself as to how much you know. Then, we did the TA202A project. I remember us bitching about the team members we ended up with but still getting through the course somehow. ESO203 lab was a nightmare, figuring out which wire went where and invariably us finishing our lab work last before getting to know that the rest of the groups used to cheat :P. The last semester in AML you really helped me bro, I didnt know anything and you literally covered for me so much. I hope I wasn't too much of a burden. I would always cherish your friendship Bro. Always be like this, never change. Hope we stay in contact. 
Wish you a great life ahead.",Anirudh  Garg,True,60a97061819323d199d49425,Nitish Vikas Deshpande
