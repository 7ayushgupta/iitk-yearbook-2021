""Chal OAT chalte h"", ""Chal galaxy krte h"", ""Chal observatory chalte h"" ""Chalte h lucknow"" . Storytelling me to expert ho hi tum , lagta h ki hum hi gye the trekking, IISC, patna se hi humne schooling ki, bike se gye the pahado pe. Kabhi japani to kbhi bihari. Tension mat liya kr kaam ka vo ho jata h. Milte h next year yr.",Ashish Kumar Singh,True,60a5fd3d819323d199d488a9,Ravi  Kumar
3,"We were not even friends in 11 or 12F. But somehow you ended up in the same college, same department and same wing and then the same MM group as me. And then became a neighbour, class buddy, play buddy and what not. Helping tirelessly for exams and assignments. that dialogue - ""coming for eating"" still resonate while I eat at home. Anyway, we still have one more year to go. So more memories next year.
