Sad that we couldn't get one last photo together. I hope we meet again someday. All the best for your future 🤗",Priyakhee  Kachari,True,60a63762819323d199d48c30,Avani  Shrivastava

Oh, my shelter at IITK, I love you and going to miss you a lot. From being just neighbours to becoming closest friends, we have come a long way, and there is a lifetime to go. I can't imagine without you how my life at IITK would have been. You even helped me to cross the busy roads of Kanpur 🤪. Broh, I hope my dream of sitting at the back while riding a bicycle with you comes true someday. And also the promise over Harry potter cake, you remember that right, we are still waiting 🧐. Listen, you are responsible for getting me into K-pop, so you better take responsibility until the end. You know what I mean, right! And yes, let's achieve our dream together 😉. You know, having the same sizes as yours, were always beneficial, and I hope that remains the same so that I can steal from your wardrobe whenever we meet😁.  
 Okay, let's not write anymore. I know we are going to meet soon. HeHe

5,"Hey bhavita
You are the most hard-working and responsible girl I have known. You have always been good to me and forgiving my words (that seemed to be harsh), knowing that that's not what I meant. I'm going to miss you, and the times we spent together, especially our sudden cravings for chicken( and ending up eating out 😄) and gossips. I hope we meet again soon. Take care and love yourself more every day. I love you, my friend💛. I and my best wishes will always be with you.
P.S.: don't be scared of my expressions; they do not hurt good friends 😉. And my nickname is not cute at all + I'm gaining weight now😐.

7,"Hey Bhandar 
I am so glad that we were roommates (even if for a short period). It was amazing. You are such a sweet girl. I'm not gonna forget how you used to bring soya sticks and soya chips for me on the way back to campus😌. I will never forget the times we spent together. I am going to miss you, my friend. I hope we meet again someday. Take care 💛

8,"Hello my sister 😉
I should thank IITK culture for giving me such a nice and beautiful sister🙃. Right from day one of IITK, you have always been there for me through my ups and downs, and I'm grateful for that. The numerous memories we share, those little talks and how we used to understand what's on our minds just by looking at each other and adding to that how we had the same thought were incredible. And I'm going to miss that all.  You made my IITK life a comfortable one. I mean, not only you, even uncle and auntie helped me a lot. I couldn't have asked for a better roomie than you. Let's meet soon and until then miss me😇. Love you a lot.

9,"I don't know how to/where to start, but I have a lot to write. That's probably because we don't remember our first meeting. But I'm glad that we decided to get along 😁. You are very precious to me. You often say that very few people know 'that' side of you, and I'm happy to be one of the very few. Broh, remember your wish for a 26-year-old you, right!  Let's do that together 👉👈. I was not going to but, thank you for being always there for me during these four years and the future, because I know you will be there for your friend😁. I'm gonna miss you and the tons of memories we share. I believe we will meet again but until then, keep up with your self-love and sassiness(in a good way). My best wishes and I will always be there for you😇.  
On a side note, I'm not going to judge by quantity 😁  Before you cringe more, I will stop😅
 Love you, bro 💜",Priyakhee  Kachari,True,60a4fbbf819323d199d482d4,Yashika
