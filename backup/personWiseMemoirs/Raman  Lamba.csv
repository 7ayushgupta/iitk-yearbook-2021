0,"Hi Jatin (Rajasthani tune me h😂),
Thanks for always supporting me in volleyball. Many times I thought of quitting but you were the reason I kept going. All thanks to you I became the Captain. I always thought you will become the captain but Libero captain nai ban sakte.. So sad🥺. But you were no less than a captain for me. 
Remember all those backchodies we did in volleyball. All those games you gave me confidence (chal lambi main deta hu supply). Bhai ek regret h ki apne inter-iit medal nai la paye. Is bar to paka aa jata medal. 
Thanks for always being there. I was very depressed in the placements days but you helped me. You helped me to get that job. M just a call away. 
Love you bro😍... ",Raman  Lamba,True,60a60b0b819323d199d4898a,Jatin  Rathaur
1,"Hi Mukku,
The Bihar boy. The most energetic guy in our group. Bhai hum ko samajh me nai ata ki itni enery late khase ho.. Be it playing volleyball, badminton, football or even our gully cricket. I have spent almost all our semester breaks with you and Saini. Remember how we three used to have fun together (tum humare Babla the Bhagam Bhag ke😂). Bhai thoda kam josh ke khela karo koi bhi khel, hamesa injured hojate ho. Kitni baar tum ko HC leke gaye h hum or Saini 😂. You even spoiled your last 1.5 months of campus because of this pagalpan. Bhai hum ko ye batao kisi ka ankel twist 5 din baadme fracture kese ho sakta h😂😂. 
In these last 1.5 months your room was our cards playing adda (aur kuch to tum kar nai sakte the😂). But we enjoyed every bit of it. How we taught our famous game of President scum to everyone and remember you were our ultimate scum and I was the ultimate President (mere pass Sameer that Senapati 😂). You even changed the game to 26 but your bad luck followed you there too😂. 
I know we had many fights as our views never matched. Bro main to ase hi ladunga future me bhi 😜. Tum Gurugram me aao, full masti and full fights chalengi waha bhi. But apart from all these, you are a very kind-hearted person. I really thank you for being a part of my life.
Apna suphur abhi khatam nai hua h. Gurugram me sath me random ladkiyo ko message karenge 😜. 

All the best for your future. I will always be there for you and I’m just a call away.

Love you bro...❤️",Raman  Lamba,True,60a652c2819323d199d48e3a,Mukesh  Kumar
2,"[17:39, 18/05/2021] Raman Lamba: Looking back and thinking about how we became best friends from being wingmates. Remember the way you used to get mad at me about ESC lab (yrr tum sab log teep ke bana deta h;). You know I was always confident about our course work and used to assume that I am getting a 10 pointer in the sem from the start (dussa to abhi bhi aa rha h). 
Remember the 1st year’s summer break. You occupied my room and started to do your thing, you know how you keep your room very dirty. I didn’t like it at all (you know how clean I keep my room, and in the future too I will get mad if you do anything to my room). But I think that was the point we became best friends. You inspired me a lot. This summer help me to know you better. Your time management skills, your focus on the study work, how you feel guilt for not doing anything productive in a day, etc. There are lots and lots of quality you have that cannot be described in words.
I end up getting the difficult courses always, but the inspiration you gave me helped me always from 2nd year to still continuing;). The way we pulled together Fluids, Development Economics, and now IME 634. You have been a constant support right through. You guys are the major reason for my decent grades and my placement. I always wanted to know how you make such a kind of connection with people. Your efforts for friendships and bonds. I really would like to learn these from you.
Playing volleyball, badminton, mini militia with you was always full. But you should know I play better badminton than you as I am the king😎) (I won the championship… hahaha). But you always put full efforts into taking our photos. We are really blessed to have a skilled photographer in our group (be ready to click on my wedding😂). 
Literally, the 2 guys who always discuss “yrr ladki chahiye Zindagi me…”. Starting from the Antaragni night and never stopping again. How could a guy think about girls and relationships all day long but I think you can… Don’t worry I will always be there as your partner in doing this. I request you to reserve your grave near me so that we can secretly discuss which ghost to date.
Thanks for being always there. M also a call away! 
Love you, bro…..😘
P.S.- Spend less time in hagga!!😜",Raman  Lamba,True,60a3aeda819323d199d47f39,Piyush
3,"Hi Najan,
Chalo I accept that tune mujhe bahut khilaya h. Future me bhi khilana padega. I am not letting you go that easy from my life. Jab bhi milega treat to tu hi dega. I really enjoyed the first sem with you and Shashi. You guys saved me from those boring Uncle and Jayant. All thanks to Vipin I was able to shift to your room. Remember the treasure hut night, oh bhai.. how we roomed all night and got nothing. Remember how you ruined all my confidence after MTH101 end sem🥺. I liked your criticism of my work as all those things help me to improve in life. 
You forced me to watch animes. I really thank you for that. In the starting, I thought that a guy like you (JEE topper) would never talk to me but I was wrong. You were one of the most honest and straight forward guy I met. Bhai to itna chill kese h life me🤔. During internships, you were like ho jaye ga tension nai leneka. Chill h… And you did it as you always do. But I never doubted your intellectual skills. I am really very proud to have a friend like you in my life. 

Don’t forget your brother ever and remember I’m just a call away.

Love you bro😍..

What should I write for a person who was a part of everything which I did in the last 4 years. I know that by the time the orientation ended we were like brothers. I shifted to your room so that I can do backchoddi with you and Najan. You forced me to do many things like the Udghosh marathon, blood donation camp, and many more things by saying chal na yrr;)… We have done many courses together. You remember the night we prepared for MTH101, we finished the course in 3 hours without even looking at the logic for the questions. I had a bad habit of taking bad courses in your department, like MOS and Numerical. But we pulled through them together. Remember how we help Meena to clear MOS. you almost got me caught by the prof in the end sem exam all thanks to your loud speakers🤫;) 
Bhai.. I don’t get how can someone laugh like you. Laughing at most awkward places. (Bhai tere sath kahi bhi jane me daar lagta h… pata chala to haas ne lag gya). But I like the way you laugh and ignore others if they are making fun of you. You never get mad, just smile at them. Keep laughing always and make me feel awkward always. 
I know I got mad at you many times. Aur tune bahut manaya bhi h muhje. I am not letting you go easy, aage bhi ese hi manana padega. always… be it college, Gurugram, or even in the future. 
You were there in my most difficult times be it during internships, then lockdown, and then placements( har test ke baad randi rona krte the...xD). Because of you, I managed to get the offer from OYO. Raat ke 3 baje bhi tu mujhe guide kar rha tha placements me. I remember the happiness you and your whole family felt after hearing my job selection. I agree with you that this lockdown helped us to get rid of our lodu (yudh) habit. Otherwise internship ke time jese placement me bhi yudh karte rhte;) 🥲
The last 1.5 months of college were really awesome. But you always spoiled our movie screening plan. Don’t forget the day when you laughed at my singing😤. 

Good bye to apna hoga nhi, abhi tujhe meri shaadi bhi karwani h. Chal milte haan jaldi hi. 

Thanks for being always there. M also a call away! 
Aajao... *Awkward hugs*...Chalo Badhia!
Love you, bro…😍😍

5,"Hi Vipin,
The quiet little boy in 1st year to a nice, soft-spoken, sincere, and wise counsel, ever ready with witty replies! The struggling boy of 1st year to a very brave man now. You really made it. You made me believe that a person can do anything if he desires. I used to feel like I am all alone in our department as there was no one in our wing from our department and I don’t have many friends from our department too. But you were there always with me. 
You took all those crazy courses with me. We pulled through all those tough courses together. I think you were the reason why my grades started to improve from 2nd year. Looking at you I used to feel how could a person be this much determined to know about concepts. You always dig deep into the problem. The hard work and energy that you would put into everything were exceptional, you would just keep studying until you understand the concept. Never settle for less. Never tried to remember things, always wanted to know how things happened. 
I think because of me you developed the habit of watching all those tv shows. I used to watch movies, tv shows, and animes always. Sorry for giving you a bad habit of watching shows in middle of exams too😝. But I am grateful to you as you taught me many good things. 
The friend who emerged as one of the important person in my life. I am not going to say goodbye as I am not letting you go for my life ever. Keep calling me and we will discuss all the ransom shit of life.🙂

Thanks for always being there. Love you bro😍… Always be calm and self-confident.",Raman  Lamba,True,60a602dd819323d199d48904,Vipin
