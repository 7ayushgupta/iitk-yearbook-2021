I will always remember you as the ""work hard and party hard"" guy. The way you stood up in F2 was legendary. First year me humesha doubts batane ko taiyar rehte the bro. And tumhari branch change ke baad Batti courses me kami lagi tumhari. 
I can never forget your birthday celebration at OAT and then dancing in the wing until seniors came to shut our party down. You have always been an interesting guy to talk to. 
Also thanks for the ""Paris Darshan"". Video call pe Eifel tower dikhaya :p Aaj bhi video call ka SS saved hai.
You have been the kind of guy who was always enthusiastic to hang out with the wing, and have always been the front runner in all the fun episodes. Be it EDMs or Holi Party you have always been there with the wing. 
Never knew that car ride to home/station with you would be the last time we'd be meeting as college students.
Stay the same bro. Hope to meet you real soon!",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a570ec819323d199d48669,Ananta  Mukherjee

2,"Yo Ashu Bhai!!
The oldest (or second oldest) member of C6. Wing me sabse mature aur chill banda hai bhai tu. C6 me koi bulla bole toh Ashu ka room yaad aata hai. Tere room pe kitne maze kiye hain bhai. Tere ko pehli daaru pilayi hai bhai meine :p
Teri GPL lene me humesha maze aaye hain. Tere sath political debates me kya hi maze aate the. Let's hope jald hi fir milen aur saath me daaru party karen. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a5764d819323d199d4868a,Ashutosh  Sharma

You have wonderful art skills. I still remember during first-year you used to record charcoal drawing and other paintings. Keep in touch bro!   ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a5566e819323d199d4857a,Ayush  Bhorse
4,"Girish Sharma, apne wing ki sabse buland awaz. Wing me sasbko jab tu bulata tha bhai kya mast entry hoti thi teri ek dum chillate hue. Tu ek aisa banda hai jo wing ke bahar bhi full involve hua aur wing me bhi sabke saath rha. Jald hi ab tu naam roshan karega wing ka UPSC me. Tere baare me sabse acchi baat: Dosto ke liye humesha taiyyar rehta tha tu. Aage bhi aise hi rahio. Aur bhul mat jaio kabhi humko. ✌",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a41850819323d199d48083,Girish  Sharma

You are one of the most sincere and hardworking guy I have ever met. Thanks for being there in CHM201. Stay the same bro! ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a554d5819323d199d48560,Harshit  Kumar
6,"Yo Nimish!
You may look big and tough from the outside, but I know you are very sensitive and caring for your friends. Your dance tutorial during Odessey was legendary. You are one of the few guys who were never afraid of trying new things and I am pretty sure that will take you places!
Be it wing parties or cricket matches your enthusiasm was what kept the wing going. Let's hope we get to party together soon. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a55b8d819323d199d485b1,Nimish  Agarwal
7,"Yo Raju aka NotAnEzTargt xD!
One of the most entertaining guy of our wing. First year me B6 me ""ragging"" lena aur Anuj/Bibhu ke sath epic fights were all too much fun. Also you were senior's favourite in our wing :p
Second year me tune party badal li thi 😪 From PUBG to Valo pro player kaafi badla gaya tu.
You were my go-to guy for this pandemic placement session. Resume se lekar tests tak sab tere saath discuss kiya. Stay the same boi. Let's hope job ke time bhi touch me rahenge asie hi.",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a4029a819323d199d48031,Raj  Kumar

9,"Ladies and cheems, introducing you the youngest member of C6, the one who never wears half-shirt, A* in ESC and LIF, Fakka in MTH, Vietnam intern, sole admin of our wing group, most loved senior of some, greatest memer, controversy brewer, unofficial Festi of fests, Institute PUBG League Chairman, moderator of IIM the great Shobhit Sachan. *Drum Rolls*

Bhai mein tera example deta hu jab bhi talented logo ki baat krte hain. Tera transformation meine apne saamne dekha hai. First year me aaya hua banda jo pehle kafi kam baat kr pata tha ab mast convo carry karta hai.  You started programming aur ESC me A* le aaye. Explore krte krte kitne saare projects kr diye that you had to remove some of them from your resume :p. You started playing PUBG, and you literally (Ace)d it there. 
Everything that you tried, you have aced. And I am pretty sure ki aage jaake tu jis bhi chees me jayega you'll find your way to the top. I say that not only because you are talented but because you are fearless. Jaha hum log darr ke alag ho jaate the, you have been the 'Jo hoga dekha jayega' types.

Sorry to have ditched you at the bus stand :p Humesha regret rahega uska xD
You are the guy jo humesha wing calls me join karta hai. Wing ko aise hi connected rakhna bro.
You are the guy jiske saath college ke baad bhi kabhi touch nhi chutega. ",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a414fe819323d199d48074,Shobhit  Sachan
10,"Yo Sunit!
One of the most enthu wala banda of our wing. Someone who always worked hard to achieve success in life. You have always been the explorer type. I still remember first year me health issues ke karan ghar jaana pada tha but you covered the time lost. I will always remember you as the chill guy who made wing gatherings more fun. Keep in touch bro!",Archit  Awasthi,True,60a56d69819323d199d4864f,Sunit  Gautam
