Tumhare bina to TA ka project hi nhi ban pata mera, aur DS to bhul hi jao! My interactions with you have helped me immensely in controlling my temper and tum jitna screw up karte ho, utna to hum bhi karte hain! (RIP LOL ka 3 win streak). Thailand trip ka plan kabhi banayenge, pool, shota, you and me, aur kabhi web cafe me LOL chalayenge. Its been a great 4 years and we're going to make this last!",Shreyas  Potdar,True,60a64b56819323d199d48dbc,Piyush  Singh
1,"Shota kun! Introducing you to K media was the best mistake of my life! The random bulla sessions in your room, raat ki 2 baje waali DOAA canteen ki maggi and all the card games we had are among the greatest memories of my time at Kanpur. Yaar, bas 4th year bhi mil jaata, alag kaand karte! We need to go on more trips to kab ka plan banana hai?",Shreyas  Potdar,True,60a626c5819323d199d48b3a,Subham Kumar Hota
2,"LOL, quite literally! But seriously, the best things we did together were gaming and eating, yaad hai all the pizza and BBQ? Hamesha hum non-veg waalon ka choona kata tha! Kabhi to DST bhi chalaloooo! Agli baar Thailand trip, kyunki Goa humare naseeb me hai hi nhi, and 100 ki lose streak ko lfegoal bana lete hain!",Shreyas  Potdar,True,60a6498c819323d199d48d9e,Sudhanshu Pratap Singh
