Yaad hai tujhe, first year ke end mein donon ke bhaiyon ne dhokha diya tha agle saal room share karne se. Aur phir uske baad hm donon mile the 😅. Dukh mein ek dusre ke saathi!!! Phir uske baad first year summer, 2nd year, 3rd year, bas tu hin tha mujhe jhelne wala ek. 😂
Tmlog kitna MM khelte the, aur mujhe uske controls tatti lagte the. Although hmlogon ne badminton, PUBG, cards, Monopoly, aur pata nahin kya kya saath mein khela hai.
2018 summer mein donon saath mein kaam kiye the on that full-stack development project. Kitni mehnat se tune apna naam dalwaya tha... Aur last day pe BBQ mein party ki thi hmlogon ne 😎.
Then tera fitness enthu, jo 2nd year mein jaaga. Aur tune 5K bhi bhaag liya!
PUBG mein toh phod dete the sab, jab bhi khelte the saath mein 😎.
Film club mein bhi donon saath mein the. Y18 ki orientation video editing ki puri zimmedari mere aur tere par chhor di gayi thi 😅. Although Parshad ne end mein help kiya tha... Par woh bana baht bakchod tha 😎.
Then Galaxy aayi. Aur uss saal toh galaxy jeetna izzat waali baat ho gayi thi hall ke liye. Arun aur bachchon ke saath milkar woh bhi kaafi achchhe se handle kar liya tha apan donon ne 😅. Galaxy trophy bhi lekar aaye the, aur Film club ki trophy bhi 🤩. Although sem thukwa liya tha uss samay...
Third year mein tu toh apna yoga guru ban gaya tha 😅😅😅. Aise karo, yeh karo, isse yeh hoga, usse woh hoga, ... 🙇🏻‍♂️. Aur saath mein diet planner. Tera woh white board par likha hua ""kachcha chaba ja"" ab bhi wahin likha hai 🤣.
Tere saath wali Lucknow trip was very memorable. Although non-veg khane ke liye tune mujhe akela chhor diya tha 😕. Aur han, uss shaam ko kaise bhul sakte hain. You went into a mall, changed from jeans to shorts. And then returned back to kanpur in those shorts only 🤣. Telling that these are more comfortable...
Phir teri knee problem and then we saw a completely different Ashish in front of us. Your dedication to come out of it was marvelous. Ab toh tu fitness freak ban gaya hai 😅, spending most of your time in gym. Waise ghar mein hin gym kholne ka mera idea tha mast 😎. Ab hme bhi free ka gym gyaan dete rehna 😜.
Waise ek afsos zaroor hoga. Tmse last month mil nahin paane ka... But still, aage milenge toh zaroor mere dost 🙌🏻. Phir party karenge...

All the best for the future bro. Aise hin MACHATE raho. Aur hme bhul mat jana 😅.",Ravi  Kumar,True,60a61121819323d199d489e4,Ashish Kumar Singh
1,"Yo Apple boi!!!
Hm donon third year mein mile the. Tu tha dusre wing ka, par uss year mera neighbour ban gaya tha 😜.
Waise jab bhi woh phase yaar karta hun, ek hin baat dhyaan aati hai. Main tere room mein aata tha aur tu blanket ke andar leta/baitha rehta tha. Kabhi kabhi toh game ki aawaz aati thi Mobile se, baaki time pata nahin kya karta tha 🤣.
Then DBMS mein same team. Although project finalization ke alawa kuchh nahin kiye usme saath mein. All credit goes to the covid. 
Shukra hai Lucknow trip pe saath gaye the apan. Pure din idhar udhar ghuma tha. Baht maze kiye the maine, tune, aashish aur kg ne. Although dusra planned trip (Rajasthan one) ke liye tu itna excited tha, aur end mein aane se mana kar diya 😕. 
Then Amazon internship together. Although we were in different teams. Amazon ke MacBook ka baht utilisation kiya tha tune 😂. Itna pasand aa gaya ki placement hin Apple mein lagwa li... 😎
Placement semester was very exhausting. Par har baar mera first point of discussion tu hin hota tha. Kitne discussions karte the be saath mein!!! 
Lekin placement ke day 1 slot 1 ki kahani nahin bhulunga main kabhi. Kitna RR kiya tha tune be ki kisi mein shortlist nahin ho raha. Aur bc day 1 slot 2 ki har company mein shortlisted tha. Even slot 1 shuru hone se pehle call karke bol raha tha ki ""soch raha hun na baithun. Kuchh hona jana hai nahin!!! Bas Apple mein hin hai."" 🤣 And then boom!!! Offer unhone hin de diya. After the offer, you were like - ""sab maze maze mein interview de diya bhai"". Maze maze mein kitna chaap deta hai tu bhai 😅.
Then phase aaya campus mein last month ka. Raat ke woh campus walks aur sabke itne saare treats. Tera woh kg ke saath samosa fight 🤣. Tera kamar-dard, finger fracture, kya kya karwa liya tha tune 😜. 
Aur phir woh party, jab itna kuchh lene ke baad bhi bolta hai bhai kuchh nahin ho raha mujhe 🤣. Heave driver nikla re tu toh. Milo kabhi, capacity testing hogi teri...
Aur han, Randomised Algo!!! Bhai, tm aur Prajwal na hote toh kya hota uss course mein 😅. Maze maze mein woh bhi saath mein nikal diya apan ne 😌.

Baaki, future ke liye all the best bro 🙌🏻. Milte rehna, yaad karte rehna aur contact mein rehna. 

PS: Apple ke products pe special discount dilwana mat bhulna 😜.
Aur han, ""WANT SOME MILK?"" 😂",Ravi  Kumar,True,60a6020a819323d199d488f5,Geetam
2,"Yo KG bro!!! 😅
Mujhe nahin lagta ki tujhe koi tere pure naam se bulata bhi hoga... Yaad hai, ""Hall 9 + KG"", ""Hall 12 + KG"" 🤣. 
Hmlog IISc Bangalore mein pehli baar dhang se mile the, second year ke end mein. Mast chill banda tha be tu. Koi tension hin nahin. Roz lunch karne Prakriti jaate the. Aur even MG road, CTR, Mathikere, Delhi mess, Orion Mall, KFC, Nandi hills, ... The list is so long yaar!!! Bounce toh sabse pehle dhundhta tha tu 🤣. Aur han, tere ghar ke bane hue laddu. Baht yaad aayengi unki...
Phir hmlog wapas campus aaye and then kudos!!! Same hin wing mein aa gaye phir 😅. Phir you and me became the common link to join this quarter of the wing to the next half part. 
Phir toh late night canteens aur night bullas... Still remembered ki tujhe kayi baar raat ke 1:55 pe bhi log uthate the aur tu canteen jaane ke liye neend se uth jata tha. Teri yeh aadat baht cute lagti thi mujhe.
Phir hmlogon ki Lucknow ki trip plan hui. Baht maze kiye maine, tune, Geetam ne aur Ashish ne. At that time I got to know ki yeh banda kitna selfie lover tha. Jahan mauka milta tha, bas selfies lene ruk jata tha 😅. I loved that part of you my friend. Kaafi memorable raha tha woh trip.
Phir woh Antaragni mein Holi dance. Tera unique dance step 😜. Har kisi ko yaad hai woh toh.
Phir aaya Rajasthan trip. Tune aur Geetam ne hin convince kiya tha mujhe aane ke liye, although baad mein Geetam mukar gaya. But the trip yaar 💖💖💖. Aise hin plan karke chal diye the and then kaafi sahi ghum liya tha hmne 3 cities/towns. All thanks to Nishant for being our host. Wahan bhi you were indulged in selfies most of the time. Camel safari, bike ride in Jaisalmer, night bike tour in the open desert, all were very memorable. 
Waise han, petrol apna hamesha bach hin jata hai rented bikes/scooties mein 😅. Chahe hm Bangalore mein ho, ya Rajasthan mein.
Last one month in the campus was also great. Pehla point hua karta tha tu - ""KG, mess chalega?"", ""KG, canteen chalega?"", ""KG, Hall 9 chalega?"" 😂. Saath mein holi, treats, night walks, OAT mein bulla, cards, special party, .... Baht maze aaye the tere aur baakiyon ke saath. Aur joint banana toh art hai, jo sikhna pada, taaki tu kuchh naya experience kar paaye 😅.
Waise tera woh dance Sachin ke room mein. The list is soooo long.

Par jo bhi ho bro, tu baht achchha aadmi hai. Aur chaapu toh hai hin (dassa boy!!!). Ek paper abhi publish ho gaya hai, aage bhi aise hin machate raho. All the best for you life ahead my friend! 🙌 Jald hin milenge apan.

Aur han, teri Taj mein treat due hai 😅. Aa toh hm zaroor jayenge... Till then, take care.

3,"Yo Mr. H G San!!!
I knew you from the first year bro. Badminton mein kaise tm harate the mujhe. Aur Galaxy mein tere vocals...
Tu group ka woh banda tha jo har cheez ke starting mein baht enthu mein rehta tha, par woh enthu end tk pata nahin kahan chala jata tha. 
Also, tu woh banda tha mere liye, jo almost har course mein mera grp partner ban hin jaata tha 😅 (except one I think). Pata nahin tu na hota toh mere department courses kaise nikalte 🤣. 
Chhote mote trips pe toh hmlog jaate rehte the kanpur mein. Lekin last year mein Rajasthan trip ❤️❤️❤️. Aise hin kuchh bhi plan karke nikal gaye the sab aur phir sab achchhe se execute hota chala gaya bas aur hmne 3 cities/towns achchhe se ghum liya... All thanks to Nishant for being our host.
Par tera Lucknow jane wala dhokha nahin bhulunga main. Plan karke subah mana kar diya tha l**u ne. Aur bolta hai yeh kathi rolls le ja. Raaste mein kaam aayenge 😒😒😒.
Anime lover toh tu tha hin. Also, you were the only guy jisko meri Japanese samajh mein aati thi 😂. I think tera anime craze hin tera enthu down kar diya karta tha har cheez mein. Zyada hin chill marne lagta tha tu 😜. Aur tujhe dekhkar main bhi kaafi chill marne laga life mein 🤣.
Late night badminton games, even during the exams, were the most relaxing period. 2nd year mein kitna PUBG khelte the be hmlog 🤣🤣🤣. You, me, ashish, reithick, chanchal, nishant, shubham... Jahan utarte the, chicken dinner mil hin jata tha 🙌🏻😎.
Waise tujhse mere jhagde bhi kaafi hue. Har baar tu hyper hone lagta tha. But I think main situation sambhal liya karta tha 😜.
Waise kitne hair transitions kiye be tune... First year mein normal hair, then no hair, then very long hair, then different colors on the hair, then normal hair and back to no hair!!! Tera pata nahin, par tere baal baht rangeen the re baba 🤣.
Chalo, 1 saal aur baaki hai tmhara toh. Kuchh kaand karoge kahin toh call toh mujhe hin karoge sabse pehle 😂. Intezaar rahega unn calls ka.
Baaki, future ke liye all the best bro! 🙌🏻
Although tu academically baht achchha nahin kar paya apne laziness ke kaaran, but you are a genius man. Life mein aage phodte rehna aur MACHATE rehna. 
Jald hin milenge bro! Till then, take care... 

PS: Netflix ke liye yaad karte rehne 😜.",Ravi  Kumar,True,60a5d497819323d199d48791,Prajwal H G
4,"Do you really think that your maths is strong?? 😜
Maine nahin socha tha ki hamara first year ka Raju Inter-IIT Weighlifting mein sabko dhul chata dega...
Waise tere mess extras nahin bhul sakta main, jiske bill dekhkar pura hall shocked rehta tha. Kuchh dozens Eggs toh as if snacks the tere liye... 😜😜🤣 Aur jahan koi tere extras pe haanth dale, tu bhadak jata tha 🙄
Waise tu hai baht mehnati (padhne ko chhorkar 😁😎). Tera training dedication dekhkar main bhi dedicated rehta tha, lekin kuchh ukhad nahin paya in 4 saalon mein.
Tere itne zabardast muscles the, infact hain ab bhi. But still your dedication for them repelled all the girls around you (muscles ka koi fayda nahin hua 🤣🤣)
Tere saath ke birthday trips bhi kaise bhul sakte hain. Hamesha tu hin auto-driver ke saath jo baithta tha 👀
Kabhi kabhi cards, badminton, uno aur monopoly khelne bhi aa jata tha. Par jeetne ke liye tera sangharsh sada yaad rahega mere dost. Tere Monopoly wale deals kabhi nahin bhulunga, jo ki hamesha tere liye double beneficial hote the aur mujhe reject karne padte the... 😢
Waise jo bhi bolo, apna Raju hai baht bhola-bhala. Hatta-katta tha zaroor, par kabhi kisi pe misuse nahin kiya darane-dhamkane ke liye.
Ummeed hai Raju bada aadmi bankar ab bhul nahin jaayega. 
Wish you all the best for your future endeavours!!!

5,"Hello Gupta ji!
Tujhse pehli jaan pehchan hui thi Saurav ke roommate ke taur par. Phir toh silsila chalta hin chala gaya. 
Badminton games baht khele the apan log saath mein. 
Sabse zyada maze toh aakhiri month mein milkar kiya, when we both were in the same block. Monopoly khelna ho, cards khelne ho, aise hin chill karna ho, many problems, one solution - Sachin ka room!!! (Double room milne ka kuchh toh faayda uthaye baaki log 😜)
Night disco hota tha tera room 🤣. Although tera external speaker tatti tha 😜.
Aur haan, woh apni zordaar aakhiri party 😏😏😏. Jab tune apna asli roop dikhaya tha 😜🤣😂. Socha nahin tha ki tu itna heavy driver niklega... 

Chalo, that phase has ended. And a new phase of life is waiting for you ahead. All the best for the future. Jamkar machate raho. Mauka mila toh jald hin milenge bro 🙌🏻

PS: Tera ek mast dialogue wala video hai, jo uss raat tune bola tha 😜, par tune agle din use sunne se mana kar diya tha. Mauka milne par use bhi release karenge... 😌

6,"Kitne cheezein saath mein ki thi hmne!!!
Starting from first year astro events (although we were opponents 😜) --> First year ke summers ki 40 days ki conditioning by the Adventure club --> 5K, 8K, 10K --> shopping trip to Lucknow for buying trek items from Decathlon --> Hampta pass trek --> 2nd year mein donon Astro club ke secy --> conducting Mandakini in Techkriti...
Iske baad toh tm gaayab se hin ho gaye the 😅 (7 sem mein hin graduate hone mein)
Coming to the conditioning, yes it was very tough in the beginning. Bina ruke toh 2 rounds bhi mushkil se hote the 🤣. But then our dedication helped us through all that. At the end, we used to do 12 rounds (4 with stairs). Remembered Mahesh ji and Rahul!!! 😅😅😅 Jo bhi kaho, hm donon ne ek dusre ko baht support aur motivate kiya tha 5K, 8K aur 10K pura karne mein.
Now the Lucknow trip! You were damn excited for eating at Tunday Kababi 🤤. We did lot of shopping from Decathlon and then we executed our plan of lunch at Tunday 😁😁😅.
Then the Hampta pass trek... Man, it was so adventurous, exciting and fun there. Aur tera woh experience at the park with that baba 🤣. I can still quote it in your words - ""Aaj ka experience share karne laayak hai. Main ek forested park mein tha with the group and ek masale aur jaribooti waala hme follow karne laga and then aise hin baat karte hue bolta hai 'Bhaiya, shil*j**t le lijiye... Ek saath 3-3 ko thaka denge. Dandi bilkul aisi ho jaayegi...'. Main peechhe murkar yeh dekha nahin ki Dandi kaisi ho jaayegi. I was like... Kyaaaaa????"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Par jo bhi kaho, those 5 days out there in the nature with you and others are one of the most memorable memories of my life. 
Phir Astro mein kaafi kuchh Kiya saath mein. Although, tmlog takneek jeet gaye the 😕. But all of it was very memorable.
Baaki aage ke liye all the best dost! Jaldi se good news sunana UPSC ka. Tu achiever hai hin. Mujhe zyada bolne ki zaroorat nahin 😅.

7,"Hey Reithick da!!! 😅
I knew you very less in the first year, except playing badminton with you and knowing that you were such a great bowler. I think it was the period just before the first year summer when we started knowing each other in a better way.
And after that, we stayed very close till the 4th year (all thanks to the hall change at the last moment after the quarantine period 😅🤩).
I still remember, you were the guy whom people used to say anything in hindi, even abusive words, and you didn't have any clue even as what they were saying 😂. Although later, your determination to learn some hindi helped you a lot man.
Waise how can I forget that summer incident. When we both went to buy something from z-square and you bought a dress for your present-ex, whose payment was done by me. And I had to wait for the next 2 years to get that back, that also in installments 😅.
We even remembered you HTC phone, the lightest in our grp, which you were proud of 😜.
You were a guy who went through many ups and downs in the life but was dedicated enough to convert that phase into a memorable opportunity. Dassa, cricket, ...
I liked your simplicity man and your thirst to strive for the best you can. 
How can I forget the TA202 end-sem exam 😅. Hope you remembered 😜. Thanks for that yaar 😁.
Btw, everyone in our grp would agree on this that you were the most irresponsible person of the group 🤣. Still you used to manage the things. 
Playing late night badminton games, cards, going on trips with all (when you used to come late everytime 😜), long walks, your fundas, your random theories and discussion on them, ... (the list is very long). I will always remember all these yaar.
We made so many plans for Bangalore yaar!!! You, me, Ashish and Prajwal. The best was the go karting. All thanks to this covid situation that we haven't executed that 🤦🏻‍♂️. But hope to meet soon there and execute each of our plans....
In the quarantine period, you were like an angel for me 🥺. Although you had to stay for one more week of quarantine which deprived you from playing holi with us 😕.
On the last day in the campus, it was very tough to bid farewell to you. But jo bhi ho, you taught me to stay positive in the life 🙌🏻.

Now, I think it's getting very long 😅. So, let me wrap it up.
All the best for your future bro!!! You are an achiever and a talented guys. This will remain with you for very long (maybe till the end). 
We will meet soon after this pandemic gets over. Till then, take care.

PS: I want a new goggles from you now for the one which you lost.
