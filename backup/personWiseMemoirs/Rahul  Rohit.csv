0,"Ananta bhai, you are probably the most sincere-towards-acads person I met on campus. You have an exemplary work ethic and a strive to learn, jisne na jaane kitno ke MTH courses bachaye h first year mein. Apne C6 mein probably tere ""earnest request"" ke wajah se hi ""academic environment"" maintained tha lol. 
A true diehard cricket fanatic and probably the most devoted KKR fan there is, I will never forget our cricket discussions on the mess table. First year mein double dasse ke baad we got to meet the true you, a party animal with a larger-than-life personality. Please never ever change that... all the very best for ahead, you are bound to go places.
P.S. first sem ke aeromodelling workshop mein selfie contest ke naam pe jo fraud maara tha tumne, kbahi nahi bhulunga lmao. Cheers buddy.",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5b26d819323d199d48767,Ananta  Mukherjee
1,"Jab tune first year ke aeromodelling workshop mein fraud maara tha, to garner likes on a stupid selfie contest, mujhe ummeed nahi thi ki tu 1 din GS pahuch jayega xD. Probably the most active and social person in our wing, you were almost always the initiator of our wing plans. Most trips couldn't manage to see the light of the day, but our Lucknow and Goa trips are etched in memories forever. Started with loco, pubg, moved on to mafia, poker, skribbl, and finally 28 and judgement, your involvement in these games was a given. I am very proud you started watching The Office and football games (because of me xD). And tera legendary ""TOH?!"" toh yaad hi h sabko lol.
Aage bhi chaapte reh, hasste reh and sabko Gujarati farsaan khilaate reh. Also, aage ki trips bhi tu hi plan kar ra. Cheers mate, stay in touch!",Rahul  Rohit,True,60a5bb68819323d199d4876f,Anuj Mayurkumar Shah
