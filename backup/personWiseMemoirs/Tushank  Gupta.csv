0,"I remember our first interaction, "" Hi Akash, Departmental Freshers Night ke coupons dena""... fir tere saath IME ka course, and Real Data Miner aap hai. Couldn't forget how you start calling ""data miner- data miner"" from miles.... those  were days <3. You are man with potential and know how to use, hats off to your dedication.
You are one of the most reliable person I ever met in m life, always up to help and start some randi-rona xD. Those RR were good some times and I and Jd got lot of fun with you and in your RR. ""Yaar Gangwar itna RR karta hai, even sabse chaapu banda hai yeh"".
Placement preparation with you was the finest and couldn't have been better, thanks for those, you kept motivated me during my lows. And tumhe treat deni hai mujhe aur jd ko highest ctc ki :p. 
Antragini ki wo bakchodi bhulaye nahi bhulti, bohot judgment kia tha humne, kudos to us!!! 
And teri wo motivational line(Antragini wali) epic hai xD   ""Jo wo kar rhe wo koi bhi kar lega, but jo hum kar rhe wo koi nahi kar paega"". 

Gurgaon chalte hai saath me bhai, abhi aur bhi bohot dher memories banani hai..... Loved your spirit man....<3 <3 <3",Tushank  Gupta,True,6099667c819323d199d47951,Akash  Gangwar

2,"Hello Roomie, you were the first guy at IITK to whom I interacted and first conversation me laga yeh banda bakchod intellectual hai, and that image will always hold true. 
Bas tu treat me kam aaya, but jitne me aaya wo bakchod the... tere punch lines mast rehti thi. 
I admire your discipline, daily taekwondo jana, running ke liye, punctuality is admirable.
Thanks for the all-time when you supported me in my rough patches like an elder brother. I never had an elder brother in real life and I never missed that role at IITK, thanks to you man <3 and hopefully aage bhi kabhi wo kami mehsoos nahi hone dega tu. 
You are a man with a solution to every problem. Thanks for everything and call karte rahenge and touch me rahenge bhai!!! <3

3,"~~Aao tumhe ""Closure"" dete hai...(while listening Mahi Ve by AR Rehman)~~

Dear Prateek,
I hope this ""closure"" finds you safe and well. 

It's been four years since I came across your acquaintance, and my first impression still fits very well.  A guy with a set motive, focussed towards goal, hard-working, and one who can sleep on anyone's bed except on his own.
You are the man who can go push himself to whatever extent to achieve his goals, still, remember how you rote the whole sociology book. 
Thanks for sharing wholesome stories and also thanks to that you don't have an account on insta, otherwise udhar bhi same story dekhni padti :p

Will miss ""25min me utha dena"", perhaps tum kabhi uthate bhi nahi the. Sorry ki Udghosh me Atif Aslam nahi bulaye ham xD. 
You are great with advice and I admire how seriously understand and help to figure the best possible solution(excluding the relationship's one :p).

We had a great time, thanks for being an extended roommate... enjoyed your company a lot.

Let's meet soon and catch up for more ""Toh"" moments...
All the Best! 
आशा करते है भारतीय एलोन मस्क आप ही बने! 

Regards,
Tushank

4,"Bhai kya shayari aur lines likhta hai tu... mast fan hai aapke sir _/\_ Bohot mast time spend kia hai humne last 2 months, bc endless bulla kata hai high ho kar. Kya gyaan pele hai saath me xD. 
Thoda sa regret iss baat ka hai ki humne kam time saath me spend kia, aur bohot karna tha saath me bu thoda hi regret hai kyunki delhi me milte rahenge naa... weekend par party aur high hone ke liye Baba Dindor ko yaad kiya jaega.
Mast chill aadmi hai tu, first me apna mast tha Soc171A ke saath... dono class jaate nahi the, jaate the toh bc wahi so jaate the. Alag bakchodi ho rhi thi. 

Mast knowledge hai tere par bro. Bhai mast chaap ke prep karna tu, dilli me milte rehna... Best of Luck!!! Bole toh macha dena!!",Tushank  Gupta,True,609ad13d819323d199d479b9,Rochak  Dindor
5,"Yo Nadda! Coaching ke din bakchod the yaar, vishnoi ki class me so jane se lekar aur bhi bohot kuch karne tak. And campus days were more lit! First sem tere bagal baith ke hi nikal dia mai, padha toh kuch nahi but baate bohot kari. It was fun and comfortable.
Working in Udghosh was good experience with you. Never mentioned earlier but yeh aankh dikha ke baat karne wali kya bakchodi hai xD. All the trips and restro visits are some of the best memories I am carrying with myself from campus. 

Milte hai jald hi, bakchodi karne chalenge... Best of Luck for future endeavors.",Tushank  Gupta,True,60a41509819323d199d48075,Saransh  Nadda
6,"Yo Riya! First time we interacted in a group, although I don't have very clear memory but I can make sure it must have been good, although first time coaching me dekha tha :p
We had amazing trips, sab mast log mile trip, you guys made it worth it. Agra, Jaipur, Banaras will feel incomplete without our group.  Thanks for tolerating my little stubborn behavior. Sorry not sorry for not coming to bhu campus, lol!
I had some of the best bulla sessions with you. Thanks for helping out in ""those"" times, giving time selflessly meant a lot to me. I had amazing company with you. Thanks for listening bakwaas of mine, waise aage bhi sunata rahunga :P

Cities alag honge but trips ke liye milte rahenge and also for butter chicken and garlic naan, video call will be continued and ab screen par hi dekhunga xD. 

All the best for your goals! Rock it!!!",Tushank  Gupta,True,60a4134a819323d199d4806f,Riya  Katiyar
7,"I am feeling nostalgic and cherished that I shared the room with you. Words limit me to describe our bond, wish could be easier to pour feelings on a keypad. 
It was a good intro with you in the first year, and how we used to spend time together in libraries, canteen and in endless bulla session at your room. My impression after few interactions was this guy is focused, consistent and hard-working, and I was goddamn right. You are a man with values.
Bhai humne bohot ladai kari, logo se bhi lade saath me(whether on badminton court or canteen me chair ke liye xD), those endless debates were a source of adrenaline for me... lol me!

Most important you are a very good teacher, kya mast samjhate the exams ke pehle... bc feel aa jati thi

We shared very good time together in college, I am thankful to you for holding and being with me in my rough patches, all those meant a lot... I was quite a noob, har baat par behas karne lagta tha... Sorry for those :( 

Best of Luck with your goals!!!
Jald hi milte hai... <3
