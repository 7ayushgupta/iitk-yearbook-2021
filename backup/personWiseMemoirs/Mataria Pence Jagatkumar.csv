26,"Bhai aap pehle the jiska dassa dekha tha humne. Apna wing cpi average average tha just because of you alone. In the start, we used to convince (forcefully) ourselves that you are a maggu but as time progressed we were again forced to change that perspective ki dassa wale bhi utne hi cool hote hai jitna baki log. That was an inspiration in itself. Then that Agra trips and tumhare parents ke samne JEE rank awkward situations, and aunty ka dantna, GPLs, Bulla sessions,  and the list goes on and on...Anyways we are always in touch. Starting mein wo startup ke thoughts are still very fresh. Agar kuch bhi karna hai,  just a call away😜.

The techmeet glory was a huge point in my life (not just due to standard reasons but it has something to do with past). And a Big big thanks to you for staying with me during that whole blissful period and keeping everyone motivated. Apke Priyank se liye hue aero notes kaafi kaam aye the. And AUV deserved you. Super impressed with your election move. If you remember, I once said that wanted to have a deep discussion with you on the same, though unfortunately never spared a time for that.

You were the first, I saw on campus that was a lot into Entrepreneurship. Not just E-Cell but in real.
