haa bhai, first year me to  kaphi time sath me bitaya tha. Yeah and I remember that peacock photo on doaa canteen, locking two cycles with one lock, searching for NCL labs for the first time... mast tel me machali fry karke khane wahi wali video ho to bhejana 😁. Baki time to gaming me hi nikal gaya, no regrets for that I guess, but wo time kisi better jagah bhi spent ho sakata tha. call me anytime if you ever want to play some games and don't know where to start 😊. Pata nahi tha ki tum bhi potterhead ho, ab tereko bhi uski memes bhejni padegi 😒. Anyway, let's meet again along this mysterious journey of life someday. ""The world is a cruel place but it's also very beautiful"", damn that came out of nowhere, nevermind. aur haa mereko hindi me likhana chahiya tha 🤣.",Deepak  Prajapati,True,60a65833819323d199d48e91,Ritesh  Kumar

Hello there,
sorry, this meme I found today had to go somewhere and no better place than to make someone smile, instead of writing some long-ass story about stuff that never happened(wish I spent more time with the bros), I am gonna leave here some poetry I found.

Bob opened up his chips in class, releasing cheesy air - His teacher asked, ""Is there enough so everyone can share?""

He didn't have enough within the bag that he had brought - He sighed as he replied, ""I'll look to see just what I've got.""

He stood and reached below and shoved his arm inside his ass - Bewildering his peers who sat disturbed inside class.

His teacher stared in horror and he didn't bat a lash, as Bob was digging deep to search his hidden anal stash.

And with a pop he pulled a bag, his ass gaped like a ditch - He said, ""Now there's enough for all, you commie fucking bitch.""

hope that made you laugh 😂😂,  edible stuff reminded me of chura(stuff made of rice as namkeen) that you used to bring from home. 🤣🤣. Lets meet again someday, somewhere....",Deepak  Prajapati,True,60a662a5819323d199d48f57,Shashank  Kumar
