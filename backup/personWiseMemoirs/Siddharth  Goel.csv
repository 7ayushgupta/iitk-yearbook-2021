We have been through so much, it is nearly impossible to write it all down in this. Bhai you are one of the most genuine and down to earth person I have seen in IITK, and I couldn't be happier to find you as a friend. Thanks for helping me all the times, be it in academics or keeping me sane when I lost the elections. Bhai tu jaan h aur raise hi rhna. Hopefully tu Bangalore aata rahega milne. 
Love you man.
P.S. yes I didn't recognize you in our first awkward meeting in CCD but well yea I made up for that. ",Siddharth  Goel,True,60a589a6819323d199d486f6,Akhilesh  Chauhan

Tu akela bnda h jiske chakkar mei hockey ke saare gam jhele jaate the. Kaafi hockey kheli apan ne aur kaafi kaam bhi kiye saath mei. Abhi bhi mujhe dhyaan h apan dono ko subah jldi uthke horse riding workshop sambhalni thi aur poore time tune mera saath diya tha. ❤️❤️
Couldn’t have asked for a better player and a teammate. Apna kaam krne ka attitude mat khona and all the best bhai. ",Siddharth  Goel,True,60a58e94819323d199d48709,Anshuman  Pal

We have come a long way from EE200 and I am so glad about it. I remember you being someone who would take everything way too seriously to someone who can chill out and still get shit done. So proud to see this growth :p (you can thank me later) 
Placements would have been impossible without you and thanks for keeping me sane when all was spiralling out of control. 
One thing I can never understand is how we passed all the DE, and are finally graduating. EE will always remain a mystery I guess. 
Kudos to the numerous theories we related to (especially the imposter syndrome one)
SBG is gonna be another amazing chapter where we’ll take the world for a ride. 
See ya soon. Take care. Love you man!!

Tumhare chakkar mei hi apan kaam karva paye poore Udghosh mei. Kya time tha pr fest waala, aur itni dikkato mei bhi acha manage to kr hi liya. Baki tumhare chakkar mei meine bhi wo blue wali drink banana seekh liya aur ab bartending ka course bhi kr liya XD. Baki to abhi apni parties to shuru hui h. Tum officer ban jao phir to poori life hi party h. Aise hi mast aadmi rhna and all the best man!!",Siddharth  Goel,True,60a58b3e819323d199d486fd,Utkarsh  Singh
