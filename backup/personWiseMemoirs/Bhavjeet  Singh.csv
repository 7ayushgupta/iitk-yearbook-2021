1,"Yooo! 
You are the most anti-me personality I have known at IITK. be it liking mechanical xD, the work ethic, positive attitude, getting things done the right way, not fucking things up, loved by all, The office lover :P and a 100 more things. 
Makes me wonder how the hell we relate so much on so many things. 
Thanks for being a saviour in all the ME courses, thanks for being in AnC, thanks for never calling me chutiya on my face, most of all, thanks for just being there when needed.",Bhavjeet  Singh,True,60a8d3b1819323d199d493c1,Suyash  Singh
