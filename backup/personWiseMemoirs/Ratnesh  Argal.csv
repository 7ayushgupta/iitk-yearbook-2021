5,"Hello Aishwarya Bhai.
Tumhara roll number find krne k liye student search pr tumhara naam search kiya, tum to ID card me bhi kafi stud lag rhe ho yaar 😎
Tum yaar really bht brave, daring (in other words ""khatro k khiladi"") types person ho. Fest k kuch din pehle jb ek core team member tumhare kaam me jyada hi interfere krne lage to tumne yaad h tumne kaha tha -""ab agar kuch bhi kaha to post chhod duga post aur challenge de duga mere bina event krwa sakte ho to krwa le"". This line itself ensures event me tumhara contribution kitna jyada tha and tumhe without interference work Krna hi pasand h.
Tumhari communication skills to ek dum gazab. Dream on and judges ko manipulate krne ki best ninja techniques h tumhare paas.  Itne pyar se apni दंतुरित muskurahat se jo serious bate keh diya krte ho e.g. ""no offense sir but theatre and bollywood wale sath me judge Krne me comfortable nhi hote to ap please...."". Adhi baat samne wala khud complete kr deta tha or request bina bole hi approve ho jati thi. Or MoU to itni fast banate the ki Quicksilver bhi piche reh jaye.
Sorry yaar, mujhe kahi n kahi lagta tha fest k time tum or another manager milke mujhe ignore kr rhe ho, lekin baad me realise hua, ye sab bas work pressure ki wajah se tha. Shayad us time itni maturity nhi thi😅.
Antaragni 19 me Street plays k results declare hone se pehle hi hm dono ko pata chal gya tha, IITK first tha. Lekin excitement kharab nhi ho isiliye hmne kisi ko bataya nhi. 
Jaise hi result declare hua tumhara eyes se tears of joy nikal gye. Tb mujhe realise hua tumhara club se kitna jyada attachment h.

I will also remember you as a great performer bhai. Stage plays me tumhari performances, Galaxy ka nukkad 'ye dharti meri ma h' almost puri tumhari hi me mehnat thi. Bhale hi 2 dialogue milte pr Bahot man tha 4th year wala stage play sath me krne ka. 
Qualities to tum me itni h ki batate rhuga to word limit rok degi. 
All the very best bhai. I believe tum jis bhi field me kadam rakhoge, chap doge. अंत में हमारी यही दुआ है कि आप जीवन में सफलता के नए कीर्तिमान स्थापित करे।
