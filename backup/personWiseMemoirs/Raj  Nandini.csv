0,"Hey abha!! We spent only a few times together but that was enough for me to know that you are truly the sweetest person!!! I still remember those stressful nights we spent doing the CHE352 project and us whining together XD Ab samajh aa rha hai us stress me bhi ek maza tha :p (par ab aur nhi chahiye waisa maza :p) Thanks for being such a good and helpful friend!! <3 Stay the sweet, cheerful, and hardworking person you are. I wish all the best things for you. Hope we get to meet again someday!! 😊",Raj  Nandini,True,60a21cca819323d199d47ccd,Abha  Tamrakar
1,"Hey digu!! One of the sweetest and cutest boi I met on campus (aur last me ek mahine me dekha to one of the most handsome boi too 😳🥵) I don't generally feel comfortable with new people but I never felt conscious or awkward around you!! It was always fun with you and onbin, be it when we shared a mamamio shake or in the library. Thanks for spreading so much positivity and wholesomeness around you <3 But still apna kitna kuch karna reh gya... jaise doing the kawaiii dance (don't know if you still remember this but we started the kawaiii club XD) aur sath me baddy ya volley khelna bhi :( But I hope we get to do those things someday and I hope vo din jald aaye. I'll definitely miss you :') Take care <3",Raj  Nandini,True,60a3acd2819323d199d47f31,Digumarthi Komal Emmanuel Raju
2,"Hemlo bhemx 😊 Still so thankful to whoever was responsible for making me change my TA202 group at the very last moment and go with Yashika's group and that we met XD. Honestly, I don't have any memory of you in TA202 or how and when we became friends!! I just remember how we superbrozz used to go on treats and walks and it was so fun. From having a similar sense of humor(or you can say same sense of humor since you know, you campy me 🥱), getting judged by others for laughing at weird things, judging and disliking the same people, making up words and our ""lenguez"" XD, we just became best friends :). I already miss you so much :') going on late night walks, our movie nights, or having some of favorites of campus like ""chomccy room ka mansala mamggie"", mamamio shakes (oreo >>>>>>strawberry), mysori dosa, and chickblast :'). You are one of the most fun, genuine, and helpful person I met on campus and one of my closest friend. I'll always cherish the time we spent together and hope we meet very very soon!!! There's so much more to write but ok I can't fit all here (I'll just keep them a ciggo 😆😉). Stay safe, smol and chomk. ",Raj  Nandini,True,608aed0a819323d199d470bb,Abhishek  Sharma

4,"Hey! It's true we both being introverts never bothered to interact with each other but I'm glad we did. Thanks for being such a good friend!! Thanks for all the help you did, and hope I can be just as helpful to you, if not more. It's quite inspiring to see how much dedication and passion you have for acads (so thanks for that as well 😁). I wish you get all the things you deserve and more. Hoping for some good times in this one year of dual. Till then stay safe and take care!",Raj  Nandini,True,60a20839819323d199d47cb5,Anirban  Ghosh
5,"Yo behen!! yaar apna first sem kaafi acha beeta sath me but sadly uske baad we never got that much time together... first sem me to aadat hogyi thi mujhe, logo ko mujhe chitra ke naam se bulata sunne ki XD lagne laga tha mera dusra naam chitra hi hai!! Infact some people used to call me by your name till 2nd year!!! Kaafi mazedaar baatein hui humari first year me :p Kam hi sahi par jitna bhi time beetaya tere sath sare bahot mazedaar the!! Thank you for the good times!!!
Aur haa us din mess me maza aaya tha XD par tune abhi tak bataya nhi mujhe apna pura!! I'm still waiting !!! 🙄 Stay the fun person you are. Hope we get to meet someday. <3",Raj  Nandini,True,60a20cb8819323d199d47cbc,Chitranshi  Singh
6,"Helloooooooo !!! Never thought I'd meet such an important person when I first came to IITK. From being roommates to best friends to being sisters ( just like aunty says that we are inseparable XD), we still have a long way to go... ab to dono ki family bhi friends ban gye hai XD. I'm so thankful that we got to know each other and became friends on the very first day of college itself. Love your ""kalaam jokes"" and you making any convo cringe and dirty XD. Looking forward to many beautiful days with you!! love you my bestiee!! <3 😊",Raj  Nandini,True,608b08f8819323d199d47113,Maitreyee  Srivastava
7,"Hemlo Monishaaa!!!! (henlo bhi update kardiya hai humne XD) Yaar sach me it was always so much fun with you!! Remember? main raste me jate rehti thi aur tu dikh jati thi paidal chalte aur phir main tujhe lift deti thi aur taane bhi ki monisha kab seekhegi cycle tu!!!! XD Or the other good times we had together, some treats and other random meetings (generally library :p)!! All this made me realize that you truly are the sweetest person ever!!! sach me !!! And unconsciously hi sahi but somehow tere sath I've become a better person... thank you for that <3 I wish we had some more time together but koi nhi... we'll meet soon !!! Stay the perfect person you are and I'm gonna miss you. 
Love you too <3",Raj  Nandini,True,60a39bc2819323d199d47eff,Manisha  Meena
8,"Zazuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!! kya hi likhu tere baare me main! We literally have been inseparable from the beginning!! Be it our obsession over common celebs, being defense buddies in volley, or in our laziness. We just click on everything!! You are the most relatable person for me because we basically are the same person!! ( remember how we used to be happy and tease each other when something happened to the other person :P)
 ""Dadu chal humdono hi one to one karte hai!! aaja isse pehle sir apne sath bula le humdono hi khelna shuru karte hai :')"".  You were there for me when I was feeling all alone even when I had the whole of the team with me, and just you being there, not saying a word but understanding what I was going through is enough to tell everything there is about our friendship. Thank you for that! <3
Words are not enough to explain what you and our friendship mean to me (although I explained everything on that night remember?? :P) I can share literally anything with you (and maitreyee, taking her name so that she doesn't kill me when she reads this :P), and this is something I have never done till now, sharing everything with anyone. I miss having long talks with you about anything and everything. Those are one of the best memories I have of IITK. :')
Meet me soon!!! And yes let's live together forever once we all get a job!!!! Because you know, I'm the reason you survived college 😌😚 Keep missing me (I know you do 🥰😉) ",Raj  Nandini,True,608e7acc819323d199d476f1,Prashansa  Dadu
9,"Hemlo PP !!!!!!! It took us almost 2 years to finally talk after knowing each other from the first semester XD!! When I first saw you in PE, I thought of you as a shy, quiet and simple guy, but boy was I wrong!! Knew you as just a spammer on FB but I'm glad that now we are the farzi frens😊. You are one of the most fun people I've met on campus. Kitna kuch hai funny chize apni jaise our lomve for doge and cheems, tera humesha mujhe kehna ""namdini convert to Islam"" (still don't know why), tera nonveg aur chimkin pe chhidna XD, office >>>> friends, our common besties (you know who :p). Holi'21 was really fun, thanks to you guys. Although campus me apni sath me zyada memories nhi hai but we'll make some in the 5th year for sure (agar campus bulate hai to :') ) isliye PP vaccine lele 😌. Tell Neha (Vyas) I said Hi!! 😊 ",Raj  Nandini,True,609ffb00819323d199d47b59,Pulkit  Pandey

11,"A simple, pure, lively, and fun-loving person. Utsob!!!!!!! I'm so thankful to have you as my friend. I've learned a lot from you on how to be a more friendly, better, and happier person (although you may not trust me, it's the truth). I'll always cherish the times we spent together and hope for more in the future. And yes, as you said, the journey of ChE would be incomplete for me as well without you. Infact, I can't imagine ChE without the superbrozz :'). Although college ended, it's not the end of our friendship for sure. I miss you so much :'( . Let's meet soon and have that trip we've been planning for so long XD. Till then take care and be safe! ",Raj  Nandini,True,608b0cd4819323d199d47114,Utsav  Akarshan
12,"Yonshhhhhh!!!! Glad I had you with me in ChE since the beginning. Went to the ChE freshers together by chance but who knew that it was the beginning of such a long friendship :'). Thanks for every little thing you did for me during these four years... Tu nhi hoti sath me to meri sari subha wali classes miss hoti XD thanks for not only waking me up but also motivating me to get out of bed and go to my classes. I still remember every little funny things we did together, going late to the first lecture of 381 (kaistha ke class me late!! vo bhi pehli class me XD aur phir sir ka hume daant ke sabse aage baithana), exams time library me tera dance karna (we still have the video of that), aur kitne random chize jo humne sath me kiya...(including judging some people together hehehe it was fun though 😌). I already miss you and our group together having fun and even the stressful exam times which was bearable and even quite because of you guys. Bas is baat ka afsos raha ki ek last bar campus me nhi mil paye chaaro log... But koi nhi we'll surely meet again soon!! very very soon!! Stay the positive, fun and  ""Main apni favorite hoon 🥰"" person that you are. Love you lots <3 
PS: Thanks for the name ""nach-nandini"" XD",Raj  Nandini,True,60a00d9c819323d199d47b66,Yashika
