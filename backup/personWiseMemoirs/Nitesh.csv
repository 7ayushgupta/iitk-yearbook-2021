6,"Hey,
we were doing the ENG112 course together but we never talk to each other. But After that, we met in the 3rd year for CE331 Lab and after that, we became good friends. Now I think that why I was not meet you in the first year. You are such a good human being and a very supportive and helpful friend. Thank you, for always helping me and encouraged me to do anything in my life. and also thank you for your help in the exams, quizzes, assignments, and also for your UPSC tips. I will miss our long discussion after the exam and before the exam(it's a different thing that our discussion was never related to the exam😀)
Will meet you soon.",Nitesh,True,60a4d438819323d199d4821d,Prince  Kumar
7,"Hey Area😛, 
We know each other since our first year. In the first year, we went to classes, lab everywhere together also we always found different ways to go to the academic area.  we have lots of talk about assignments, profs, courses and also lots of things. And also thank you for always helping me😍 with assignments, quizzes, and everything. I will miss those long talks about many things, going to eat chat in front of hall 3, and also sitting together in the class.
and yes we need lots of photographs together😀.
will see you soon❤️. ",Nitesh,True,60a4c93f819323d199d481ec,Riya  Katiyar
