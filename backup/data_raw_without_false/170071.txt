That \\"Woooooo\\" voice will be missed a lot. Still the party of ESC201A is pending, and I am writing this on my diary. Thank you for saving our 31680 Rs., else meri gaand tod di jaati. It was a moment of grief that you weren\'t able to come with us to Goa, but we did Rajasthan together.\\nSpending time playing Among Us, was the best part of that quarantine period. Making fake tinder IDs xD although you should say sorry to that guy named Utkarsh \\"bechare k 2 baar lol\\".\\nAll in all, it was great time spent together. I kindly request you to please stay in touch and meet whenever you are in Kanpur or I am in Delhi, so that we can live once again on nostalgia.\\n\\nTill that Ciao.\\n\\nThank You,\\nCheems (Meme King lol)\\n","author":"Harshit  Verma","visibility":true,"_id":"608539c7819323d199d46dc1"},{"text":"Bhai honestly.... mjaa bht aaya tm log k sath me.... kaise time nikla kbhi pta nhi chla.... chapu ho bhai... chapte rho... kbhi kbhar hmko bhi yad kr lena....

One thing that sums it all up: I probably won\'t be going wherever I am going without you. Loved preparation with u, and our winter camps were the highlights of my life (though god knows I sucked at competitive tennis, it was a lesson learnt. I wont ever go to tournaments again lol). To a glucose-mixing heathen in your first year, summer camps and winter camps and the endless tennis court days, you were a part of the only part of this place I ever enjoyed. Keep in touch, or I shall probably end up kicking your ass.
