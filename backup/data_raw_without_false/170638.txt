You had asked me whether we need to worry if our internships in the US will be affected because of covid.   At that time, covid had just reached India and we were still traveling without any mask.  Many things changed after that week.  We had received the mail from TAMU that our internships had been rescinded.  All our plans of spending time together at TAMU were ruined. If not for covid, I am sure that we would have connected really well.   Anyways, keep in touch. Our paths will definitely cross in the future.  All the best for your future endeavors.","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":true,"_id":"60a96247819323d199d4941d"}]}]'
