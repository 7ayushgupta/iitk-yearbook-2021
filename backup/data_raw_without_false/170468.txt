Then during the internship season (ok..,I accept we didn\'t work hard enough ), but you still utilized your time better. Then do you remember development economics midsem , you had read everything and then you taught me(now please don\'t take your mind to grades) . I was amazed to listen your internship story, the kind of hard work you did was extraordinary. \\n\\nYou have been a constant support right through.

You have  a niche\' of saying right things at right time\xf0\x9f\x98\x82. \\nYou were a great support during the lockdown and placement process. You were the one who told me about zerodha and kaggle. Without these I would surely not have been at Blackrock.\\nI have always loved the kind of connection you make with people. You put efforts for the friendships to work(I should also say relationships to work\xf0\x9f\x98\x9b). I really hope I learn this from you. \\n\\nVery thankful for that day when you asked all of us to sing solo(you people were a very good audience, I Would have surely laughed if I was in the audience \xf0\x9f\x98\x82).

You planned all the things we did in last 1.5 months. You are the glue of our group, you keep everyone together. You have this ability of thinking about the group before yourself.  Again, commendable!!! \\n\\nYou are going to excel in anything that you do, but i really hope you find clarity soon. (And please don\'t overthink after making that decision)\\nI know, I haven\'t talked about relationships here (sorry \xf0\x9f\x98\x82, \xe0\xa4\x85\xe0\xa4\xac \xe0\xa4\xb6\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa5\x80 \xe0\xa4\x95\xe0\xa5\x80 \xe0\xa4\x89\xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xb0 \xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa5\x88 \xe0\xa4\xa4\xe0\xa5\x81\xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa5\x80)\\n\\nAnd yes...

I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all (you know how clean I keep my room, and in the future too I will get mad if you do anything to my room). But I think that was the point we became best friends. You inspired me a lot. This summer help me to know you better. Your time management skills, your focus on the study work, how you feel guilt for not doing anything productive in a day, etc. There are lots and lots of quality you have that cannot be described in words.\\nI end up getting the difficult courses always, but the inspiration you gave me helped me always from 2nd year to still continuing;). The way we pulled together Fluids, Development Economics, and now IME 634. You have been a constant support right through. You guys are the major reason for my decent grades and my placement. I always wanted to know how you make such a kind of connection with people. Your efforts for friendships and bonds.

But you should know I play better badminton than you as I am the king\xf0\x9f\x98\x8e) (I won the championship\xe2\x80\xa6 hahaha). But you always put full efforts into taking our photos.

You are the glue which holds the group together. You think of others before yourself. You are a keen observer. You exert warm aura of hospitality.

Revisiting your whole schedule of day in mind, and then assessing what changes can be made to optimise time further. You are empathetic. You are sincere to your feelings. Your learning agility, optimism and zeal to contribute for the betterment of the society are beyond praise. You have the quality of leader as well as traits of a good team member.
