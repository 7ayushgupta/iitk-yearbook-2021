If I ever made the right decision in college, it was choosing you as my roommate. Itna ideal kaise ho sakte ho bhaaii!\\nTo this date as well, I hate those memories of your early morning coffee ke nashe and then subah subah pooja karke, you used to give me prasad in sleep. I was an idiot to mention this to my parents and I still get scoldings to be like you. Never had I ever seen someone actually use an alarm that requires you to solve math puzzles to snooze off. One thing that I missed the most was your shoulder massages (bhai bhai). I never feared about missing my breakfast because of you and even when I missed it, you used to bring me sprouts. Wing ki maaa tha tu. Oh and how can I forget forcing you into girls, lolol.\\nYou are some sort of a weird person in yourself but we missed you during the last days. All the very best for anything you aspire to achieve.
