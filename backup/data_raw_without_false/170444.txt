So, what does it matter if you lost your world, it\'s not over yet, you can always build a new one, even better this time!!! And there are no paths, just relatively lesser dense forests that lead you to specific point, that you don\'t even know, if you\'d like! So, you can always make new and just move towards your own heading into the unknown, what worst can happen!!
