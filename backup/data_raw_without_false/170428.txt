Yaar ye plan execute kyu nahi ho pate, pehle voh wall painting ka fir yeh PSY ka. Jokes apart, just wanted to say it was good to have known you be it as a sportsperson, for us we have our daily fights and I have seen you struggle and the way you have handled the stress and pressure during times is very commendable. You have shown a better version of your self on the court always.\\nAlso wanted to convey a message for the whole team through you (always been a shy guy never been in touch with you all\xf0\x9f\x98\x94) for my second team. Spent so much time with you all in the court training or playing matches, so many treats, oat rooftop hangouts. But what stood out always was the amount of hard work you all have put in to improve yourself in such a short span of time along with the fun involved. For you as a captain motivating the whole team and someone with a humour level of Dadu can be really hard \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3. Huge respect for managing that.
