I have kept in touch with you daily in the last few years. Whether it was covid or not, we have talked almost every day \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa9. We have seen each other go through rough times \xf0\x9f\x98\xa3 and helped each other through them \xf0\x9f\x98\x87, whether it be CSE stress, girl troubles, or just random existential dread - BT. The numerous meals we have had \xf0\x9f\xa5\x98, whether it be at Hall-5,12 or chick blast \xf0\x9f\x8d\x9c or Dominos \xf0\x9f\x8d\x95 or BBQ \xf0\x9f\x8d\x97 or Bazooka \xf0\x9f\x8c\xaf or Momos \xf0\x9f\xa5\x9f,  have been priceless not because of the food, but cuz you and so many of our friends were there with me. The basketball games \xf0\x9f\x8f\x80 we have played have been the peak points of my daily life at IITK. The CSE group projects/labs \xf0\x9f\x92\xbb we have done together make me realize how much I will miss working with you in the future. We have gone from not knowing what coding is to becoming IITK CSE grads. Thank you so much for all the priceless memories and the unconditional support you have given me \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f. IITK wouldn\'t be the same without you man \xf0\x9f\xa5\xba. I wish you all the best in life bro \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d, and I know one day you will achieve all things you wanna \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9e.

Bhai kaha se shuru karu samajh nhi aara\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\\n\\nI just want to say that I am so grateful that our paths crossed in these four years. PE101 &102 mai same group mai hone se lekar basketball tk tere saath jo time spend kia vo humesha mst hi raha yar. Asli maja lekin summer camp mai aaya. Summer camp mai humne khub maje kie saath mai aur khub bonding bhi hui. Basketball court se hum thake haare vaapas aate the aur haste haste din nikaal dete the. Summer camp mere in 4 saalo mai sbse best time tha and you were one of the reasons for it. Summer camp ka time yaad krta hu to aisa lagta hai jaise camp koi sapna tha, kyunki hum us time bs khaate, khelte aur soya krte the. But vo time bhut mst tha yar aur jo humaari team thi vo bhi sb mst bnde the. \\n\\nAcads ki wajah se basketball continue nhi kr paae 2nd year Udhgosh ke baad se but dost to humesha hi rahenge. Summer camp ke baad kaafi baar mulakaat hui, kabhi OAT mai, kbhi acads area mai aur 1 2 baar mai tere room ki taraf bhi aaya tha. Mulaakat to jitni hui, km hi hui but I am happy ki mulaakate hoti rahi. \\n\\nFourth year jo 10 12 din mai saath basketball khela (March \xe2\x80\x9921 mai), bhut accha laga. Aisa laga jaise we were reliving the whole Summer Camp experience again. We were so lucky ki between the first and the second wave, 50 din hi sahi but campus khula and graduation se pehle ek baar milne kaa mauka mila hume!  Basketball khelne ka alag hi maza tha IITK mai. 1 1.5 ghanta jb court pe hote the, aisa lagta tha jaise apni saari problems kuch time ke lie gaayab hogyi ho.\\n\\nBhai, thank you so much for all the experiences that we had together. It has been so much fun to know you. I will miss you and our Snapchat streak a lot (I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we went up to 100 days!!!). I wish you all the success in the world bhai. Mujhe ye belief hai ki tu life mai jo karega mst krega bro. May you find your purpose and have a fulfilled, successful and prosperous life. Stay healthy and happy bro. Take care.
