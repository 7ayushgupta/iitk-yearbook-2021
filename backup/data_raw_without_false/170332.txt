You\'re this amazing, pure, quite adventurous (sneaky) and talented person. I\'ll cherish all the time I\'ve spent with you that night in OAT or the walks in the academic area.

I recall that our first project together was creating an egg basket game in processing software where the basket was controlled using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. We also made an application using Android Studio. \\n\\nI am amazed by your knowledge of places to visit on the campus. Before I met you, I was not aware of sites like the oxidation pond behind OAT and the IIT K nursery at the end of the road to the auditorium. \\n\\nI was glad that you continued in the E club after the summer project on Skin Track. We jointly conducted many events for the club. Even after your tenure as a secy was over, you remained in touch with club activities. I recall that you had borrowed the LED strip from the club to celebrate your friend\'s birthday. You are really good at organizing surprise birthday celebrations for your friends. I recall that you had planned my birthday celebration in the Lecture Hall complex in my third year (However, it was not a surprise for me since you had invited Apurv, who leaked the info about your planning)\\n\\n\\nAlthough we didn\'t do many courses together, the one course we did together was the ENG course by Prof Ravichandran on \\"Literature and the Individual.\\" I recall that we had rehearsed the debate of Kafka\'s \\" The metamorphosis.\\" The debate was supposed to be on the spot, but prof never realized that we had decided our points-counterpoints beforehand! \\n\\nIt is great that you, too, have plans to pursue graduate studies in the US. I hope that we will meet sometime soon. I will be happy to help you with your grad school applications.\\nAll the best for your thesis work here and all future endeavors.\\n","author":"Nitish Vikas Deshpande","visibility":true,"_id":"60a66750819323d199d48fa6"}]}]'
