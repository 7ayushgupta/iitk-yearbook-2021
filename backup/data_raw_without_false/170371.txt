We both were working in the same sub-system and were assigned the task of understanding the mecanum wheel system and simulating it in ROS and Gazebo. I recall that we had also started recording videos for creating the lecture series on Arduino for ERA.  Later, you decided to quit ERA and pursue your interests in other areas.  Anyways, I hope that you were able to devote time to pursue your other interests and I hope that you did not regret quitting ERA. \\n\\nOur areas of interest are quite different now.
