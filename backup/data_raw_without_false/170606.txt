I remember meeting you for the first time during core team selection and how you just barged out of the room when they called out your name. I was like wow so dramatic :p. From judging you for being dramatic that day to being dramatic with you, we have definitely come a long way. I am so glad we had those deep conversations during summers and came to know how similar (or dissimilar)  we are. I love how you add a spark to every party or hangout session and I missed this spark a lot during these last two months on the campus. Will always remember the first day at Goa when you took Arzoo and me for a \\"ahem\\" session bahar. Really admire how fit you\'ve become now and totally don\'t feel good about how much I suck at losing weight :P Whichever path you choose in the future, wishing you lots of good luck for that, you\'ll for sure do well!\\nLove you dost, miss you \\"bahuuttt hi zyaddaaa\\" <3\\nP.S.
