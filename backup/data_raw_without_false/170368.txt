Bro, how are you doing? \\nIt was worthwhile to have you, Aditya and Shubham in the adjacent room in the freshman year. The memories that we made in that short time itself are priceless. I remember that time when a bunch of 3rd years from 2-Bot caught us so happy that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it and took us to the lawn and asked me to sing and you to dance to it. I never told you, but I was terrified that night and the only reason I felt safe was that you were there with me and I thought, I have my friend by my side and whatever happens, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get through this together. Contrary to our apprehension, the night took a rather hilarious turn, and we got an anecdote to laugh our asses off for the rest of our lives. I remember those numerous nights, when you, Shubham and I used to get together and mess with anyone we could possibly find in the wing (mostly, Tamonud \xe2\x80\x93 Sorry Tamonud!) and used to make so much noise that Aditya could never sleep. And I remember the night before the PHY103 midsem when we pulled a night out in CC and you helped me get through all the tutorials and notes so that I could pass the next day. And I did. \\n\\nI remember the few but glorious trips that we took to BBQ or malls to watch a movie. Also, the time you and Tamonud treated the whole wing there (We love you for it!). I remember the time we watched Avengers: Infinity War (me, you, Aditya and Tamonud) and had to walk kilometres afterwards to find a ride back to college (What a day it was!). \\n\\nI remember the times in the sophomore, junior and senior years when I called on you for advice and guidance and you never turned me away, and the times you watched out for me when I was crashing academically. I also remember the innumerable times you helped me find greater clarity about my life and the times you saw me through my various never-ending crises and ever-recurring crossroads. \\nI thank you for every one of these times. Thank you for being by my side, thank you for taking the time, thank you for every one of your advice, thank you for all the fun times, thank you for everything. \\n\\nLastly, may I add how breath-taking it was to have had the chance to watch you grow and become this fabulous individual that you have become. That stooped, awkward kid that walked uneasily through the gates of Hall 03 in July 2017, inconfident, is now this confident, mature and more-learned-than-ever leader that is walking out head held high with a blazing charisma, having touched and enriched hundreds of lives, including mine. The way that you have lived these four years, fully and joyfully, inspires me and will continue to inspire me throughout my life. It is an honour to know you and have you as my bhai. I was very lucky that our paths crossed and I, whole-heartedly and unconditionally, wish you the best in life. May you be a thousand times more successful than anyone who has ever lived, and may you rise to your full potential, because you are INFINITE my friend.

Dekho chaapu to tum ho hi, chaapu se mera mtlb dono padhai aur personality se hai. Humne kaafi masti ki hai vaise, Antaragni me naache hai, treats me gaye hai, bakchodiyan bhi ki hai. Phir bhi lagta hai ke humari jitni baate honi chahiye thi utni nahi hui, campus me ek ya do raat tumhare sath ghumte hue aur bitayi hoti, tumhe aur jaana hota, kuch aur der gale lagaya hota, daaru pi hoti, aur Rohan ke jaane par tumhare saamne roya bhi hota.\\nHaalaki mujhe itna sochne ki zarurat nahi kyunki humari mulaakate to hoti hi rahegi, tab sab karenge (No HOMO).

Feeling happy, sad, excited about something, frustrated, want to vent out, angry or bored - Just text Deepak!. Also, thanks for the Netflix account and midnight gossip sessions. Antaragni ke time pe tere tinder account chalane meh bada maza aaya tha (my first time using tinder :p). Thanks for ameeronka chocolate XD. \\nFeel good about yourself, you are unique, and you got a lot of friends.\\nTere calls kabhi ignore ni karoongi, not even drunk calls.

You make everyone around you comfortable, people who know you absolutely love you including me.

You were truly a blessing to the team. \\nYour personality is something I\'ve always and I will always admire bro. One can talk about anything to you, from mental health to jokes on not-so-appropriate topics. OH, AND WHO CAN FORGET THE SPAMMER SIDE OF DM!!! \\nThe more fun memories that we made were towards the end when I learned that you can dance so well (khaskar vo 1-2 steps). I hope to scream LSD!!!! LSD!!!! LSD!!!! again very soon. Those Inference quizzes were fun too, kya hi karte the yaar. AJAYRAJ ke room mein usi ki udana still remains on top.
