It is very difficult for any friendship to go so long. We both are very thankful to god that everything happened in our favour. I came to know you during our JEE preparations at FIITJEE. Initially I thought...ya, seems like a nice guy...started talking...and eventually became good friends while helping each other in solving fiitjee booklets. U remember anshu? that fight between us...MTH publication k book ko leke...i refused to give it to you, and u stopped talking to me...was kidding man\xf0\x9f\x98\x82...and then we became very good friends.

And, ofc how can we both forget that traumatic period of my life\xf0\x9f\x98\xa2...man i just can\xe2\x80\x99t tell how i would have been if u were not there. I am really really thankful to you bhai.

But, how could I forget that Nainital trip man. Bhai, mai maut ko takk se choo k wapas aa gya tha...it was scary..but i really enjoyed it man. The funniest trip was our regular Patna trip. Sutta fukna at every Patna trip.

Bhai, to ek din bhukha aata tha, paisa wasool krne k liye. and ghar jakar pta chlta tha ki you have gained 5 kgs of weight...i mean are you for real??? And itne khane wale bnde ko achanak se diet follow krna, i can\xe2\x80\x99t believe my eyes. Jo bhi ho, you are following it strictly, and yes huge respect for this. Aur bhai, wo 85 kg wali bet ko jyada serious mt le yar, gareeb aadmi ko jeene nhi doge kya\xf0\x9f\x98\x82. The most hilarious and memorable trip to Patna was of course Jan\xe2\x80\x9921.
