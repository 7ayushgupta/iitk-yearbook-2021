I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember when did we meet for the first time. I think it was the TA lab and I thought damn saare CSE walo ko group in kar Diya hai yaha toh sare maggu log honge. But there were us!! Bunch of nerds trying to seek fun in things that were not that intereseting and boy did that turn out well. I always admired you for the level of hardwork that you put into things and I really feel it is your best quality. There is one thing however that I think you should know and it is that you are an extra ordinary person bruh. You may not believe it at times and think that you are just an ordinary guy who would not be able to do much but I know you\'re not. You\'re awesome!! Itna sab kuch karke bhi FB stories me positivity failaate ho logon me. You surely lift up spirits too!! There were times when I was not feeling good but you were there - sharing wholesome memes, laughing at the silly jokes that I used to slip in between and yet helping me out in academics at the same time. Thanks for that, thanks for existing. I cant imagine what would have been my situation in some of the courses if you were not there. I love how you also have a similar taste in music and also the feel good memes and the literature as well!! Baki bro mai tumhe kya time management sikhau tum khud itni saari cheeze manage karte ho- you are really breathtaking. I was not really a nightout wala guy in the first year. But when I met you in 4th sem and saw you just flipping the side of the match just through nights -  i was really motivated ( lmao you did a DS assignment once throughout the night and I was really awestruck. I thought ye bande ka ye assignment toh gaya time hi nai bacha hai and there were you!! Damn it was the first time I saw someone do that tbh and later on tumhare saath reh reh ke mai wo bhi sikh gaya) . I do not have much words how to thank you and I can not yet imagine what would the journey look like without you in it., Because seriously, you were there with me in the darkest semester - I remember all the nightouts and countless deadlines and the scary nights of OS. You were there all the times and you helped me get through it. Thanks a lot. Baki bro, milte hai Noida me Party karenge saath me and bakchodiya karenge aur bhi!! All the best for your future - no doubt tum chaapoge aage bhi!!
